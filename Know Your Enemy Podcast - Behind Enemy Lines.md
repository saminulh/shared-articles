## Behind Enemy Lines

This episode was an introduction to the podcast and the hosts

- They mention that Cory Robin's in "The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump" argues that conservatism is fundamentally a reactionary movement, in particular a reaction to the loss (or threat of loss) of power. 
- Matt mentioned that one of the initial cracks in his conservatism came from watching his peers defend torture in the Iraq war. This reminds me of my initial cracks with libertarianism coming from watching figures such as Stephan Molyneux and others defend ideas (on the right) that started to seem "clearly" morally wrong to me (unfortunately I have trouble remembering the examples).
- Funny Quote: Often its not "facts don't care about your feelings its feelings don't care about your facts"
- Its worth noting that one of Matt's (leftist) mentors Micheal Kazin argued: "no Democrat will win the presidency in 2020 unless she or he can mobilize a broad coalition in which socialists would still be a distinct minority. In the United States, a strategic alliance between liberals and leftists is the only way durable changes have ever been won ... Abolitionists who joined the Republican Party drove Radical Reconstruction; union activists with socialist convictions helped make the Democrats a semblance of a labor party in big industrial states; the black freedom movement worked with white liberals to pass the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. Such coalitions were short-lived and frustrated radicals who wanted more far-reaching results. But when liberals and leftists remained at odds, as during the final decades of the past century, they made it easier for the right to triumph." Perhaps this might explain why they seem less antagonistic to liberals than other leftists (although maybe they will discuss their views on liberalism in future episodes).

## How Conservatives Argue

The main topic of this episode was Albert Hirschman's 1991 book "The Rhetoric of Reaction"
