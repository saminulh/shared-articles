## Food for Thought

- They mention that Cory Robin's in "The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump" argues that conservatism is fundamentally a reactionary movement, in particular a reaction to the loss (or threat of loss) of power. 
- Matt mentioned that one of the initial cracks in his conservatism came from watching his peers defend torture in the Iraq war. This reminds me of my initial cracks with libertarianism coming from watching figures such as Stephan Molyneux and others defend ideas (on the right) that started to seem "clearly" morally wrong to me (unfortunately I have trouble remembering the examples).
