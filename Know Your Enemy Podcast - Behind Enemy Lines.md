## Behind Enemy Lines

This episode was an introduction to the podcast and the hosts

- They mention that Cory Robin's in "The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump" argues that conservatism is fundamentally a reactionary movement, in particular a reaction to the loss (or threat of loss) of power. 
- Matt mentioned that one of the initial cracks in his conservatism came from watching his peers defend torture in the Iraq war. This reminds me of my initial cracks with libertarianism coming from watching figures such as Stephan Molyneux and others defend ideas (on the right) that started to seem "clearly" morally wrong to me (unfortunately I have trouble remembering the examples).
- Funny Quote: Often its not "facts don't care about your feelings its feelings don't care about your facts"
- Its worth noting that one of Matt's (leftist) mentors Micheal Kazin argued: "no Democrat will win the presidency in 2020 unless she or he can mobilize a broad coalition in which socialists would still be a distinct minority. In the United States, a strategic alliance between liberals and leftists is the only way durable changes have ever been won ... Abolitionists who joined the Republican Party drove Radical Reconstruction; union activists with socialist convictions helped make the Democrats a semblance of a labor party in big industrial states; the black freedom movement worked with white liberals to pass the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. Such coalitions were short-lived and frustrated radicals who wanted more far-reaching results. But when liberals and leftists remained at odds, as during the final decades of the past century, they made it easier for the right to triumph." Perhaps this might explain why they seem less antagonistic to liberals than other leftists (although maybe they will discuss their views on liberalism in future episodes).

## How Conservatives Argue

The main topic of this episode was Albert Hirschman's 1991 book "The Rhetoric of Reaction"

- Modern conservatives begins with the French Revolution and Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France"
- In discussing the futility thesis, Hirschman mentions that it is also used by radical leftists who push back against incremental reform. Sam mentions that he doesn't know where he stands on the "revolutionary vs reform" argument taking place among the left. 
- In addressing his leftist critique of the "Synergy Illusion"  Matt mentions that he agrees that it is a cautionary tail for leftists that there are costs to reform but that the left deems them worth it. I think this hilariously misses the point.

## How Conservatives Argue

* Perversity thesis: If you try to effect some change you will inevitably do the opposite
* Futility thesis: Whatever you try won't work
* Jeopardy thesis: Change will cause other previous benefits to be lost
