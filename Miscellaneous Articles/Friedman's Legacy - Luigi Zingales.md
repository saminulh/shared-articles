This article is a (50th anniversary) follow-up to [[Milton Friedman]]'s famous influential New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html) on the social responsibility of business.

## Reading Notes 

>_Friedman was more right than his detractors claim and more wrong than his supporters would like us to believe. However, after 50 years of lax enforcement and a digital revolution that increased network externalities and created digital monopolies, we cannot continue to assume we live in a society where there are no monopolies and where corporations do not have much influence on legislation, as Friedman did._

- While Friedman had some good ideas his assumption that we live in a society without monopolies or lack of corporate influence on politics has been proven false. 

> In the popular press, Friedman’s principle is treated as a matter of religion; while in the more formal academic publications, it is ignored (after all, it was not written as a formal theorem).

- Difference between how the article was treated in the popular press vs academia. 

>First of all, there are two ways to read Friedman’s contribution. Is Friedman writing about what is optimal for shareholders or what is optimal for society? The title seems to suggest the second interpretation, but in the text, Friedman focuses mostly on the first.

- There are two interpretations to Friedman's article: "What is optimal for shareholders or what is optimal for society?"

>The problem was that in the _New York Times_ piece, Friedman’s idea was not stated as theorem, but literally as a “doctrine,” triggering a religious reaction, rather than a more balanced academic response.

- Friedman's idea was taken as a "religious" doctrine

> Five decades later, it is important to fix this mistake and restate Friedman as a theorem. Under what conditions is it socially efficient for managers to focus only on maximizing shareholder value? First, companies should operate in a competitive environment, which I will define as firms being both price _and_ rules takers. Second, there should not be externalities (or the government should be able to address perfectly these externalities through regulation and taxation). Third, contracts are complete, in the sense that we can specify in a contract all relevant contingencies at no cost.

- Can you specify under what conditions Friedman's principle is socially optimal? The author gives some ideas. 

>Any well-trained economist will recognise that my formulation of the Friedman Separation Theorem is nothing more than a restatement of the celebrated [First Welfare Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics), establishing the social optimality of competitive equilibria. Proven in its generality by Arrow and Debreu in 1951, this idea was initially relegated to the abstractions of mathematical economics. Friedman has the merit to see the tremendous practical implications of this theorem and to push it into the real world.

- The First Welfare Theorem states that competitive equilibria are Pareto optimal.

> we need to confront the fact that corporations are born with an original sin: the ability to externalize some of their costs. While limited liability vis-à-vis contractual claimants can be achieved via ordinary market contracting, limited liability vis-à-vis tort claimants is a privilege granted by the State.

- Corporations have the ability to externalize some of their costs

Yet, it is important to remember that corporations are not just purely contractual entities; they are granted by the State an extraordinary privilege and, thus, the State itself can demand something in exchange for this privilege. The British Academy goes too far in this direction, asking to reintroduce an [explicit mandatory social purpose for corporations.](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/programmes/future-of-the-corporation/) This is a very dangerous position because it delegates to the state the right to decide not only what is good and what is bad, but also which business can be pursued and which one cannot, undermining the freedom of enterprise. But some milder mandates (more on this later) could be justified.

- Given the privileges granted to corporations it makes sense that the state can demand something from corporations in return. 

> Having understood that when it comes to corporations the production of externalities is a feature, not a bug, we are left assessing how good the government is at addressing these externalities. As economists, our preferred way to deal with externalities is taxation (referred to as Pigouvian taxes). As I explain in my book, _[A Capitalism for the People](https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-People-Recapturing-American-Prosperity/dp/0465085954)_, political economy considerations make the approval of Pigouvian taxes very difficult. Just look at the carbon tax, [overwhelmingl](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-tax/)[y](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-tax/) [supported by economists](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-tax/), but rejected even in the most liberal states of the union. Thus, claiming that Pigouvian taxes will address all the externalities is untenable.

- Taxing externalities is popular among economists but hard to get support for politically

> [Oliver Hart and I](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hart/files/108.00000022-hart-vol2no2-jlfa-0022_002.pdf) show that Friedman’s result only holds in the knife-edge case when a company does not have any comparative advantage vis-à-vis shareholders in pursuing a social objective. This is certainly the case for corporate charity. One dollar donated by Microsoft is equally as effective as a dollar donated by me. Yet, it is not the case for most other social objectives. It is cheaper not to pollute than to pollute and clean up. It is cheaper not to sell guns to the Saudi than to do so and then help the Yemen refugees, and so on and so forth. Why should companies pursue the maximization of monetary returns at the expense of the social goals of their investors? If I am a 100 percent owner of a company, I will be running it to maximize my utility, not my wealth. Why should it be different when many of us own it? The modified Friedman principle should be that managers should maximize shareholders’ _welfare,_ not value.

- If a company has a comparative advantage to pursuing a social objective than it is more efficient for that company to pursue that social objective rather than to maximize profits and have those additional profits be spent on pursuing the social objective.  

>Information costs aside, can these externalities be resolved by the private sector? In [a recent paper with Eleonora Broccardo and Oliver Hart](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27710), we show that if the (wealth weighted) majority of investors are even slightly altruistic and if they are well diversified, then they will vote as a benevolent planner would, so they will lead companies to internalize externalities. Thus, there is hope that shareholder democracy could fix even this problem, but only if we let democracy work.

- If the board of a corporation is slightly altruistic and well diversified than they would internalize externalities. 

>After 50 years of lax enforcement and a digital revolution that increased network externalities and created many digital monopolies, we cannot be so cavalier. Consider Google’s choice of how to rank news about political candidates. [Experimental evidence](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/E4512) shows that searches leading to a higher ranking of bad news about a political candidate result in fewer votes for that candidate. A board that maximizes profits would tweak the search results to disadvantage those candidates who want to tax Google or to break it up. In a competitive market, reputation prevents these abuses, but Google is a de facto monopolist. It will take a lot of abuses for a customer to switch to Bing. Do we want Google to manipulate elections?

- Monopolistic firms like Google are rules makers rather than rules takers. 

> While Friedman was well aware that the “price taker” assumption could be violated, he was not equally aware of the “rule taker” assumption. In his essay, he states that corporations should “make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society” as if these rules were exogenously given. Only six months after Friedman wrote his _NYT_ piece, [George Stigler](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003160?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) published his regulatory capture piece in an academic journal, explaining how regulated companies distort regulation in their favor against the public interest.

- Friedman seemed unconcerned with the ability of corporations to manipulate the law (rules makers rather than rules takers). 

>Thus, in 2020, how should we interpret the practical implications of Friedman’s idea? If you are a small to medium-sized company, let’s say Chuck E. Cheese, a company with no market power and no real power to influence regulation or elections, maximizing shareholder welfare is the right goal to follow. Especially if this goal is pursued with attention not only to legal rules but also ethical customs, like Friedman advocated, but most companies ignored.

>When it comes to super corporations, corporations that have market power, like Google and Facebook, or political power, like BlackRock or JP Morgan, or regulatory power, like DuPont or Monsanto, a single-minded pursuit of shareholder value maximization can be extremely bad for society. This is the reason why [Oliver Hart and I](https://promarket.org/2019/06/21/dear-graduates-heres-what-you-can-do-to-change-capitalism-for-the-better/) have advocated requiring boards of monopolies, like Google, or of firms too big to regulate, like Blackrock, to maximize social welfare, the utility of society as a whole, not shareholder welfare.

- Small companies that have no market or political power are fine to maximize shareholder welfare but large companies with market or political power should instead maximize the utility of society as a whole. 

How do we convince a board elected by the shareholders to maximize social welfare? The simple answer is that we impose an additional fiduciary duty toward society, in addition to the existing one toward shareholders. This fiduciary duty would make directors personally liable (for a multiple of the director’s fee they receive), if the company inefficiently pollutes, influences legislation, or abuses its monopoly power.

- The authors suggest that large corporations should have a fiduciary duty towards society.

- Re [[#^c5cf6e]]: Interesting, but very skeptical things would play out this way in practice.
