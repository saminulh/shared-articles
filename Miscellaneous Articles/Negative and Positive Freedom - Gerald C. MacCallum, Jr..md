# Excerpts

> This paper challenges the view that we may usefully distinguish between two kinds or concepts of political and social freedom-negative and positive. The argument is not that one of these is the only, the "truest," or the "most worthwhile" freedom, but rather that the distinction between them has never been made sufficiently clear, is based in part upon a serious confusion, and has drawn attention away from precisely what needs examining if the differences separating philosophers, ideologies, and social movements concerned with freedom are to be understood. The corrective advised is to regard freedom as always one and the same triadic relation, but recognize that various contending parties disagree with each other in what they understand to be the ranges of the term variables. To view the matter in this way is to release oneself from a prevalent but unrewarding concentration on "kinds" of freedom, and to turn attention toward the truly important issues in this area of social and political philosophy.

- The paper challenges the view that we may usefully distinguish between positive and negative freedoms and proposes instead that we should view freedom as a triadic relationship (where disagreement occurs over the variables the relationship may vary over). 

> Further, any of the above disputes may stem from or turn into a dispute about what freedom is. The borderlines have never been easy to keep clear. But a reason for this especially worth noting at the start is that disputes about the nature of freedom are certainly historically best understood as a series of attempts by parties opposing each other on very many issues to capture for their own side the favorable attitudes attaching to the notion of freedom. It has commonly been advantageous for partisans to link the presence or absence of freedom as closely as possible to the presence or absence of those other social benefits believed to be secured or denied by the forms of social organization advocated or condemned. Each social benefit is, accordingly, treated as either a result of or a contribution to freedom, and each liability is connected somehow to the absence of freedom. This history of the matter goes far to explain how freedom came to be identified with so many different kinds of social and individual benefits, and why the status of freedom as simply one among a number of social benefits has remained unclear. The resulting flexibility of the notion of freedom, and the resulting enhancement of the value of freedom, have suited the purposes of the polemicist.

- Historically the definition of freedom has been adapted to portray social benefits of the users preferred form of social organisation as a form of freedom and the liabilities of opposing forms of social organisation as a lack of freedom.

> Whenever the freedom of some agent or agents is in question, it is always freedom from some constraint or restriction on, interference with, or barrier to doing, not doing, becoming, or not becoming something.' Such freedom is thus always of something (an agent or agents), from something, to do, not do, become, or not become something; it is a triadic relation. Taking the format "x is (is not) free from y to do (not do, become, not become) z," x ranges over agents,y ranges over such "preventing conditions" as constraints, restrictions, interferences, and barriers, and z ranges over actions or conditions of character or circumstance.

- Definition of freedom as a triadic relation. 

> That the intelligibility of talk concerned with the freedom of agents rests in the end upon an understanding of freedom as a triadic relation is what many persons distinguishing between positive and negative freedom apparently fail to see or see clearly enough. Evidence of such failure or, alternatively, invitation to it is found in the simple but conventional characterization of the difference between the two kinds of freedom as the difference between "freedom from" and "freedom to"-a characterization suggesting that freedom could be either of two dyadic relations. This characterization, however, cannot distinguish two genuinely different kinds of freedom; it can serve only to emphasize one or the other of two features of every case of the freedom of agents. Consequently, anyone who argues that freedom from is the "only" freedom, or that freedom to is the "truest" freedom, or that one is "more important than" the other, cannot be taken as having said anything both straightforward and sensible about two distinct kinds of freedom. He can, at most, be said to be attending to, or emphasizing the importance of only one part of what is always present in any case of freedom.

[[negative_and_positive_freedoms.pdf#page=8&selection=38,0,74,38|negative_and_positive_freedoms, page 8]]

- Talk of negative freedom (freedom from) and positive freedom (freedom to)  does not distinguish between two types of freedom but rather emphasizes different parts of the triadic relation.

> The most obvious thing to be said about these characterizations, of course, is that appeal to them provides at best an excessively crude justification of the conventional classification of writers into opposing camps. When one presses on the alleged points of difference, they have a tendency to break down, or at least to become less dramatic than they at first seemed.8 As should not be surprising, the patterns of agreement and disagreement on these several points are in fact either too diverse or too indistinct to support any clearly justifiable arrangement of major writers into two camps. The trouble is not merely that some writers do not fit too well where they have been placed; it is rather that writers who are purportedly the very models of membership in one camp or the other (for example, Locke, the Marxists) do not fit very well where they have been placed9-thus suggesting that the whole system of dichotomous classification is futile and, even worse, conducive to distortion of important views on freedom.

[[negative_and_positive_freedoms.pdf#page=11&selection=20,0,30,61|negative_and_positive_freedoms, page 11]]

- The views of various thinkers on freedom do not fit neatly into two opposing camps (negative and positive freedoms) as some (like Isiah Berlin) claim. The triadic notion of freedom allows each of these thinkers views to be understood as allowing the variables to vary over a different range (which may have both "negative" and "positive" elements). 

>In contrast, much might trouble us in the accounts of the so- called adherents of "positive" freedom. They sometimes do not count, as the agent whose freedom is being considered, what inheritors of our tradition would unhesitatingly consider to be a "person." Instead, they occasionally engage in what has been revealingly but pejoratively called "the retreat to the inner citadel" ; the agent in whose freedom they are interested is identified as the "real" or the "rational" or the "moral" person who is somehow sometimes hidden within, or has his seed contained within, the living human body. Sometimes, however, rather than a retreat to such an "inner citadel," or sometimes in addition to such a retreat, there is an expansion of the limits of "person" such that the in- stitutions and members, the histories and futures of the com- munities in which the living human body is found are considered to be inextricable parts of the "person." These expansions or contractions of the criteria for identifi- cation of persons may seem unwarranted to us. Whether they are so, however, depends upon the strength of the arguments offered in support of the helpfulness of regarding persons in these ways while discussing freedom. For example, the retreat to the "inner citadel" may be initiated simply by worries about which, of all the things we want, will give us lasting satisfaction- a view of our interests making it possible to see the surge of impulse or passion as an obstacle to the attainment of what we "really want." And the expansion of the limits of the "self" to include our families, cultures, nations, or races may be launched by awareness that our "self" is to some extent the product of these associations; by awareness that our identification of our interests may be influenced by our beliefs concerning ways in which our destinies are tied to the destinies of our families, nations and so forth; by the way we see tugs and stresses upon those associations as tugs and stresses upon us; and by the ways we see ourselves and identify ourselves as officeholders in such associations with the rights and obligations of such offices. This expansion, in turn, makes it possible for us to see the infringement of autonomy of our associations as infringement on our freedom.

[[negative_and_positive_freedoms.pdf#page=14&selection=0,24,70,48|negative_and_positive_freedoms, page 14]]

- The arguments for identifying persons with their "inner citadel" or allowing associations as agents (both often employed by proponents of positive freedom) rests of the helpfulness of regarding agents this way while discussing freedom. 

> But what should be observed is that this set of seemingly radical departures by adherents of positive freedom from the ways "we" ordinarily identify persons does not provide us with any reason whatever to claim that a different concept offreedom is involved (one might as well say that the shift from "The apple is to the left of the orange" to "The seeds of the apple are to the left of the seeds of the orange" changes what "to the left of" means). Furthermore, that claim would draw attention away from precisely what we should focus on; it would lead us to focus on the wrong concept-namely, "freedom" instead of "person." Only by insisting at least provi- sionally that all the writers have the same concept of freedom can one see clearly and keep sharply focused the obvious and extremely important differences among them concerning the concept of "person."

- Positive freedom is not a radically different concept than negative freedom. In many arguments between proponents of positive and negative freedom the argument should be about what constitutes an agent rather than the concept of freedom itself. 

> If the importance of this approach to discussion of freedom has been generally overlooked, it is because social and political philosophers have, with dreary regularity, made the mistake of trying to answer the unadorned question, "When are men free ?" or, alternatively, "When are men really free ?" These questions invite confusion and misunderstanding, largely of their tacit presumption that persons can be free or n simpliciter.

- Philosophers have often tried to answer the question "When are men really free?" 

> He is being helped to do what he really wants to do, or what he would want to do if he were reasonable (moral, prudent, or such like); compare Locke's words: "that ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and precipices."'18 Because of the "constraint" put upon him, a genuine constraint that was upon him (for example, ignorance, passion, the intrusions of others) is lifted, and he is free from the latter to do what he really wishes (or would wish if...) .

- Locke views freedom has having the ability to do the thing the thing he really issues (perhaps moral or rational) unencumbered by "constraints" such as passion or ignorance.

## Reading Notes

Re [[#^69a414]]: I think this is an important point for what I often want to argue. Positive freedoms are often argued to be more "natural" than others and this undermines that. 

Re [[#^76ced9]]: Similar point here.

Re [[#^0f8364]]: Rousseau expressed a similar viewpoint in [[The Social Contract - Jean-Jacques Rousseau#^c9ce7f|The Social Contract]].

## Final Thoughts

Brilliant.
