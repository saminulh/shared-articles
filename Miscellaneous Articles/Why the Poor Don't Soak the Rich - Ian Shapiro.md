>  To ask why there is so much inequality in modern-day democracies is to ask a loaded question. Why should we expect there to be less?

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=2&selection=4,1,8,29|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 2]]

- Why should we expect less inequality in modern-day democracies? 

> Such an expectation was nevertheless widely shared in the nineteenth century, both among conservatives who feared the economic implications of democracy and among socialists who welcomed democracy precisely because of its apparent economic implications. The Left and Right agreed : if majority rule and universal suffrage were introduced into a society marked by massive inequality, then most voters, being relatively poor, would inevitably favour taxing the rich and transferring the proceeds downward. I will call this the redistributive thesis.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=2&selection=12,0,40,17|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 2]]

- In the 19th century it was wildly believed that democracy would lead to transferring wealth from the rich to the poor (since the poor majority would vote for it). 

> This is one thesis that history has roundly refuted. Although there have been redistributive eras in capitalist democracies since the advent of a universal franchise, there has been no sysematic relationship between democracy and downward redistribution - not even a detectable relationship between the expansions of the franchise and episodes of downward redistribution.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=2&selection=42,1,60,27|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 2]]

- Democracy has not lead to downward redistribution of wealth (refuting the 19th century hypothesis). 

>  Similarly, in the post-communist world, the advent of democracy has been accompanied by the ostentatious growth of inequality. No doubt these developments owe at least as much to the introduction of capitalism as they do to democracy. Still, if the redistributive thesis is of interest, it must surely predict that a representative democracy will reverse - or at least retard - the regressive implications of market capitalism. Yet in practice, democracies often seem willing to tolerate growing inequality.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=3&selection=0,0,22,19|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 3]]

- Growth of inequality is likely due in large part to capitalism, but this still doesn't explain why democracies don't vote to redistribute the uneven gains as a result of the economic system. 

> There are several ways that social scientists have tried to explain this apparent anomaly. A number of them have pointed to the logic of democracy, the logic of capitalism, and the ways in which they interact. Such analysts argue that the propensity to demand down ward redistribution would be realized were it not for unexpected dynamics unleashed by the institutions of democracy and capitalism and their interaction

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=3&selection=24,0,46,4|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 3]]

- Some social scientists argue that the interaction between the logics of capitalism and democracy are what prevent this from happening.

> The expectation that democracies will redistribute downward is often motivated by the observation of poverty amid opulence. It seems reasonable to anticipate that the greater the manifest opulence of the few, the stronger will be the redistributive pressure from below. Paradoxically, however, something closer to the opposite may often be the case.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=3&selection=80,0,90,42|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 3]]

> Why this discrepancy? An important part of the answer, I think, lies in exposing a number of dubious assumptions about human psychology. Those who adhere to the redistributive thesis, be they Marxist, liberal, or conservative, usually assume that people in general keep themselves well informed about their place in the distribution of income and wealth, that the poor and middle classes compare themselves to the wealthy when thinking about what is feasible or just, and that those toward the bottom of the income distribution are like coiled springs - were it not for various external forces that are pressing them down, they would leap into action and demand a greater share of the economic pie. 

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=3&selection=98,0,132,17|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 3]]

> Every one of these assumptions is questionable - and every one of them deserves to be questioned.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=3&selection=136,0,138,26|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 3]]

- Proponents of the redistributive thesis assume that people compare themselves to those of different social and economic status (rather than more often comparing themselves tho others within their own status). 

> Aspirations do not form in vacuums. People must be able to picture realistically the goods for which they will strive. If the gap between where a per on is and where he or she might hope to be is too great, certain goods are likely to seem out of reach - and hence outside the range of realistic aspirations. There thus arises the possibility of an empathy gulf a situation in which people who are situated in one stratum of society may find it literally impossible to imagine the goods pursued by those in another. When levels of inequality are extremely high, such an empathy gulf might actually dampen redistributive demands from the very poor.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=3&selection=142,0,175,22|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 3]]

>  An extreme example will make this point. In modern-day Cape Town, it is common for domestic cleaners who live in squatters' camps to work for ten dollars a day cleaning half million dollar houses, where the cars in the garages cost many multiples of their expected lifetime earnings. It may just be impossible for the cleaners to picture themselves ever owning such a car, let alone the houses in which their owners live. You can see yourself stepping unaided over a puddle or a stream, perhaps even swimming a river, but not swimming the Atlantic ocean.

> Beyond certain thresholds that would have to be determined empirically, inequality may be expected to spawn empathy gulfs that dampen demands for change from below and reinforce the complacency of those who are rich. If the conditions for revolutionary social change are absent, and if a democratic order is seen as fundamentally legitimate, then the very existence of a vast gulf between rich and poor may very well reinforce the inegalitarian status quo. People will be more likely to blame others who are close to themselves in the social order for their plight rather than the wealthy, who seem unimaginably far away. This may fuel characteristic types of conflicts among different groups and classes toward the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, but it is unlikely to have much effect on the overall distribution of income and wealth.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=4&selection=66,7,90,5|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 4]]

- Inequality beyond certain thresholds may actually create "empathy gulfs" which reinforce the inegalitarian status quo. 

> An older sociology literature that runs from Max Weber to Frank Parkin suggests that in market systems most people think there is less inequality than there actually is, and that their relative position is better than it actually is. There is also an economics literature that seeks to explain people's apparently irrational beliefs about the prospects for their own upward mobility, and there is empirical research in social psychology that supports the notion that in formally egalitarian systems people opt for individual advancement rather than collective action to improve

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=4&selection=120,8,148,22|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 4]]

- Other reasons why voters wont make egalitarian demands include the fact that people overestimate their own social economic status and potential for upward mobility and that people often opt for individual advancement over collective action to improve their circumstances. 

> In the United States, at least, although people might be egalitarian in many facets of social life, they tend to accept economic outcomes as legitimate unless they seem to be both procedurally and substantively unfair. But this seldom happens, because the market is widely believed to be a fair distributive instrument. Jennifer Hochschild's 1995 study, Facing up to the "American Dream: Race, Class, and the Soul of the Nation", revealed a remarkably widespread endorsement of the idea that "skill rather than need should determine wages," and that "America should promote equal opportunity for all" rather than "equal outcomes." Overwhelming majorities from different occupational, racial, and political groups endorsed this ideology.

^34a949

- Most people accept that the outcomes of capitalism are generally fair. 

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=4&selection=152,0,186,42|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 4]] 

> l groups endorsed this ideology. To be sure, not everyone believes in the justness of capitalism or the American Dream. Hochschild herself notes that a subset of the population is estranged from it. Because desolation and apathy are unlikely to coexist with ambition and determination for success, it seems clear that differently situated poor people have different beliefs and aspirations. It may be that those who could organize for redistributive politics are insufficiently disaffected to do so, while those who are sufficiently disaffected are incapable of organizing.

- There are certainly those who do not endorse the "fairness" of capitalism, but they do not seem to be a strong enough force to promote redistributive politics. 

> Like empathy gulfs, what some psychologists call "framing effects" also shape what people see as pertinent political alternatives. Here the concern is not with the goods people might in principle, or on reflection, imagine themselves deciding to pursue, but rather with what they actually focus on when making a particular decision.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=5&selection=30,0,44,21|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 5]]

> Research shows that people often think largely in self-referential terms. Moreover, when they do compare them selves to others, it is generally to people who are situated like themselves. Workers do not compare themselves to their bosses in assessing their circumstances. They do not compare themselves to the rich, but rather to workers like them selves.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=5&selection=68,0,86,7|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 5]]

- People are more likely to compare their resources to themselves or others similarly situated at different times rather than to those in a different class. 

> For example, one reason workers might not press for redistribution stems from "backward-looking framing effects", a phrase meant to capture the reactive character of much human behavior. After all, the query "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" directs attention to the past - with the implication that the alternative to the present is not progress, but backsliding. Once a marginal advance has occurred, there is always the possibility of losing it. 

^0c525d

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=5&selection=108,0,128,35|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 5]]

- "Backwards-looking framing effects" frame alternatives to the current social and economic situation as the potential to backslide (rather than progress). 

> People who are surprised that there are not more demands for downward redistribution tend to work on the assumption that those near the bottom of the economic distribution think they have nothing to lose. This may be true for a handful of people, but certainly not for most - and definitely not for most modern-day workers. In many circum stances, voters may decide that things could well get worse - particularly if things 

^edd7eb

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=5&selection=132,0,154,7|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 5]]

- Proponents of the redistribution thesis often assume that workers have nothing to lose, but these seems untrue for most modern day workers. 

>What may be called inward-looking framing effects also shape the decisions that people routinely make. Rallying grassroots supporters for the Million Man March in October of 1995, Louis Farrakhan insisted that the time had come for the dispossessed in the black community to draw on their own resources and bootstrap themselves out of poverty. His message was unequivocal: forget the inequality out there and focus on yourself. When people internalize ideologies of this kind, they will not demand redistribution through public
>institutions. Instead they will blame themselves for their circumstances and accept that they should look inward when trying to improve them. Inward looking framing effects are likely significant in accounting for the dearth of redistributive demands in the United States, given the power of bootstrapping ideologies here. Whether the inward looking focus is on the self or on a comparatively dispossessed group, it is significantly not on the larger society and its distribution of goods and opportunities

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=5&selection=156,2,184,36|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 5]]

- Inward-looking framing effects cause people to blame themselves for their situation rather than society. (e.g "pick yourself up by the bootstrap" mentality)

> Even in the United States, economic issues must vie for attention with concerns about status and recognition. Part of the appeal of ethnic and other forms of identity politics in countries like ours comes from the persistence of status inequalities. By focusing on issues of status and dignity, social movements some times draw attention away from more purely economic concerns.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=6&selection=62,0,80,25|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 6]]

- Social movements can draw attention away from economic concerns. 

> Downward-looking framing effects draw attention away from redistribution in still another way: by directing attention to those less fortunate in the social order. The existence of the very poor can seem frightening to those just above them in the social order in at least three ways: they might be thought to threaten violence, they might be believed to be the cause of tax burdens to fund welfare demands, and the possibility of unemployment might conjure up the possibility of plunging into their ranks.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=6&selection=82,0,90,8|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 6

> Fear of the marauding rabble of dispossessed poor has existed for centuries. Rather than disappearing in capitalist democracies like the United States, this fear seems to have taken on a petit bourgeois form. Among those in the middle class and especially the lower middle class the fear takes the form of an antipathy toward those who are below them. There is even a tendency for those in the upper reaches of the lower class to dis tance themselves from the lower reaches, identifying instead with middle-class norms.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=6&selection=108,0,132,31|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 6]]

> Downward-looking framing effects are sustained by demonizing those at or near the bottom of the social order. Hatred of welfare stems from the per ception that most recipients are unde serving. Media portrayals of the very poor as disproportionately black and lazy reinforce this perception - as does the act of criminalizing the poor. The vast numbers of poor people who cur rently are housed in American prisons constitute a manifestly demonized group - even though the overwhelming majority of these prisoners have in fact committed no violent crime.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=7&selection=8,0,36,27|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 7]]

- "Downward-looking framing effects" frame the lower classes as being deserving of their circumstances and perhaps a threat to those above them, therefore reducing potential coalitions between the tiers of the lower and middle class by pitting them against each-other. 

> Finally, perceptions of political alter natives are often shaped by anecdotal distractions. In Albion s Fatal Tree, historian Douglas Hay tells the story of an eighteenth-century criminal law that operated almost exclusively in the interests of propertied elites, but by means of which even noblemen were occasion ally subjected to extreme forms of punishment - even the death penalty - for relatively minor offences against property. Hay argues that such token but spectacular punishments meted out to aristocrats were meant to instill awe for the legal order that protected the propertied classes. What better way to get the poor to think that the law is not the instrument of the rich than to have it so visibly enforced against a member of the nobility. 

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=7&selection=38,0,66,41|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 7]]

> Anecdotal distractions need not be directed only at the rich : lurid stories about "welfare queens" driving Cadillacs draw attention away from the law abiding behavior of most welfare recipients. Horatio Alger stories work in the same way, as Ronald Reagan well understood ("What I want to see above all is that this country remains a country where someone can always get rich"). When politicians visibly single out individuals who have moved from welfare to work or otherwise triumphed over adversity, they exhibit their understanding of the power of anecdotal distractions. The man in the street does not ask questions about random sampling or selecting on the dependent variable. 

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=7&selection=78,0,110,34|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 7]]

- Anecdotal distractions are able to misguide public perception.

> Proximity in shaping their aspirations. It also suggests that a perverse dynamic may be at work as well. If de jure segregation, such as the Group Areas Act that launched South Africa's residential seg regation in 1950, or the Jim Crow laws that prevailed in the southern United States until the 1960s, eventually provokes collective resistance, then simply removing the legal prohibitions may well destroy the will to act collectively - leaving defacto segregation unchanged. As long as they are free and equal under the law, individuals will generally aspire toward individual economic mobility - even if the odds of success are negligible. The contemporary United States provides anecdotal evidence in support of this contention, and so does post apartheid South Africa.

> This last point may recall Karl Marx's famous critique of the ways in which a democratic constitution formally committed to the rights of man and citizen may distort perceptions of injustice, and so blunt demands for social change. For Marx, democracy was an engine of false consciousness. But Marx suffered from his own form of false consciousness. His version of the redistributive thesis depended on a crude picture of a society increasingly polarized into two separate and highly unequal classes: a tiny ruling class, and a vast working class whose members were barely scraping by. A few from the middle classes might join the ruling class, but most others, he argued, would fall down into the proletariat as capitalism advanced. Part of Marx's failure here was conceptual. His theory of exploitation moves illicitly between the claim that the relative immiseration of the proletariat will increase (which follows analytically from his theory of exploitation) to the claim that their absolute immiseration will also increase (which does not follow). The rate of Marxian exploitation can increase while wages remain constant or even rise. Another part of Marx's failure was empirical. In all capitalist democracies, a relatively affluent middle class, far from disappearing, has flourished, in part by including many people Marx would have classified as workers : they must sell their labor power to others in order to survive, yet they live considerably above mere subsistence. Such people are unlikely to respond to Marx's famous battle cry that they have "nothing to lose but their chains"

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=9&selection=0,40,80,13|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 9]]

- Shapiro points out several flaws in Marx classic account of the redistribution thesis. One of the main flaws is the fact that modern democracies have a large middle class (mostly proletariats in the technical sense) that do not have "nothing to lose but their chains".

> In fact, a more complex class dynamic might be stable for reasons that are quite distinct from any of the considerations about reference groups, knowledge, beliefs, framing effects, and empathy and physical gulfs that I have already adduced. Even in a world of fully in formed self-interested rational actors, it is far from clear that a middle-class voter, though relatively disadvantaged compared to the rich, would support a policy of economic redistribution. Take the case of South Africa today. At the moment, there is not significant pressure for downward redistribution from the grassroots of the ruling African National Congress Party in South Africa - in part because of the extreme character of the economic inequality that currently prevails. An increase in taxes for even the top 20 percent of the population would entail an increase in taxes for much of the black working class - so they have self-interested reasons to oppose it. Even if they did support redistribution, it would scarcely be to those at the bottom of the economic order in a country where at least a third of the black population is unemployed. This confirms the importance of looking seriously into the counterintuitive possibility that the more unequal the distribution, the harder it may be to mobilize lower-middle- and working class support for redistribution down ward - certainly for redistribution to those at the bottom.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=9&selection=100,0,170,25|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 9]]

- Often it may not be in the interest of those in the middle class to support downward redistribution (especially redistribution to the bottom). 

> In one attempt to model the implications of this type of social situation, Fredrich Breyer and Heinrich W. Ursprung have shown formally that above-average income earners are in a position to bribe the small segment of voters whose incomes fall between the median and the mean to resist the temptation of confiscatory taxation. In another article, James M. Snyder and Gerald H. Kramer have argued that a majority of middle- and upper-income taxpayers might support a relatively progressive income tax - but only if it reduced their tax burden at the expense of the poor. The more wealth a tiny minority has, the easier it is to co-opt middle-class voters through marginal tax cuts, middle-class tax benefits such as home interest mortgage deductions, and subsidies for their children's higher education. The members of this middle group may well be more concerned about what they stand to lose from an aggressive system of progressive taxation than attracted to the uncertain benefits of allying with those below them in order to soak the rich.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=9&selection=174,0,186,37|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 9]]

- Wealthy minorities can bribe sections of the middle class to prevent coalitions which would organise for redistributive politics. 

> In any event, other factors have been involved as well. One such is doubtless "Buckley v. Valeo". This 1976 Supreme Court decision ushered in an era of limitless spending in political campaigns, loading the dice more heavily than before in favor of those with money. Particularly in an inquiry that aspires to be sensitive to the consequences of incomplete information, cognitive limitations, and framing effects, some attention to how and why issues are put in front of people is in order.

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=10&selection=126,0,148,7|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 10]]

- The supreme court case "Buckley v. Valeo" allowing limitless political campaign spending likely plays a major role in the regressive redistribution in america from the eighties onwards. 

> Another likely cause of the recent dearth of demands for downward redistribution derives from the changing beliefs of the elite. In the era from the New Deal through the Great Society, many American political and economic elites embraced a Keynesian worldview. Among its implications was the belief that capitalism could conceivably fall apart, and that spending by government to stimulate demand at the bottom of the economy was needed to stave off this possibility. That fear is much less prevalent among elites today. There is, moreover, no longer a threatening alter native system on offer from the Soviet Union, eliminating a very good ulterior motive for the haves to worry about the have-nots. The potential of these developments to reinforce empathy gulfs and downward-lo

[[why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich.pdf#page=10&selection=152,1,166,37|why_the_poor_dont_soak_the_rich, page 10]]

- At the time of this article the American (political) elite had moved from a Keynesian consensus on economics (that capitalist economies might fail) to a Neo-liberal consensus on economics (of course this article is in 2002 before the 2008 crisis). Furthermore the fall of the soviet union meant that there didn't seem to be an alternative to compete with.

- Re [[#^e68fcc]]: To add to this point, if instead they were cleaning middle class houses perhaps that would be something they could aspire to own one day (and perhaps they could request some reasonable government assistance to help achieve this goal). 

- Re[[#^34a949]]: Of course many sociologists would argue that this is a product of capitalism "reproducing" its ideology. I also wonder how much different the results of this study would be now (I assume that most people still generally accept this idea but that the confidence and magnitude are a lot lower). 

- Re [[#^a2727d]]: The description as "incapable" seems a bit unfair to me but perhaps this is fitting with some of the current twitter activist discourse (for example the "door dash" discourse). 

- Re [[#^0c525d]]: This seems related to the jeopardy thesis in [[The Rhetoric of Reaction - Albert Hirschman]].

- Re [[#^edd7eb]]: This is also addressed in [[Political Man - Seymour Martin Lipset#^c64285|Political Man]] with the hilarious line about [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] transposing [[Karl Marx]]'s analysis before Marx even wrote it. 

- Re [[#^945bf0]]: Although then I stilll wonder how communist revolutions occurred. Is the idea that in the societies where they occured there was de jure class divides and once they become de facto (in capitalist democracies) the will for collective action goes away?
