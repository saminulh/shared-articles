I would love sources for this lol.

What evidence is there for necessity? High birth rate countries don’t have government support I’d imagine (like Nigeria)

> [!quote]
> the very lofty cultural expectations of what it means to parent, quote, unquote, well today.

Sweden’s policies are pro-work and pro-gender equality rather than pro-natalist. Try to enable independence and self-sufficiency.

> [!quote]
> policy just isn’t really effective, at least at any of the margins anyone has been able to try, if what you want to do is increase the birthrate.

Eg, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.

Wild!

Older mother shocked at how much she takes the child places lmao.

> And then all of a sudden, you have children. And the demand is to first shift a tremendous amount of that self-identity to your parenting, to your family. But also there’s just, I think, at some level, you can only be so good a parent and a worker at the same time.

> [!quote]
> most U.S. parents lack the time and resources to access the wonderful parts of parenthood. And to me, that is the devastating consequence of this lack of public policy support for parents, and this is why it looks very different in other countries.

> a way in which digital media and social media and everything else has created, across a lot of domains, a preference for highly negative conversations. Everything in politics is terrible. Parenting is terrible. I’m super anxious. We’re seeing a big teen mental health crisis.
