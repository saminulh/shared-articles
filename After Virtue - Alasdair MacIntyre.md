Just planning on the Shapiro notes at the moment, will see how things feel.

## Prologue

> [!quote]
> I became a Thomist after writing _After Virtue_ in part because I became convinced that Aquinas was in some respects a better Aristotelian than Aristotle, that not only was he an excellent interpreter of Aristotle’s texts, but that he had been able to extend and deepen both Aristotle’s metaphysical and his moral enquiries.

Seems intriguing, though I don’t know what it means lmao.

> [!quote]
> So it is possible for one such tradition to defeat another in respect of the adequacy of its claims to truth and to rational justification, even though there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which _any_ rational agent whatsoever could determine which tradition is superior to which.
> 
> Yet, just because are no such neutral standards, the protagonists of a defeated tradition may not recognize, and may not be able to recognize, that such a defeat has occurred.

His rejection of relativism. Even if in principle one tradition dominates another tradition, the losers can’t recognize it by virtue of being stuck in the loser tradition worldview.

Uhh

> [!quote]
> My own critique of liberalism derives from a judgment that the best type of human life, that in which the tradition of the virtues is most adequately embodied, is lived by those engaged in constructing and sustaining forms of community directed towards the shared achievement of those common goods without which the ultimate human good cannot be achieved.

> [!quote]
> When recurrently the tradition of the virtues is regenerated, it is always in everyday life, it is always through the engagement by plain persons in a variety of practices, including those of making and sustaining families and households, schools, clinics, and local forms of political community. And that regeneration enables such plain persons to put to the question the dominant modes of moral and social discourse and the institutions that find their expression in those modes.

## Chapter 1

The analogy we start with here is really fun to think about and pretty wild, but I feel like this misrepresents and doesn’t give enough credit to science. I can believe the proliferation of cult-like interpretations and subjectivist theories, but I’d imagine that unless the post-science societies never re-discover the scientific method, all of these various theories would intermingle, with some being falsified and some being folded into the scientific consensus—ultimately, you’ll end up in a similar position as we are now. If we are imagining a scenario where they do not/cannot employ the scientific method to resolve the manifold theories, then to me, they would cease to be “theories of science.” This seems important to mention because the intent of this analogy is to draw a parallel to moral theories, but the mechanism of the scientific method is fundamental to science and its successes and I can’t think of an analog to this for morality.

> [!quote]
> The hypothesis which I wish to advance is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described. What we possess, if this view is true, are the fragments of a conceptual scheme, parts which now lack those contexts from which their significance derived. We possess indeed simulacra of morality, we continue to use many of the key expressions. But we have—very largely, if not entirely—lost our comprehension, both theoretical and practical, or morality.

At the moment, I’m skeptical of the idea that everyone’s moral frameworks are different fragments of a broader unified moral framework, and even if such a framework could exist. In the science analogy, such a unified framework necessarily exists by construction, but coming from my “naturalist” tendencies (i.e., believing our moral intuitions come from evolutionary and social processes), I have no reason to believe that our moral intuitions come from a broader, internally consistent, moral framework.

The two things we know about his hypothesis: i) analytical and phenomenological philosophy will not help in resolving the grave disorder of language and ii) the history will be demonstrated as order -> fall -> damaged restoration.

The philosophy of language seems to feature heavily so far (the primary focus, even). I know basically nothing about this, so it will be interesting going forward lol. This language focus makes sense with respect to the Shapiro story about Crossfire debates, but I wonder how we will get to talking about the community-oriented stuff.

## Chapter 2

> [!quote]
> There seems to be no rational way of securing moral agreement in our culture.

In which culture is this not the case? What makes a way of securing moral agreement rational or not, and perhaps more importantly, what bearing does that have on “correctness”? Is a dictator commanding a moral code onto their populace “rational,” and if it is, why should I care?

The three elements to modern moral debates:
1. Conceptual incommensurability of the rival arguments. Every side has a logically valid argument and their disagreements stem from opposing premises. Once the argument reaches this point, no more progress can be made with because there is no evaluative framework for deciding between premises and it all just devolves into assertions and counter-assertions. This also applies to when an individual personally decides upon a position. As such, a person presumably lacks good reason for the position they hold and there is at least an ”appearance of a disquieting moral arbitrariness” to one’s own position.
2. Purported impersonality and rationality. These arguments presuppose an impersonal (i.e., independent of those involved in the argument) criteria for evaluating actions.
3. Wide variety of historical origins for the different arguments. The moral pluralism this represents is to him (as will be argued later) an “unharmonious melange of ill-assorted fragments” rather than an “ordered dialogue of intersecting viewpoints.”
> 	all those various concepts which inform our moral discourse were originally at home in larger totalities of theory and practice in which they enjoyed a role and function supplied by contexts of which they have now been deprived. Moreover the concepts we employ have in at least some cases changed

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=30&selection=32,55,44,67|after-virtue, page 30]]

The first two elements above interact to yield our interminable debates: while at base our positions are all in a sense arbitrary, the seeming objectivity of the arguments means that it seems these debates can be resolved rationally.

>  We \[Philosophers\] all too often still treat the moral philosophers of the past as contributors to a single debate with a relatively unvarying subject-matter.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=31&selection=39,46,41,36|after-virtue, page 31]]

C.L. Stevenson is the “most important exponent” of emotivism. Emotivism fails for three reasons:
1. Proponents of the theory avoid the necessary step of identification and characterization of the actual feelings or attitudes that are evoked with a moral claim. A circular argument: “identifying the relevant kind of approval as moral approval—that is, the type of approval expressed by a specifically moral judgment —becomes vacuously circular.”
	- I don’t see how this is a problem, or at least how every subjective take doesn’t suffer this: Ice cream flavour preferences are an expression of feelings or attitudes of approval. What kind of feeling or attitude of approval? Approval (or disapproval) of ice cream flavours—that is, the type of approval expressed by a specifically ice cream flavour-related preference.
2. Emotivism tries to characterize as equivalent two fundamentally different types of expressions. Statements of preference are personal and their force depends on the context of the speaker and the listener, while moral statements are independent of that.
	- Emotivists, I presume, aren’t trying to make impersonal moral statements as they believe in the inherent subjectivity at the root of such claims. As for everyone else doing so, I would probably argue that their moral statements are actually dependent on personal context, even if the speakers intend a universal quality to their argument. I don’t have a great response to the fact that people feel the need to universalize their moral arguments, except that people do also try to argue about personal preferences in objective ways (though of course less forcefully).
	- Thinking on this more, this need for universality might stem from a general fear of moral subjectivity and (as a corollary) a belief in some objective morality. Under such an assumption, of course one does not imagine themselves to be an immoral agent and so will argue their moral beliefs as objectively true. If this is true, I wonder where this comes from? Maybe the Enlightenment somehow induces us to think this way, but it could also be a relic of religion, where by definition there is an objective morality.
3. The feeling or attitude of an expression lies not only in its meaning. Argues that emotivism was born as a counter to “intuitionism”
	- “…it might be plausibly claimed, if the evidence was adequate, that in using such sentences to say whatever they mean, the agent was in fact doing nothing other than expressing his feelings or attitudes and attempting to influence the feelings and attitudes of others” ([[after-virtue.pdf#page=34&selection=1,6,11,46|after-virtue, page 34]]). Related to my previous point.
	- “Emotivism on this account turns out to be an empirical thesis“ ([[after-virtue.pdf#page=38&selection=34,9,34,70|after-virtue, page 38]]) and “Emotivism thus understood turns out to be, as a cogent theory of use rather than a false theory of meaning, connected with one specific stage in moral development or decline, a stage which our own culture entered early in the present century.” ([[after-virtue.pdf#page=38&selection=62,23,67,45|after-virtue, page 38]]) I think I agree with the first quote and the first part of the second quote, I would probably believe it applies to a larger scope than MacIntyre claims lol.

>  What emotivism however did fail to reckon with is the difference that it would make to morality if emotivism were not only true but also widely believed to be true.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=39&selection=52,25,54,41|after-virtue, page 39]]

> The terminus of justification is thus always, on this view, a not further to be justified choice, a choice unguided by criteria. Each individual implicitly or explicitly has to adopt his or her own first principles on the basis of such a choice.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=40&selection=58,0,61,17|after-virtue, page 40]]

And so emotivism returns.

Analytic philosophy counters to emotivism (e.g., by Rawls) fail (as to be seen later). I believe Shapiro mentioned that mature Rawls ended up in a subjective state with his veil of ignorance (related to the idea that coalitions don’t need to agree on the reasons to agree on the policy)? ^9c0a5c

MacIntyre sets out for himself two tasks: 1) showing the existence of a past authoritative and objective moral system and 2) that we are currently an emotivist culture, if not self-conciously, then in practice.
* If 1) fails to materialize, then it seems like MacIntyre is stuck as an emotivist. My prior is that 1) will be hard to prove and will likely be unconvincing TBH.

## Chapter 3

Every moral philosophy presupposes a sociology.

> emotivism entails the obliteration of any genuine distinction between manipulative and non-manipulative social relations

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=43&selection=37,0,52,50|after-virtue, page 43]]

Kantian ethics would say that in relationships uninformed by morality, one only treats the other as a means to their own ends, while when informed by morality, they treat the other as an end unto itself. In terms of moral persuasion, a non-moral relationship would permit the use of any sorts of persuasion and influence to cause the other to think a certain way. On the other hand, for moral relationships, you try to influence the other by reasons they perceive as good and appeal to impersonal criteria of validity.
* Why are reasons the other perceives as good and impersonal rational criteria conflated? They seem logically independent to me. In particular, why is rationality necessary for me to be considering an other as end? I guess I’m unclear so far if MacIntyre is endorsing this per se, but it feels like a pretty Enlightenment position (which I suppose makes sense given Kant).

This distinction above is illusory to the emotivist, as all utterances are ultimately expressions of feeling, which are not impersonal criteria.

> The sole reality of distinctively moral discourse is the attempt of one will to align the attitudes, feelings, preference and choices of another with its own. Others are always means, never ends.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=44&selection=13,44,20,29|after-virtue, page 44]]

This dichotomy, to me, feels more like a consequence of the definition of (treating others as) means versus ends.

> The unifying preoccupation of that tradition \[of *The Portrait of a Lady*, *La Neveu de Rameau*, and *Enten-Eller*\] is the condition of those who see in the social world nothing but a meeting place for individual wills, each with its own set of attitudes and preferences and who understand that world solely as an arena for the achievement of their own satisfaction, who interpret reality as a series of opportunities for their enjoyment and for whom the last enemy is boredom.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=45&selection=17,0,23,26|after-virtue, page 45]]

I feel like we are conflating so much stuff to be able to connect this all to (different realizations of) emotivism and its social consequences.

Weber’s conception of contemporary bureaucratic rationality:
> Bureaucratic rationality is the rationality of matching means to ends economically and efficiently…. Questions of ends are questions of values, and on values reason is silent; conflict between rival values cannot be rationally settled. Instead one must simply choose

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=45&selection=88,49,89,71|after-virtue, page 45]]

> Weber of course took himself to be distinguishing power from authority, precisely because authority serves ends, serves faiths. But, as Philip Rieff has acutely noted, 'Weber's ends, the causes there to be served, are means of acting; they cannot escape service to power' (Rieff 1975, p. 22). For on Weber's view no type of authority can appeal to rational criteria to vindicate itself except that type of bureaucratic authority which appeals precisely to its own *effectiveness*.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=46&selection=43,35,58,66|after-virtue, page 46]]

But isn’t effectiveness ultimately an appeal to ends, e.g., a government claiming that it has reduced poverty by X%? Maybe “reducing poverty” itself should not be understood as an end but as a mean (I guess as the formerly-poor person now has more means to do with what they will).


A *character* is a culturally recognizable symbol representing a certain type of person along with constraints on their behaviour (especially morally).

>  In the case of a character role and personality fuse in a more specific way than in general; in the case of a character the possibilities of action are defined in a more limited way than in general

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=48&selection=9,10,19,56|after-virtue, page 48]]

> For all intentions presuppose more or less complex, more or less coherent, more or less explicit bodies of belief, sometimes of moral belief

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=48&selection=81,25,83,12|after-virtue, page 48]]

Hmm, coherence and explicitness seem a bit suspect to me.

Characters in emotivism:
1. Rich aesthete: bored and turns to manipulating others for their own amusement (excess means trying to find ends)
2. Bureaucratic manager: manipulates subordinates so that the organization may meet its goals (given ends and modifies means to fit the ends)
3. Therapist: “treats ends as given, as outside his scope; his concern also is with technique, with effectiveness in transforming neurotic symptoms into directed energy, maladjusted individuals into well-adjusted ones.”

> Philip Rieff has documented with devastating insight a number of the ways in which truth has been displaced as a value and replaced by psychological effectiveness.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=50&selection=126,7,130,5|after-virtue, page 50]]

> Those who persistently attack bureaucracy effectively reinforce the notion that it is in terms of a relationship to bureaucracy that the self has to define itself

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=51&selection=39,20,41,29|after-virtue, page 51]]

> \[In emotivism,\] The contrast between this democratization of moral agency and the elitist monopolies of managerial and therapeutic expertise could not be sharper.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=52&selection=18,56,20,58|after-virtue, page 52]]

>  Sartre…has depicted the self as entirely distinct from any particular social role which it may happen to assume; Erving Goffman by contrast has liquidated the self into its role-playing, arguing that the self is no more than 'a peg' on which the clothes of the role are hung (Goffman 1959, p. 253). 

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=52&selection=61,38,68,15|after-virtue, page 52]]

> For one way of re-envisaging the emotivist self is as having suffered a deprivation, a stripping away of qualities that were once believed to belong to the self. The self is now thought of as lacking any necessary social identity, because the kind of social identity that it once enjoyed is no longer available; the self is now thought of as criterionless, because the kind of telos in terms of which it once judged and acted is no longer thought to be credible. What kind of identity and what kind of telos were they?

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=53&selection=71,29,85,10|after-virtue, page 53]]

> In many pre-modern, traditional societies it is through his or her membership in a variety of social groups that the individual identifies himself or herself and is identified by others

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=53&selection=86,0,118,46|after-virtue, page 53]]

Isn’t this close-ish to the Goffman view (assuming identity=self)?

> To know oneself as such a social person is however not to occupy a static and fixed position. It is to find oneself placed at a certain point on a journey with set goals; to move through life is to make progress—or to fail to make progress —toward a given end. Thus a com- pleted and fulfilled life is an achievement and death is the point at which someone can be judged happy or unhappy. Hence the ancient Greek pro- verb: 'Call no man happy until he is dead.’

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=54&selection=23,24,29,42|after-virtue, page 54]]

> The bifurcation of the contemporary social world into a realm of the organizational in which ends are taken to be given and are not available for rational scrutiny and a realm of the personal in which judgment and debate about values are central factors, but in which no rational social resolution of issues is available, finds its internalization, its inner represen- tation in the relation of the individual self to the roles and characters of social life.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=54&selection=64,0,88,12|after-virtue, page 54]]

> But in fact what is crucial is that on which the contending parties \[of modern political debates\] agree, namely that there are only two alternative modes of social life open to us, one in which the free and arbitrary choices of individuals are sovereign and one in which the bureaucracy is sovereign, precisely so that it may limit the free and arbitrary choices of individuals.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=55&selection=1,45,14,23|after-virtue, page 55]]


## Chapter 4

> What I am going to suggest is that the key episodes in the social history which transformed, fragmented and, if my extreme view is correct, largely displaced morality…were episodes in the history of philosophy

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=56&selection=12,0,32,36|after-virtue, page 56]]

> But for intellectual variety as well as intellectual range not even the Germans can outmatch David Hume, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, Lord Kames and Lord Monboddo.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=57&selection=40,40,57,9|after-virtue, page 57]]

The Scottish are OP (maybe some ironic self-congratulation by MacIntyre)

We view the 18th century enlightenment as a French cultural moment, but it was a unified strain all over Europe (e.g., Scotland, Germany, England) and France was in many ways backwards. They particularly failed because they lacked:
1. Secularized protestant background
2. Educated class linking the public servants, clergy, and lay thinkers
	* The French intelligentsia were educated and alienated whereas the others were social
	* Nothing else would exist like them until the 19th century Russian intelligentsia (side note: the similarities of French and Russian centralization/totalitarianism/authoritarianism as opposed to the rest of Europe is something I’ve come across before and seems really interesting—especially with how differently they have manifested in the modern day).
3. University-like institutions.
I wonder how we should think of and contextualize Rousseau and [[The Social Contract - Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in the broader Enlightenment sphere, MacIntyre’s claims suggest he may something of an outlier.

This culture is primarily northern European. It was also musical(!)

> the relationship of our beliefs to sentences that we only or primarily sing, let alone to the music which accompanies those sentences, is not at all the same as the relationship of our beliefs to the sentences that we primarily say and say in an assertive mode.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=57&selection=117,33,128,65|after-virtue, page 57]]

The musicalization of sacred texts breaks the traditional links those texts had with beliefs (not totally). This blurs a traditional distinction between religious and aesthetic. This changes the modes of beliefs and also there starts to arise questions about justification of belief.

> Yet this concept of authority as excluding reason is, as I have already noticed, itself a peculiarly, even if not exclusively, modem concept, fashioned in a culture to which the notion of authority is alien and repug- nant, so that appeals to authority appear irrational.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=62&selection=58,16,61,53|after-virtue, page 62]]
#### The word “moral”

>  Cicero invented 'moralis' to translate the Greek word in the De Fato—means 'pertaining to character' where a man's character is nothing other than his set dispositions to behave systematically in one way rather than another, to lead one particular kind of life.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=58&selection=53,11,61,68|after-virtue, page 58]]

* The English word “moral” has no Latin equivalent and the word it comes from simply means the character (i.e., set of behavioural dispositions) of a person. So “the moral” of a story is just the practical lessons it teaches, there is no normative implications with this understanding of the word.
* The use of the word probably started out with the expression “moral virtue” and then the latter part was later dropped. The meaning of it narrowed in use until the late 17th century when it came to mean “not sexually lax”.
* “Morality” was used initially to refer to the rules of conduct for affairs that not theological, legal, nor aesthetic. This eventually led people to want to find independent rational justification for it.
	* Kierkegaard’s Enten-Eller killed this line of inquiry
	* [[after-virtue.pdf#page=63&selection=49,12,66,9|”It is perhaps this combination of novelty and tradition which accounts for the incoherence at the heart of Kierkegaard's position. It is certainly, so I shall argue, just this deeply incoherent combination of the novel and the inherited which is the logical outcome of the Enlighten- ment's project to provide a rational foundation for and justification of morality.”]]

#### Kant’s moral philosophy

Two theses:
1. All rational beings must share the same rational moral rules
2. If moral rules are binding on rational beings, then the contingent ability is unimportant and all that matters is the will

Kant of course believed that the universal maxims which would survive the rational tests would be those virtues he espoused and was taught from his own virtuous parents. In this way, Kant’s morality had an inherent conservatism to it.

As for the tests of a maxim, he rejects the test that obedience lead to happiness because happiness is too vague and makes moral action conditional on emotion and desires. He also rejects doing that which is commanded by God because this would require being able to judge God’s deeds and words.

The test he arrives at is practical reasons: a rational morality can be help by all men in all circumstances and be consistently applied. This is pretty bad and his arguments for it kind of suck.

> he believed that his formulations of the categorical imperative in terms of universalizability were equivalent to a quite different formulation: 'Always act so as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of others, as an end, and not as a means.'

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=66&selection=32,57,36,20|after-virtue, page 66]]

What it means to treat someone as end versus a mean:
> I may propose a course of action to someone either by offering him reasons for so acting or by trying to influence him in non-rational ways. If I do the former I treat him as a rational will, worthy of the same respect as is due to myself, for in offering him reasons I offer him an impersonal consideration for him to evaluate. What makes a reason a good reason has nothing to do with who utters it on a given occasion; and until an agent has decided for himself whether a reason is a good reason or not, he has no reason to act. By con- trast an attempt at non-rational suasion embodies an attempt to make the agent a mere instrument of my will, without any regard for bis rationality.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=66&selection=41,51,58,12|after-virtue, page 66]]

> But Kant gives us no good reason for holding this position

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=66&selection=64,14,65,32|after-virtue, page 66]]

> Kant's appeal to reason was the historical heir and successor of Diderot's and Hume's appeals to desire and to the passions. 

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=67&selection=9,47,13,14|after-virtue, page 67]]

#### Diderot and Hume

Both moral conservatives and thought themselves philosophical radicals. Diderot and Hume based their moral foundations on desire and passion (which is what Kant responded to with his reason-based foundation).

Diderot believes
> if in modern France we all pursue our desires with an enlightened eye to the long-run we shall see that the conservative moral rules are by and large the rules which the appeal to their basis in desire and passion will vindicate

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=67&selection=73,21,76,26|after-virtue, page 67]]

But this process requires deciding which desires are legitimate and which aren’t, and this can’t be done on the basis of desire itself. He attempts to distinguish between natural desires and those corrupted through civilization.

Hume:
> Like Diderot, he understands particular moral judg- ments as expressions of feeling, of the passions, for it is the passions and not reason which move us to action. But he also, like Diderot, recognizes that in judging morally we invoke general rules and he aspires to explain these by showing their utility in helping us to attain those ends which the passions set before us

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=68&selection=113,0,124,22|after-virtue, page 68]]

For Hume, morality can only be *either* a work of reason *or* a work of passion, and he ruled out reason. This negative argumentation is present in Kant and Kirkegaard as well. Taking all these negative arguments together, we are left with no possible foundations anymore.

Thus, first morality was divorced from the realm of religion through secularization and then philosophy failed to provide a common public justification and foundation for morality. This simultaneously caused philosophy to lose its central cultural role.
