Just planning on the Shapiro notes at the moment, will see how things feel.

## Prologue

> [!quote]
> I became a Thomist after writing _After Virtue_ in part because I became convinced that Aquinas was in some respects a better Aristotelian than Aristotle, that not only was he an excellent interpreter of Aristotle’s texts, but that he had been able to extend and deepen both Aristotle’s metaphysical and his moral enquiries.

Seems intriguing, though I don’t know what it means lmao.

> [!quote]
> So it is possible for one such tradition to defeat another in respect of the adequacy of its claims to truth and to rational justification, even though there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which _any_ rational agent whatsoever could determine which tradition is superior to which.
> 
> Yet, just because are no such neutral standards, the protagonists of a defeated tradition may not recognize, and may not be able to recognize, that such a defeat has occurred.

His rejection of relativism. Even if in principle one tradition dominates another tradition, the losers can’t recognize it by virtue of being stuck in the loser tradition worldview.

Uhh

> [!quote]
> My own critique of liberalism derives from a judgment that the best type of human life, that in which the tradition of the virtues is most adequately embodied, is lived by those engaged in constructing and sustaining forms of community directed towards the shared achievement of those common goods without which the ultimate human good cannot be achieved.

> [!quote]
> When recurrently the tradition of the virtues is regenerated, it is always in everyday life, it is always through the engagement by plain persons in a variety of practices, including those of making and sustaining families and households, schools, clinics, and local forms of political community. And that regeneration enables such plain persons to put to the question the dominant modes of moral and social discourse and the institutions that find their expression in those modes.

## Chapter 1

The analogy we start with here is really fun to think about and pretty wild, but I feel like this misrepresents and doesn’t give enough credit to science. I can believe the proliferation of cult-like interpretations and subjectivist theories, but I’d imagine that unless the post-science societies never re-discover the scientific method, all of these various theories would intermingle, with some being falsified and some being folded into the scientific consensus—ultimately, you’ll end up in a similar position as we are now. If we are imagining a scenario where they do not/cannot employ the scientific method to resolve the manifold theories, then to me, they would cease to be “theories of science.” This seems important to mention because the intent of this analogy is to draw a parallel to moral theories, but the mechanism of the scientific method is fundamental to science and its successes and I can’t think of an analog to this for morality.

> [!quote]
> The hypothesis which I wish to advance is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described. What we possess, if this view is true, are the fragments of a conceptual scheme, parts which now lack those contexts from which their significance derived. We possess indeed simulacra of morality, we continue to use many of the key expressions. But we have—very largely, if not entirely—lost our comprehension, both theoretical and practical, or morality.

At the moment, I’m skeptical of the idea that everyone’s moral frameworks are different fragments of a broader unified moral framework, and even if such a framework could exist. In the science analogy, such a unified framework necessarily exists by construction, but coming from my “naturalist” tendencies (i.e., believing our moral intuitions come from evolutionary and social processes), I have no reason to believe that our moral intuitions come from a broader, internally consistent, moral framework.

The two things we know about his hypothesis: i) analytical and phenomenological philosophy will not help in resolving the grave disorder of language and ii) the history will be demonstrated as order -> fall -> damaged restoration.

The philosophy of language seems to feature heavily so far (the primary focus, even). I know basically nothing about this, so it will be interesting going forward lol. This language focus makes sense with respect to the Shapiro story about Crossfire debates, but I wonder how we will get to talking about the community-oriented stuff.

## Chapter 2

> [!quote]
> There seems to be no rational way of securing moral agreement in our culture.

In which culture is this not the case? What makes a way of securing moral agreement rational or not, and perhaps more importantly, what bearing does that have on “correctness”? Is a dictator commanding a moral code onto their populace “rational,” and if it is, why should I care?

The three elements to modern moral debates:
1. Conceptual incommensurability of the rival arguments. Every side has a logically valid argument and their disagreements stem from opposing premises. Once the argument reaches this point, no more progress can be made with because there is no evaluative framework for deciding between premises and it all just devolves into assertions and counter-assertions. This also applies to when an individual personally decides upon a position. As such, a person presumably lacks good reason for the position they hold and there is at least an ”appearance of a disquieting moral arbitrariness” to one’s own position.
2. Purported impersonality and rationality. These arguments presuppose an impersonal (i.e., independent of those involved in the argument) criteria for evaluating actions.
3. Wide variety of historical origins for the different arguments. The moral pluralism this represents is to him (as will be argued later) an “unharmonious melange of ill-assorted fragments” rather than an “ordered dialogue of intersecting viewpoints.”
> 	all those various concepts which inform our moral discourse were originally at home in larger totalities of theory and practice in which they enjoyed a role and function supplied by contexts of which they have now been deprived. Moreover the concepts we employ have in at least some cases changed

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=30&selection=32,55,44,67|after-virtue, page 30]]

The first two elements above interact to yield our interminable debates: while at base our positions are all in a sense arbitrary, the seeming objectivity of the arguments means that it seems these debates can be resolved rationally.

>  We \[Philosophers\] all too often still treat the moral philosophers of the past as contributors to a single debate with a relatively unvarying subject-matter.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=31&selection=39,46,41,36|after-virtue, page 31]]

C.L. Stevenson is the “most important exponent” of emotivism. Emotivism fails for three reasons:
1. Proponents of the theory avoid the necessary step of identification and characterization of the actual feelings or attitudes that are evoked with a moral claim. A circular argument: “identifying the relevant kind of approval as moral approval—that is, the type of approval expressed by a specifically moral judgment —becomes vacuously circular.”
	- I don’t see how this is a problem, or at least how every subjective take doesn’t suffer this: Ice cream flavour preferences are an expression of feelings or attitudes of approval. What kind of feeling or attitude of approval? Approval (or disapproval) of ice cream flavours—that is, the type of approval expressed by a specifically ice cream flavour-related preference.
2. Emotivism tries to characterize as equivalent two fundamentally different types of expressions. Statements of preference are personal and their force depends on the context of the speaker and the listener, while moral statements are independent of that.
	- Emotivists, I presume, aren’t trying to make impersonal moral statements as they believe in the inherent subjectivity at the root of such claims. As for everyone else doing so, I would probably argue that their moral statements are actually dependent on personal context, even if the speakers intend a universal quality to their argument. I don’t have a great response to the fact that people feel the need to universalize their moral arguments, except that people do also try to argue about personal preferences in objective ways (though of course less forcefully).
	- Thinking on this more, this need for universality might stem from a general fear of moral subjectivity and (as a corollary) a belief in some objective morality. Under such an assumption, of course one does not imagine themselves to be an immoral agent and so will argue their moral beliefs as objectively true. If this is true, I wonder where this comes from? Maybe the Enlightenment somehow induces us to think this way, but it could also be a relic of religion, where by definition there is an objective morality.
3. The feeling or attitude of an expression lies not only in its meaning. Argues that emotivism was born as a counter to “intuitionism”
	- “…it might be plausibly claimed, if the evidence was adequate, that in using such sentences to say whatever they mean, the agent was in fact doing nothing other than expressing his feelings or attitudes and attempting to influence the feelings and attitudes of others” ([[after-virtue.pdf#page=34&selection=1,6,11,46|after-virtue, page 34]]). Related to my previous point.
	- “Emotivism on this account turns out to be an empirical thesis“ ([[after-virtue.pdf#page=38&selection=34,9,34,70|after-virtue, page 38]]) and “Emotivism thus understood turns out to be, as a cogent theory of use rather than a false theory of meaning, connected with one specific stage in moral development or decline, a stage which our own culture entered early in the present century.” ([[after-virtue.pdf#page=38&selection=62,23,67,45|after-virtue, page 38]]) I think I agree with the first quote and the first part of the second quote, I would probably believe it applies to a larger scope than MacIntyre claims lol.

>  What emotivism however did fail to reckon with is the difference that it would make to morality if emotivism were not only true but also widely believed to be true.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=39&selection=52,25,54,41|after-virtue, page 39]]

> The terminus of justification is thus always, on this view, a not further to be justified choice, a choice unguided by criteria. Each individual implicitly or explicitly has to adopt his or her own first principles on the basis of such a choice.

[[after-virtue.pdf#page=40&selection=58,0,61,17|after-virtue, page 40]]

And so emotivism returns.

Analytic philosophy counters to emotivism (e.g., by Rawls) fail (as to be seen later). I believe Shapiro mentioned that mature Rawls ended up in a subjective state with his veil of ignorance (related to the idea that coalitions don’t need to agree on the reasons to agree on the policy)? ^9c0a5c

MacIntyre sets out for himself two tasks: 1) showing the existence of a past authoritative and objective moral system and 2) that we are currently an emotivist culture, if not self-conciously, then in practice.
* If 1) fails to materialize, then it seems like MacIntyre is stuck as an emotivist. My prior is that 1) will be hard to prove and will likely be unconvincing TBH.
