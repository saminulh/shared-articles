How?

> Hence, with bipartisan support and cheerleading from the corporate world and mainstream media, Washington forged free trade agreements with China and Vietnam. e results have been disastrous. In the roughly two decades that followed these agreements, more than 40,000 factories in the U.S. shut down, around two million workers lost their jobs, and working-class Americans experienced wage stagnation—even while corporations made billions and investors were richly rewarded. Beyond the damage done at home, these agreements also contained few standards to protect workers or the environment, leading to disastrous impacts overseas. Resentment of these trade policies among working-class Americans helped fuel Trump’s initial rise and continues to benet him today.

## Thoughts

To me this article feels like it lacks substance. It gives very rudimentary descriptions of foreign policy issues, very simple analysis, and very vague or idealistic solutions. It makes me question Bernie Sanders as a politician, but perhaps it is still good for the nation for someone to play his "roll" in politics.
