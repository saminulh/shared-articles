## Reading Notes

The consistent bipartisanship in foreign policy is pretty interesting and I’m not totally sure why this happens. Maybe foreign policy is kind of independent of the left-right spectrum (idea being that people by and large don’t care about foreign policy in their voting decision) and maybe this opens the door for other institutions (e.g., think tanks) to influence foreign policy across party lines.

 [[#^594627|Re “I wonder how true this is”:]]  Yea, my main question is how much of this was a consequence of free trade vs. technology. I think some of the books Shapiro mentioned could go more in detail about the sorts of demographics that started voting for Trump. Also related to Shapiro, I remember one of the lectures had something to do with unions and businesses trying to come to an agreement around the Kennedy era that had some protectionist elements to it, I wonder how that is related to free trade stuff (obviously the global labour market demographics were very different then).

> That is why the United States must address the moral and economic outrage of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, in which the richest one percent of the planet owns more wealth than the bottom 99 percent—an inequality that allows some people to own dozens of homes, private airplanes, and even entire islands, while millions of children go hungry or die of easily prevented diseases.

This is a sneaky framing of global inequality LOL. According to [this](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/15/23874111/charity-philanthropy-americans-global-rich), the global 1% is making $60k a year after tax, a far cry from owning dozens of homes and private airplanes.

[[#^6a7110|Re “I think this is the most…”]]: I wonder if the US had the political will to do so (i.e., not captured by special interests), would this be “easy” for them to impose on the rest of the world? My sense is yes, but I’m not sure.

> These agreements must be negotiated with input from workers, the American people, and the U.S. Congress—rather than just lobbyists from large multinational corporations, who currently dominate the trade negotiation process.

I would guess that the American people will fall more on the side of multinationals than the global worker TBH. With no national sense of solidarity and faced with the consequence of increased prices, I don’t see them advocating against their interests on behalf of poor sweatshop workers.

> The United States must also cut excess military spending and demand that other countries do the same.

How?

## Thoughts

I agree with you, the article just kind of felt like moralizing without any content about doing anything in practice. I never thought of Sanders as particularly interested in or thoughtful on foreign policy, so it makes sense he doesn’t have much insight here. He seems to view this entirely in the lens of corporations vs. people, so it almost feels Marxist (in the “Workers of the world, unite!” class solidarity sort of way), while minimizing other states and their interests. Maybe I’m reaching a bit here LMAO.

How?

> Hence, with bipartisan support and cheerleading from the corporate world and mainstream media, Washington forged free trade agreements with China and Vietnam. e results have been disastrous. In the roughly two decades that followed these agreements, more than 40,000 factories in the U.S. shut down, around two million workers lost their jobs, and working-class Americans experienced wage stagnation—even while corporations made billions and investors were richly rewarded. Beyond the damage done at home, these agreements also contained few standards to protect workers or the environment, leading to disastrous impacts overseas. Resentment of these trade policies among working-class Americans helped fuel Trump’s initial rise and continues to benet him today.

I wonder how true this is. ^594627

>  Americans must lead the international community in eliminating the tax havens that enable billionaires and large corporations to hide trillions in wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. at includes sanctioning countries that serve as tax shelters and using the United States’ signicant economic leverage to cut o access to the U.S. nancial system. An estimated $21 trillion to $32 trillion in nancial assets are sitting oshore in tax havens today, according to the Tax Justice Network. is wealth does nothing to benet societies. It’s not taxed and it’s not even spent—it simply ensures that the rich get richer.

I think this is the most interesting policy proposal in the article, even if it is political unfeasible. I wonder how effective it could actually be. ^6a7110
## Thoughts

To me this article feels like it lacks substance. It gives very rudimentary descriptions of foreign policy issues, very simple analysis, and very vague or idealistic solutions. It makes me question Bernie Sanders as a politician, but perhaps it is still good for the nation for someone to play his "roll" in politics.
