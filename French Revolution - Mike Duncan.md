## Introduction

Here I note interesting facts from Mike Duncan's podcast on the french Revolution (either to store or revisit). These are not systematic notes!

## Pre-Revolution Timeline (1715 - 1789)
- September 1715: Death of Louis XIV, beginning the reign of Louis XV
- 1756-1763: Seven Years War
- 1770 - 1774: Rene Nicolas de Maupeou tries to destroy the system of parlements
- May 1774: Death of Louis XV, beginning the reign of Louis XVI (Maupeou's project falls apart)
- August 1774: Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (physiocrat) becomes Controller-General of Finances
- Late 1774: Turgot "frees" the grain market
- April to May 1775: The Flour War (riots over increase in grain prices due to lack of price controls)
- 1775: American Revolution Begins
- 1776: After trying to push through more economic reforms trying to free the market and curtail noble privileges, Turgot is forced to resign. 
- 1776: Necker becomes the de-facto Controller-General of Finances (can't hold the title since he's a commoner). 
- 1781: Necker publishes complete accounting of the royal finances. Demands to be let into the inner circle of the King or he will resign. The King rejects him and he resigns. 
- 1783: Charles Alexandre de Calonne (a careerist?) becomes Controller-General of Finances
- August 1786: Calonne announces to the king that the states financial apparatus was broken and needed to be completely reformed.
- February 1787: The Assembly of Notables meet to approve Calonnes plan (just before Calonnes most vital supporter Vergennes dies )
- March 1787: The approval process is slow going with everyone trying to protect their interests. Calonne tries to appeal to the King to make a speech to get everyone on board but the King is hesitant. Calonne then tries to get public opinion on his side but it burns any remaining good relations with the assembly of notables and they manage to oust him. 
- May 1787: Etienne Charles de Lomenie de Brienne replaces Calonne (becoming minister of finances). He completes the reform package "taking into account" all the grievances, disbands the Assembly of Notables, and proceeds to attempt to register the reform package in the Paris parlement. 
- June 1787: Brienne starts presenting the reforms to the Paris parlement. The parlement refuses to register the most important items of the reform package (in particular the universal land tax) and insist that for a new tax to be registered the King must call the Estates General.
- August 1787: The King tries to use a "lit de justice" (forced registration) to push the reform package through parlement (but falls asleep during the ceremony). The next day the parlement declare the use of the lit de justice illegal. In response the King exiles the parlement to Troyes and orders the clubs in Paris where people discuss current events to be shut down.  
- November 1787: Eventually Brienne gives in and comes to a compromised agreement with the parlement. The King convened the parlement in a "seance royale". He offends the parlement by "ordering" them to approve the monarchy's requested loans (when they were likely going to get approved anyway). 
- April 1788: Two disobedient men from the Paris parlement are ordered to exile, however they take refuge in the Paris parlement itself. After a standoff the rest of the parlement agree to hand them over and they are put in prison.
- May 1788: The King issues a sweeping series of decrees known as the May edicts which gutted the power of the parlement. 
- Summer 1788: Series of protests, demonstrations and riots.
- August 1788: The King is surprised by the magnitude of the protests and caves. At the same time the treasury has nearly run dry. Brienne and the King are forced to call the Estates General (on May 1st 1789). Basically everyone in the Kingdom thought this "mythical" event would solve their problems.  The King invites public debate on the format of the meeting, Brienne thought this was a shrewd political play which would create a wedge between the Nobles and the third estate (over the issue of "double the third, vote by head"), and while it did, it also opened um a forum for more radical ideas.
- August 1788: With the Monarchy needing money to get them through to the Estates General, the bankers forced Brienne to resign and for the King to rehire Necker.
- 1788: Bad weather conditions (starting in 1787) yield a terrible harvest and for poor urban workers, bread consumed up to 60-90% of their income (compared to 30-50%) in normal times. 
- 1788: The Paris parlement was restored. However rather than continuing to oppose the monarchy their focus became restoring order having become increasingly uneasy about their mob support (from the third estate). They also stated that the format for the Estates General should be "vote by order" rather than "double the third, vote by head". This begins to drive a wedge between the previous alliance of the aristocracy in the parlement and the third estate (who previously saw the parlement as defending their interests). 
- November 1788: Necker makes a new Assembly of Notables to decide on the format of the Estates General. They vote overwhelmingly in favour of not "doubling the third" (without even making it to "vote by head"). After this news leaks into the press, public enemy changes from the royal ministry to the aristocracy. 
- November 1788: Adrien Duport (a liberal lawyer and nobel in the Parlement) takes advantage of the unbanning of private clubs to create "the society of 30" a meeting of liberal nobles taking place at his house. The list of attendees included the Marquis de Lafayette, Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target, Marquis de Condorcet, comte de Mirabeau, Abbé Sieyès, and Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. They supported the format of "double the third, vote by head". 
- December 1788:  Necker releases a document which asserts that the "third will be doubled" at the Estates General, however it does not settle the issue of voting. 
- January 1789: Abbe Sieyes releases a pamphlet called "What is the Third Estate?". In it he claims the "the third estate is the nation itself" and the other two estates are just parasites sucking the life out of France. 
- May 1789: The Estates General begins. In a speech given on the first day Necker says that the King will not decree that the nobles and clergy give up their rights to vote by order and must do so voluntarily. On the second day this causes the third estate to "go on strike" until "vote by head" is agreed upon. 
- May/June 1789: After failed talks to come to a compromise with the other two estates, the meetings of the third estate declare themselves the only legitimate body "a meeting of the commons" and give the option for members of the other estates to join their meetings (on their terms) before convening alone. They agree to call themselves the "National Assembly".
- June 1789: During this time Louis XVI's son passed away which devastated both him and Marie Antoinette.
- June 1789: After a narrow vote the third estate agrees to join the National Assembly. This causes the conservative bishops to beg Louis to do something. Necker suggests he organise a royal session of the three estates to reassert order and present a reform package which may appease the third estate. 
- June 1789: The National Assembly is not told about this royal session and the next day they find the doors to their meeting place locked with armed guards. (Apparently it was to prepare the place for the meeting organized by Louis but it is debated to this day whether this was a misunderstanding or intentional). This causes the National Assembly to look for another place to meet, and they find a indoor tennis court a few doors down. Written up by Target, the National Assembly is presented with the affirmation known as the Tennis Court Oath (found below). 
- June 1789: When the National Assembly finally convenes, the King takes a hard-line stance declaring the National Assembly (and its declarations) illegitimate. Even though the reform package he presented may have favoured the desires of the Third Estate, this confrontational approach enraged the Third Estate. After the session they refuse to leave in protest and suggest they would have to be removed by force. Louis (the non committal) says "oh well, let them stay". Furthermore after the news gets out that Necker was not at the royal session (apparently because he was not in favour of the kings hard-line stance) riots start in Paris and Versaille. 
- June 1789: After the failure of the royal session and the remaining clergy as well as several nobles joining the National Assembly, King Louis XVI caves in (once again) and orders everyone to meet as a single body (in the National Assembly). 
- Up to July 1789: With grain prices at their highest since the flower war and a suffering economy with debts coming due, Paris and other cities in France were restless. This was further exacerbated by the absence of the "peoples hero" Necker at the royal session (even though he eventually came out to stop the riots). The ministry began to accumulate soldiers in Paris to quell riots. At first this was done behind the Kings back due to his lack of concentration on state affairs after his sons death. However many of the soldiers refused to follow orders in squashing the riots during the royal session (being sympathetic with the rioters cause) causing the ministry to bring even more soldiers into the city from the outskirts. Over the course of the Estates General they have gone from about 4000 to about 20,000. Many of these later soldiers were german or swiss which fueled conspiracy theories that Marie Antoinette was actively working with her brother Joseph II (the Holy Roman Emperor) to seize control of France and destroy the burgeoning democratic movement. While this conspiracy theory was false, in fact Marie Antoinette was involved in another (smaller) conspiracy with the Kings brother to kick Necker out of the ministry (because he was foreign, protestant and a commoner). NOTE: Necker was popular with the people because "he was about the only guy with power who actively supported subsidised bred and forced price controls" in particular most of the third estate delegates of the National Assembly supported free trade. 

## Revolution Timeline (1789-Present)

### July 1789 (11th - ?th) - The Fall of the Bastille

- 1789 July 11th: Marie Antoinette and the Kings brother (Charles X) convinced King Louis XVI to sack Necker, believing that they had amassed enough troops to withstand the fallout.
- 1789 July 12th: News reaches Paris of Necker's dismissal which causes uproar. In the evening a journalist by the name of Camille Desmoulins and his friends gather at the Palais Royale. At the event Camille steps up on a table and says (roughly) "This is it! They are coming for us, and it is only a matter of time! We can either submit or arm ourselves to see this thing through!" At one point he points a pistol at his heart and says "I would rather die than submit to servitude". This starts a mob which begins to wreak havoc on the streets of Paris. A regiment of German Calvary comes in to try and restore order but they are outnumbered. Units of the French guard are brought in as reinforcements but end up siding with the mob and fighting against the Germans. 
- 1789: July 12th - 14th: A group of municipal Paris government called the "Paris Electors" become the "leaders" of the mob/resistance to the extent that they could control it. They try to transform the mob into a somewhat organised militia. 
- 1789 July 14th: The militia storms the Hotel des Invalides and manages to seize a large quantity of muskets without gunpowder. Having anticipated this occurrence, all gunpowder had been transferred to the Bastille over the last few days where they felt it was much more protected. The militia then meets outside the Bastille where they intend to acquire the gunpowder needed to operate their weapons. Despite the Bastille being quite the stronghold, the guard stationed at the fortress was relatively weak. While representatives from the Paris Electors try to negotiate with the guards to give them the guns and ammunition stored at the fortress the militia/mob grows restless. A few members of the mob manage to scale the laws and open the drawbridge causing the mob to rush inside. The guards began firing at the mob rushing inside. Eventually guard units outside of the fortress sympathetic to the militia begin to join on the side of the mob and add professional support to the siege. Eventually the mob wins, ransacking the fortress and lynching some of the guards (after refusing to accept their surrender). 
- 1789 July 15th: Louis XVI announces to the National Assembly that he is going to pull the soldiers out of Paris. A delegate of the national assembly (including Lafayette and Jean Bailly) heads to Paris to give the news. The Paris electors ask Lafayette to take command of the citizens militia (which will soon be organised into the national guard) and a new system of municipal government is put in place called the "Paris Commune" which elects Bailly as mayor. 
- 1789 July 16th: Louis XVI comes to Paris to confirm the removal of the French of Military as well as the appointments of Lafayette and Bailly. He also announced that Necker would be tracked down and brought back to run the ministry. At this point it was clear to all that the Monarchy has lots its power. Meanwhile the Kings brother Charles X flees Versailles.
- 1789 July 22nd: The former intendent of Paris (the public servant of the monarchy in charge of the city) was captured by members of the militia at his country house to bring him to Paris to answer against charges against starving the third estate. On their way into the city the militia was interrupted by a mob which beat him, stoned him and then lynched him. On the same day the current Controller-General of Finances Joseph-Francois Foullon was also lynched.

After these events "The Great Fear" takes over France (partly fueled by rumours of an aristocratic famine plot). Peasants start forming protective associations, people stop paying taxes or other debts etc... essentially France starts descending into the direction of anarchy.
### August 1789 - The Declaration of Rights of Man 

- 1789 August 4th: In one "delirious" night (described as surreal by attendees) members of the National Assembly try to "one up" each-other by proposing the removal of policies and privileges of the Ancien-Regime. Even the nobles, clergy and business men of the third estate propose to renounce their own privilege. Things like noble hunting rights, and church tithes were abolished. By the end of the night feudalism in France is essentially abolished. The only three motions that didn't pass were "freedom of religion for protestants", "abolish slavery in the colonies" and "abolish nobility outright". 
- 1789 August 11th: The National Assembly draws up a more "sober" version of the August 4th declaration. In particular they agreed that those who lose their privileges (which they viewed like property) should be compensated for their loss. For example if you had feudal obligations you would have to buy yourself out of them (however in practice many peasants just stopped following their obligations without paying until eventually the requirement was dropped). News of the August 11th decree finally manage quell the protests and mob violence occurring throughout the nation.
- 1789 August 26th: The National Assembly passes the "[Declaration of Rights of Man](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp)"

After the August 11th decree the National Assembly begins to split into factions. In particular reactionary conservatives, radical liberals (for example from the society of 30),
and the centrist Monarchiens. At this points the reactionary conservatives found themselves working with the Monarchiens as the most powerful force within the national assembly, however most delegates were still neutral so voting could always flip one way or the other. 
### September 1789 - Monarchiens in the Drivers Seat
- 1789 September ?: One of the main debates within the National Assembly was whether the King should have a veto over legislature in the new system of government. The conservatives and Monarchiens advocated for a unconditional veto whereas the liberals argued for no veto at all. Necker suggested a compromise where the King would have a suspensive veto meaning that he could only suspend bills rather than nix them entirely. Many of the neutrals in the National Assembly liked this compromise and eventually the liberals (realising that they were weaker than the conservative Monarchien alliance) put their support behind a suspensive veto which allowed it to pass. In the end however, the Monarchiens out manoeuvred the liberals and managed to write the terms of the suspensive veto in such a way that it was effectively an unconditional veto. News of this suspensive veto was received poorly in Paris  and the idea started to circulate that perhaps the National Assembly was betraying the revolution. 
- 1789 September 12th: Jean-Paul Marat starts a newspaper called *L'Ami du peuple* which becomes the "quintessential polemicist of the revolution". At this point in time he called for the purging of conservatives from the national assembly and lynching of "aristocratic swine". 
- 1789 September 14th: King Louis XVI calls in the Flanders regiment from the north-eastern frontier (a highly disciplined regiment) to protect Versailles. He then starts to try to renegotiate some of the details of the August 11th decree which he previously promised to sign if he got his suspensive veto passed.  
- 1789 September ?: Under pressure from the National Assembly King Louis XVI eventually agrees to publish the August 11th decrees but not "promulgate" it. This is seen as an insult by many. 
## October 1789
- 1789 October 4th: King Louis XVI once again goes back on his promise and refuses to sign the "Declaration of Rights of Man" without changes 
- 1789 October 5th: Mass demonstration of angry housewives in Paris occurs over lack of bread, high prices for bread, and the merchants profiting from the peoples misery. They manage to break into the Hotel de Ville and seize guns and cannons. The national guard refused to fire at them so they were essentially allowed to do as they pleased. They then decide that they need to protest at the "source" and head to Versailles. The rank and file of the National guard decides that they wish to join them (believing that they must replace the Flanders regiment as the King's body guard to protect him from the influence of evil aristocrats) and Lafayette is essentially coerced into leading them. Upon arriving in Versailles Lafayette explains that he has lost control of his men and tells Louis XVI that in order to defuse the situation he needs to dismiss the Flanders regiment and relocate to Paris. Louis XVI agrees to all demands except for relocating to Paris (which he says he needs to think about). 
- 1789 October 6th: The next morning (while Lafayette is still asleep) someone opens the gates to Versailles where the women's marchers were camping out and they coming rushing into the palace grounds. The protests immediately turns violent with casualties on both sides. A group of national guardsman manage to secure the royal family although the women's marchers manage to lynch some palace guards and parade their bodies around. This event convinces Louis XVI to agree to move to Paris and let the national guardsmen become his official body guards. In light of this decision the National Assembly votes to also relocate to Paris.

## Miscellaneous List of Characters

Jean Sylvain Bailly (1736-1793)
- French Astronomer, mathematician, freemason (one of the only delegates to the Estates General with national recognition
- Presided over the tennis court oath (was the person raising his hand in the famous painting drawing by Jacques-Louis David depicting the event)
- Was made President of the National Assembly (due to his national recognition)

## French Revolutionary Factions

### Monarchiens (The Monarchist Club): 

Lead by [Jean Joseph Mounier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Joseph_Mounier) 

They were a centrist faction that wanted a constitutional monarchy. In particular they tried to be a stabilising force between the more radical liberals and the conservative reactionaries. 

## Important Enlightenment Thinkers



- Voltaire (1694-1778): on religion (criticised the church)
- Montesquieu (1689-1755): on politics (published the "The Spirit of the Law" - authoritative text on science of politics, advocated for separation of powers)
-  Rousseau (1712 - 1778): anti-enlightenment??? (Romantic Movement + "The General Will")

## The Enlightened Absolute Monarchs

- Frederick the Great (1712 - 1786, King of Prussia: 1740 - 1786)
- Catherine the Great (1729 - 1796, Empress of Russia: 1762 - 1796)
- Joseph II (1741 - 1790, Holy Roman Emperor: 1765 - 1790)

Public opinion supported the Parlement (under the guise of liberty) even though they were fighting mostly to keep their noble privileges.  

## Political Landscape in Europe

On the eve of the Revolution there were 5 great powers in Europe:
- France
- Austria (HRE)
- Prussia
- Great Britain
- Russia

Notice that only France and Austria were great powers during the 17th century. Great Britain, Russia and Prussia only started taking off at the start of the 18th century. (Also notice that Spain has decayed from great power status). 

### Great Britain

The Glorious Revolution gave Great Britain a constitutional monarchy which allowed them to mobilise their wealth far more efficiently than the autocratic nations on the continent.

### Austria

"The Habsburg Monarchy" - most powerful family within the Holy Roman Empire. The central aim of French foreign policy since the Bourbons came to power (in the 1500s) 
was to contain the Habsburgs. Louis XIV formed an alliance with the Swedish, Polish and
Ottomans for this goal. This network broke down after Louis XIV death, partly because the rise of Russia where they weakened all three of France's allies. 

### Russia

Russia was not considered a serious power in Europe until "the great modernizer" Peter the Great (1672 - 1725, Tsar of Russia: 1682-1721, Emperor of Russia: 1721-1725). They weakened all three of France's allies (Sweden, Poland and the Ottomans). 

### Prussia

Prussia rose from a Polish fief to a sovereign duchy to a powerful state partly by supporting Habsburg hegemony within the HRE. 

### War of Austrian Succession

Being the last male Habsburg, Charles VI was worried about a succession crisis. He issued an edict in 1713 making it possible for his daughter to inherit all Habsburg possessions. When he died in October 1740 his daughter Maria Theresa (mother of Marie Antoinette) did inherit the Habsburg dynastic holdings, but since she couldn't become Holy Roman Emperor,
Habsburg enemies, including Frederick the Great, disputed her claims to power. This led to a great power war in Europe where France and Spain supported the Prussians, England and the Dutch supported the Austrians. In the end (by 1748), Maria Theresa's claims were validated and her husband was elected Holy Roman Emperor but Frederick the Great kept some of his conquered territory. 

### Diplomatic Revolution of 1756

Great Britain was impressed with the Prussians during the War of Austrian Succession and now felt that the Prussians rather than the Austrians represented the best counterweight to France. Due to the fear of fighting the British navy and Spanish army (alone) the long standing rivals France and Austria signed a treaty of mutual defence. Frederick invaded Saxony, sparking the seven years war. For the Austrians and the Prussians the war was a draw, but the British won big at the hands of the French who were forced to cede their North American possessions (1763). 

### Further Diplomatic Upheavals

Until 1762 Russia had been allied with Austria and France against Britain and Prussia, but the new Tsar Peter II (an admirer of Frederick) switched sides. He was eventually overthrown by his wife Catherine the Great who at first switched back to the Austrians but then eventually switching sides again to form a northern league with the Prussians and British. She pushed the Russian border south at the expensive of the Ottomans in the Russo-Turkish war of 1768-1774. In an effort of great power politics, Austria, Russia and Prussia divide up about a third of Poland's territory among themselves (the first partition of Poland). 

### France Exposed! 

In 1787 two wars break out. Russia (now back in an alliance with Austria) goes to war with the Ottomans. At the same time a civil war breaks out in the Netherlands between the Orangists (supported by Britain) and the Patriots (Republicans supported by France). The Prussians (as part of their alliance with the British) provide military support to the Orangists in anticipation of military support for the Patriots from the French. However the French do not intervene as they are unable to afford support and this exposes the current weakness of the French state to the world. 


## Interesting Insights and Quotes

- "The existence of the audience will soon become a key feature of the French revolution, which is in pretty marked contrast to the English and American revolutions, where all the great oratory was directed at fellow members of parliament or say the continental congress, but the leaders of the French revolution always had a crowd to play to, and the impact of turning governance into theatre would play a major role in how things would unfold."
- "If you will recall from way back when, the big problem with King Charles I was that he wouldn't listen to anyone, he was so insanely inflexible that he basically forced Cromwell to cut off his head. In this respect King Louis XVI was the opposite, he was so flexible that he just couldn't stick with any one policy, he was one of those guys who would just go with whatever the last person who talked said."
- "With the convening of the Estates General, and then the immediate grinding to a halt of the Estates General, events would begin to slip out of everyone's control. But though things took a revolutionary turn from day 1, or more specifically day 2, there were a couple of things that we need to keep in mind. First, even with all the underlying problems of the Ancien Regime (the archaic political structure, the archaic economic structure, the archaic judicial structure) it will take a ton of mistakes, miscalculations and misunderstandings to push this thing in the direction of revolution. With just a little bit better leadership the Estates General of 1789 could have been an important point of historical transition for France as it moved towards modernity, but it did not have to spark a full blown revolution." 

## Tennis Court Oath

"The National Assembly,

Considering that it has been called to establish the constitution of the realm, to bring about the regeneration of public order, and to maintain the true principles of monarchy; nothing may prevent it from continuing its deliberations in any place it is forced to establish itself; and, finally, the National Assembly exists wherever its members are gathered.

Decrees that all members of this Assembly immediately take a solemn oath never to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the realm is established and fixed upon solid foundations; and that said oath having been sworn, all members and each one individually confirms this unwavering resolution with his signature.

We swear never to separate ourselves from the National Assembly, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations."

Some additional facts:

- The National Assembly was lead by the Comte de Mirabeau
- Joseph-Ignace Guillotin was the one who suggested meeting at the Tennis Court.
