## 3.0 Revolutions Podcast Update

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Random Insert Revolutions Podcast Update Okay, so before we get going on the French Revolution, I have a little grab bag of logistical behind-the-scenes stuff I want to go through that I didn’t want cluttering up the first episode on the three estates. So in no particular order, here is some stuff.

[(00:35)](#!):

First, the Maiden Revolutions Tour, which I just got back from, was fantastic. We saw the Poet Bridge, where the first English Civil War started, and Fort Royal Park, where John Adams yelled at some ignorant villagers. We saw where Cromwell was temporarily buried in Westminster Abbey before they dug him up and posthumously beheaded him after the Restoration. We went to the site of the Putney Debates, and the Banqueting House at Whitehall, where King Charles was executed. Then we went down to Paris, and saw the Palace at Versailles, and the remains of the Bastille, and the Place de la Concorde, where King Louis and Robespierre were guillotined. We saw Marie Antoinette’s cell, and the chapel where the Girondins sat down to their last meal. In between, we ate, and we drank, and we made merry. There was much merry-making. We’re already planning more tours for next year, another run through England and France for sure, but also an American Revolutions tour through Boston and Philadelphia. So stay tuned, please, because these trips are ridiculously fun, and I want you all to come.

[(01:33)](#!):

Second, a while ago, brilliant listener Joseph suggested a much better way to number the episodes. I wish I had thought of it before the show launched. Instead of just running numbers in sequence like I’ve been doing, I’m implementing a chapter system that will hopefully organize the episodes much more logically. So the English Revolution episodes will now be 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. The American Revolution episodes will be 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and the first episode of the French Revolution will be episode 3.1.

[(02:06)](#!):

While I’m at it, the supplementals will all be properly marked so that they sort in the order they were released. I’m sorry it won’t really help you for those who have come this far with me already, but it’ll be better going forward, and better for new listeners coming in later. You always wish you did everything right out of the gate, but the best you can do when you didn’t is to try and fix it, and this, I think, is a pretty good fix.

[(02:30)](#!):

The next thing is a little bit of a bigger deal. As some of you know, since the start of Revolutions, I’ve been trying to make this what I do. Well, this and being a part-time stay-at-home dad, which, wow, is pretty much the most exhausting job I’ve ever had. As some of you also know, in all the years I’ve been doing this, I’ve been a fairly terrible capitalist, much to the chagrin of my more business-savvy friends and listeners. There’s no merch, I don’t charge for anything, I’m not selling back episodes, really, I’m not very good at squeezing money out of this thing. But I’ve come to a crossroads. What I’ve been doing with the occasional ads, and you’ll see one attached to the next episode, and generous, but always voluntary donations, has been keeping my head just below the waterline. But unfortunately not above the waterline. So going forward, there are going to be a few naked fundraising schemes. I’ll keep it minimal, and tasteful, but to keep this thing going, I’m going to have to get a little more proactive about the money thing. Like there’s this Gentleman Johnny’s Party Train North American Tour 77 shirt that I should probably just be selling. That way I can do what you all keep telling me you want me to do, which is to stay chained to my computer 24 hours a day, pumping out episodes.

[(03:45)](#!):

I’ll end with two notes about the coming French Revolution series. First, I have decided to throw out the window any attempt to confine it to 15 episodes. There’s so much to talk about, and so much of it is so wonderfully complicated, that we’re just going to go through it at whatever pace it takes. I would not be surprised if we don’t get to Napoleon until Christmas.

[(04:06)](#!):

Second, French is not a language I excel at. But in anticipation of the problem, I did come up with a massive list of every person, place, or thing I might possibly talk about, and handed it off to five very generous French-speaking listeners who offered to help me not fall on my face. So to Brian, and Duncan, and Herv\xc3\xa9, and JF, and Michel, I want to extend my deepest, deepest appreciation. They will deserve all the credit when I get this stuff right, and please none of the blame when I still inevitably blow it. But at least I won’t be calling it the Edict of Nance.

[(04:45)](#!):

Okay, so that is everything for now. To sum up, the tour was great, more to come. Episodes will be numbered better from here on out. I’m going to have to get more proactive about the money thing. And the French Revolution will take as long as it takes.

And this time, I’m gonna stray a bit off topic because as you history buffs know, we are at this moment in the middle of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of World War I. So I cannot let the opportunity pass recommend the greatness that is The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman. It’s just the best book on the beginning of World War I. And since we are in this centennial moment, it’s a good time to finally pick it up.

[(01:05)](#!):

So when you’re done with this episode, go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash revolutions so that they know who sent you. [“The Star-Spangled Banner”] Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.1, The Three Estates. We come now to the greatest revolution of them all, the French Revolution, the standard by which all other revolutions are measured. It was one of the most important events in the history of the world and is widely pointed to as marking the beginning of the modern era.

[(01:49)](#!):

Since its passing, it has also become one of the most fought over pieces of intellectual real estate among scholars of all disciplines. History, obviously, but also economics and sociology and philosophy and political science. Everyone has something to say about the French Revolution. And just to keep things interesting, there is almost no agreement about what its causes were, what its consequences were, nor even what actually happened.

[(02:16)](#!):

Probably the most influential grand theory of the French Revolution came from the Marxists, who painted a deliciously plausible theory that during the 1700s, the proto-capitalist French bourgeoisie acquired a majority share of the nation’s wealth, while simultaneously being denied access to political power within an archaic feudal system later dubbed the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime.

[(02:39)](#!):

So, the turbulence of the revolution was simply the obsolete political structure being forced into alignment with the modern economic structure. In Marxist history, the French Revolution is the great bourgeois revolution that both destroyed the feudalism of the past and set the stage for the socialism of the future. Like I say, this is a deliciously plausible theory, easy to hold in your head, and in broad terms, it looks an awful lot like what happened.

[(03:09)](#!):

But while Marxist theory thrives in the big picture, it usually gets beaten up pretty bad when the details are scrutinized. That’s when we find out that big chunks of the nobility were involved in various modernizing and capitalist enterprises, and far from wanting to tear down the feudal apparatus, members of the bourgeoisie turned out to be some of the fiercest defenders of seigneurial dues and noble privileges because they had just purchased access to those seigneurial dues and noble privileges and wanted to protect their investments.

[(03:38)](#!):

Not all of them did this, mind you, but some of them did, certainly enough to make the story of a battle between one class representing the old ways and another class representing the new ways fall apart, which is kind of a pity because it’s a great theory. But after all the revisionism and post-revisionism and re-post-revisionism, the revolution has been stripped of all order and frankly returned to its native state of pure chaos.

[(04:05)](#!):

But before we can get into the endlessly fascinating and occasionally terrifying march of the French Revolution, we must, as usual, lay our groundwork. So the rest of this week’s episode will be taken up with a rundown of the people who made up pre-revolutionary France, taking as our framework the famous Three Estates. We’ll start with the lowly peasants and wind up with the allegedly absolute monarch of this allegedly absolute monarchy, King Louis XVI.

[(04:34)](#!):

The next week, we will walk through the mess of political, economic, cultural, and religious problems that the Ancien Regime was facing when controller General Calonne told the king in August 1786 that unless drastic financial reforms were initiated, the monarchy was going to go broke. On the eve of the revolution, the population of France was somewhere around 27 million. So right away, it’s worth noting that just in terms of scale, we are an order of magnitude beyond the English and American Revolutions, both of which involved millions of people rather than tens of millions of people.

[(05:12)](#!):

These tens of millions mostly lived in rural areas and were tied to the land. The rest lived in small towns, a few larger provincial cities, and then, of course, Paris, which was not just the preeminent city in France but was in many ways the preeminent city in Europe. Regardless of where they lived, though, the French people were divided up into the famous Three Estates, a division still lingering from the old medieval days when society could be separated into those who prayed, those who fought, and those who worked.

[(05:42)](#!):

The first estate, those who prayed, was the clergy. The second estate, those who fought, was the nobility. And the third estate, those who worked, was everyone else. That is to say, something like 95% of the population.

[(05:59)](#!):

So the vast majority of the Third Estate and about four-fifths of the total population of France were peasants. These peasants can be divided up into three basic subgroups. At the bottom were your landless peasants, forced to become migrant workers or day laborers to stay alive. In many areas, these landless peasants could pick up work in, say, textile manufacturing, as pre-industrial France relied on accumulating the products of thousands of individual homes rather than consolidating workers in a single factory. But as we’ll discuss a bit next week, on the eve of the Revolution, these pitiful folks were dealing with the terrible conundrum of price inflation that was not being matched by wage increases. So even those who found work could often not afford the most basic necessities of life. They might then turn to professional begging, petty theft, and outright banditry, as circumstances dictated.

[(06:53)](#!):

Above the landless peasants, you had peasants who owned or leased a little land of their own. But one of the problems of French agriculture was that the land was divided up into these little tiny plots that could barely sustain a family, let alone produce a surplus for market. Numerous foreign observers passing through 18th-century France commented on just how backward and inefficient French agriculture was, though the North was starting to get into larger-scale production. The dream of these small-holding peasants was to rise up into the ranks of the third and smallest of the peasant subgroups, independent farmers, who owned not only enough land to sustain themselves, but also provide jobs for the rural workers and loan out equipment to their poorer neighbors. These operators were generally loathed and envied by the lower-order peasants, who lived in fear of seeing their own precious holdings gobbled up if they ever fell behind on a loan, while simultaneously aspiring to join the ranks of the independent farmers they feared.

[(07:53)](#!):

So leaving behind the peasants in the countryside, the remainder of the three estates lived in urban areas, though calling them urban is not quite right, as most held less than 2,000 people, and only a few cities exceeded 50,000, like Lyon in the east, Marseille down along the Mediterranean, or Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast. Another 650,000 jammed themselves into Paris.

[(08:17)](#!):

Now, inside the towns and cities, we first find the corollary of the poor peasant in the poor unskilled laborer. These folks are the ones who make getting an accurate gauge on just how many peasants there were difficult, as they were often seasonal migrants from the countryside or relatives of poor agricultural workers looking for a better, or at least a different opportunity in the towns. The best job these poor unskilled workers could hope for would be as a servant in the homes of the better-off families, but barring that, they were forced to rely on the uncertainties of day labor and temporary work projects. They crammed into terrible housing and often wound up in line for charity from local religious orders.

[(08:59)](#!):

Above the unskilled workers, we find, not surprisingly, the skilled workers. The organization of the skilled workers was itself one of the little tributaries feeding into the great river that is the causes of the French Revolution, because the guild system, in all of its restrictive glory, was still in full effect. Apprentices were little more than indentured servants forced to serve some specified time, say seven years, before they were allowed to become journeymen, at which point they often took to the road to ply their trade and get into nasty fights with local competitors or other journeymen they happened to run across.

[(09:35)](#!):

After whatever arbitrary time was up, they were allowed to become masters, buying their way into the club and settling down to set up a permanent shop, taking on apprentices and starting the whole cycle over again. The guild system was a source of constant frustration for those not directly profiting from it, and as the 1700s progressed, and economic theory turned to free trade, the continued existence of the medieval guild system was an affront to thinking men everywhere.

[(10:03)](#!):

It is also worth mentioning that it will be from the ranks of these urban workers, both skilled and unskilled, that the famous sans-culottes will come storming out of as the revolution picks up steam. Sans-culottes, meaning those who did not wear the silk knee breeches favored by the upper classes. Above the skilled workers, we move into the ranks of the secure urban elite, the guys who did favor silk knee breeches, known to us as the bourgeoisie.

[(10:33)](#!):

Now, bourgeoisie is a pretty nebulous concept, and in strict Marxist terminology, they are simply the owners of the means of production, that is, the merchants and industrialists and bankers. But in a broader sense, the bourgeoisie also included the middle class professionals, lawyers and doctors and men of letters. Collectively, they were one of the fastest growing demographic groups in 18th century France, and now held a large portion of the nation’s wealth.

[(11:01)](#!):

But critically, since we are still living in the Ancien Regime, if you were ambitious, you generally did not funnel your money back into the trades that had enriched you. Instead, you aimed at buying your way into the nobility. So you transferred the money you made in the grubby business of trade into land on the one hand, or venal office on the other.

[(11:22)](#!):

Land has, of course, been the great marker of wealth and status for, oh, let’s say the entire history of civilization, so I don’t think that needs much explanation, aside from mentioning that when the up and coming bourgeoisie bought the land, they were quite a bit more diligent about enforcing whatever feudal claims could be made on the tenants, claims that the former noble owners had often long since forgotten about. And in many provinces, complaints about the new bourgeois landlords far outnumbered complaints about the old aristocratic landlords. The other great investment opportunity was venal office. And venal office is simply a government office that is purchased rather than appointed.

[(12:03)](#!):

They were dreamed up first by Louis XIV, but then massively expanded by his successor Louis XV as an easy way to generate revenue for the state without forcing the royal ministry to levy new taxes, which the nobility would no doubt resist. At the eve of the revolution, nearly every one of the 70,000 offices of government was a venal office. Most of them actually did tie into a real job, but some of the most coveted, like that of king secretary, was simply an empty title that carried with it certain privileges.

[(12:36)](#!):

What kind of privileges? Well, many of them came with a promise of ennoblement. Most had to be held for a few successive generations for the ennoblement to kick in, but some, including the aforementioned office of king secretary, brought ennoblement immediately. These offices also usually carried tax exemptions of various shapes and sizes, because as we’ll discuss a bit more next week, pre-revolutionary France operated on the rather upside down principle that the better off you were, the less you paid in taxes.

[(13:07)](#!):

Over the years, these offices became a form of property in themselves, and as the ranks of the bourgeoisie expanded, the prices of the venal offices rose with demand. By the late 1780, something close to a billion lever was tied up in venal office, and yes, that is an insane amount of money.

[(13:27)](#!):

At the very tippy top of the Third Estate was a little group who quote, lived nobly, that is, they no longer even worked at a profession, but instead lived off land rents or other investments. The reason this group was so small was because if you had acquired the means to live nobly, you were probably in the process of buying your way into the nobility, that is, the Second Estate, and leaving the ranks of the Third Estate behind for good.

[(13:56)](#!):

So with the help of some venal office, it’s time to move up into the Second Estate, the nobility. By this point, the population of the nobility was somewhere between 120,000 and 400,000, records being patchy and often unreliable, since there were more than a few forged claims out there.

[(14:14)](#!):

This little clique, and we’re talking no more than one to two percent of the population, owned outright a quarter to a third of all the land in France, and held feudal rights over the rest, that is, the right to collect certain taxes, or the right to force tenants to use your mills and wine presses at whatever arbitrary price you set. They also openly owned a controlling interest in almost all the non-trading commercial pursuits, like mining and metallurgy, and less openly owned a controlling interest in most of the trading industry, using surrogates in the Third Estate to skirt prohibitions on the nobles engaging in trade.

[(14:49)](#!):

So far from resisting the evolution from feudalism to capitalism, the nobility was right in the middle, the nobility was right in the middle of it, at least some of them were, because the nobility was not at all one unified class.

[(15:03)](#!):

For starters, as you can imagine, the old nobility, the ones who could trace their lineage back 700 years, did not think much of the new nobility, you know, the textile merchant who just bought his title last Thursday. These two types were described as the sword nobility and the robe nobility. The former owed their status to their medieval ancestors, having fought alongside the king, the latter to some recently acquired venal office. And by recent, the old nobility meant anything less than about four generations. So the sword nobility generally turned up their noses at the robe nobility, while the robe nobility were ticked off that having climbed into the ranks of the Second Estate, they were still being treated as commoners.

[(15:45)](#!):

It also did not help that because of the way French inheritance laws worked, the fortunes of the old nobility had generally eroded to almost nothing. So most of the wealth of the Second Estate was held by these former shopkeepers who didn’t even know what fork to use at dinner. Not that the cultivated old nobles were at all opposed to marrying their sons to the daughters of these barbaric new nobles. At the very top rung of the nobility though, were those who both held ancient lineages and had managed to keep their fortunes intact, or had successfully gilded their arms as the saying went, by a fortuitous marriage or two along the way.

[(16:23)](#!):

These guys were the ones who were still able to afford to live with the king at Versailles. And they dominated all the major positions in the royal ministry, the military, the judiciary and the church. This group, as you can imagine, tended to be rather conservative, but it is also from these ranks that we find some of the key members of the liberal nobility who will be so essential to the first stage of the revolution. For example, our old friend, the Marquis de Lafayette. So that brings us to the first estate, the church. There were about 130,000 members of the French clergy. And collectively, the church owned about 10% of all the land in France.

[(17:03)](#!):

But as the great historian, Georges Lefebvre noted in his compact but highly influential coming of the French Revolution, when you talk about the three estates of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, you’re really only talking about two estates, the nobility and the commons, because the church was really just a microcosm of the kingdom at large. Way back in 1516, the pope had conceded to the king of France the right to appoint all the bishops and abbots of the French church. Not surprisingly, these top level jobs, which carried with them massive salaries, the right to collect tithes and control of all those church held lands, became dominated by the younger sons of the French nobility.

[(17:45)](#!):

Meanwhile, the vast majority of the 130,000 clergy were parish priests, recruited from the ranks of the third estate, and usually the lower rungs of the third estate at that. Not the lowest lowest rung, since your family still had to buy you some kind of rudimentary education, but there was still a massive gulf between the noble, ecclesiastic authorities on the one hand, and the common rank and file priesthood on the other. This will become a point of major importance when the estate’s general get called, because the parish priests, who had thus far no say in how church wealth was distributed, and who always seemed to see none of the tithe money that is supposed to be, you know, maintaining our parishes, will finally get to voice their displeasure of the fat cat archbishops and parasitic monastic orders who were giving the church a bad name.

[(18:35)](#!):

So finally we come to the top of every pyramid, the center of every circle, the King of France, and we’ll end today with a brief history of the Bourbon dynasty, down to the man who finally landed on the whammy, King Louis XVI. So in 1268, a daughter and heir to the estate of Bourbon married a younger son of King Louis IX, Saint Louis to his friends.

[(19:00)](#!):

This Bourbon branch of the royal family plugged along for nine generations, becoming the kings of Tainy-de-Vas and the Pyrenees along the way, until some nasty business in the 1580s, known as the War of the Three Henrys broke out, during which the Bourbon, Henry of Navarre, ascended to the throne when the sitting King Henry III was assassinated in 1589.

[(19:21)](#!):

But this was pretty awkward, because Henry of Navarre was a Protestant, and he found himself unable, for example, to enter fiercely Catholic Paris. But the now King Henry IV was a practical guy, so he converted to Catholicism to consolidate his hold on the kingdom, though he did also promulgate the famous Edict of Nantes, which granted religious toleration, if not religious freedom.

[(19:46)](#!):

In 1610, Henry IV was assassinated, and he was succeeded by his 10-year-old son, Louis XIII. And the early years of Louis XIII’s reign was dominated by his mother, Marie de Medici, and featured, among other things, the last calling of the estate’s general in 1614, that is, the assembly of the three estates. When Louis XIII came of age, though, power passed into the hands of his principal minister, Cardinal Richelieu, who we all know as the villain from the Three Musketeers, but who also steered France through the Thirty Years’ War, and who began the process of tightening royal authority over the often rebellious nobles out in the provinces.

[(20:25)](#!):

Both Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu died within about a year of each other, and four-year-old Louis XIV ascended to the throne in 1643. Now, as most of you know, Louis XIV is a pretty big deal. He would go on to rule for 72 years, the longest reign in the history of Europe, becoming, along the way, the greatest king in the history of France, you know, the Sun King. More than anyone else, it was Louis XIV who created the final form of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, against which the revolution was eventually waged.

[(20:60)](#!):

During his minority, there was a fairly massive noble revolt called the Fronde, which the king’s forces managed to win. But when Louis XIV began to rule in his own name, he accelerated the process of political centralization started by Richelieu, culminating most famously with his conversion of a royal hunting lodge outside of Paris into the Palace of Versailles. The idea behind this new palace was to both physically project the image of royal power, but more importantly, to force all those nobles who had been causing him trouble from their home provinces to come to Versailles and attend to him.

[(21:37)](#!):

Cut off from their natural bases, implied with lavish gifts and favors, Louis XIV completely domesticated the aristocracy, who now jostled over seats at the theater, undermined each other with petty gossip, and agonized over who would get to stand where when the king woke up in the morning. Over his long reign, Louis XIV spent money without restraint at home, while simultaneously immersing France in a series of war abroad. So it’s clear that the origins of the persistent royal deficits that would dog and then consume his successors got going during the heady days of the Sun King.

[(22:16)](#!):

But that said, when Louis XIV thought when Louis XIV died in 1715, France was basically now the foremost kingdom in Europe, whose cultural and political influence was second to none. This is when practically every court in Europe starts speaking the French language, adopting French fashions, and following French artistic and architectural tastes. How Louis XIV lived so long that he outlasted not only his son, but his grandson, and so it fell to his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV, to succeed him, and yes, that is the third time in a row the French crown has fallen to some little kid.

[(22:52)](#!):

As Louis XV grew up, it became clear that not only did he not have much interest in being king, but he wasn’t very good at it either. For our purposes, his main achievement was to form an alliance with France’s long-time nemesis, the Austrians, in 1756. This alliance led to the Seven Years’ War, a war in which France paid through the nose for the privilege of getting kicked around by the British. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, when the French came out the other side of this expensive debacle, they found themselves still tied to the hated Austrians, which will become an important bone of contention when the revolution gets going.

[(23:29)](#!):

Generally speaking, the nearly 60-year-long reign of Louis XV was marked by political and economic malaise. There were problems that needed answers, policies that needed reforming, and courses that needed correcting, and basically nothing was done. But the reign of Louis XV was also marked by the full flowering of the French Enlightenment, and a fantastic explosion of philosophy and literature and science. And we’ll talk about these dueling trends of political stagnation and intellectual vigor next week when we start laying the groundwork for the looming, but not at all inevitable, French Revolution.

[(24:07)](#!):

So that brings us finally to our man Louis XVI. The grandson of Louis XV, he ascended to the throne in May 1774 at the age of 19. Still young, but he did manage to break the streak of five-year-olds ruling France. Though pretty much everyone agrees that his heart was in the right place, and he genuinely wanted to do right by his people, he was ill-prepared for the role of king. He was bright and athletic, at least in his youth, but he was also shy and uncomfortable in the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, the system set up by Louis XIV basically created the brightest spotlight imaginable for him to step into.

[(24:49)](#!):

His father had died when he was 11, which left him the heir to the throne, and though he received a standard upper-class education in the humanities, he was, for whatever reason, not given much instruction in the practical business of how to effectively rule a giant kingdom.

[(25:04)](#!):

When he was 15, he was married to the 14-year-old Austrian archduchess Marie Antoinette, a pairing that for a good long time was uncomfortable socially, emotionally, and physically, and it was generally unpopular and the source of great public and private mockery. It didn’t help that Marie Antoinette was an Austrian, and by the time they were married in 1770, every Frenchman with an ounce of patriotism wanted to run the Austrians through with a hot poker, not marry their daughters.

[(25:34)](#!):

Now, as I said, when Louis XVI ascended to the throne in 1774, he was an amiable, if hesitant, prince who was not opposed at all to trying to solve some of the problems that had built up over the last century. But as we will see, one of the biggest obstacles to reform was that as much as pre-revolutionary France is depicted as an absolute monarchy, it was, in fact, not that at all, and everywhere you turned, there were entrenched interests ready to fight for their ancient privileges, whatever those interests and privileges turned out to be.

[(26:07)](#!):

That resistance to change only exacerbated all the other issues facing the new king, and next week, we will methodically walk through the list, the completely backward tax structure, the endemic social inequality, a judicial system that prized privilege over justice, administrative jurisdictions that overlapped haphazardly, a church that gobbled up money and seemed to give nothing back, an outmoded and inadequate agricultural economy, and an educated class steeped in Enlightenment ideals who could see what needed to be done, and then watched in frustration as nothing got done, at least until it was revealed that the monarchy was on the brink of financial ruin. [“Pomp and Circumstance”]

## 3.2-The Broken Regime

 [(00:01)](#!):

Okay, so first I have to lead off by saying that I’ve gotten some great feedback on how to start monetizing this thing better, and there will be more to come on that. I’m already working on designs for the Gentleman Johnny’s Party Train t-shirt. But I also have to say that just by mentioning that I was going to start some little fundraisers turned into a little fundraiser all its own. So you guys who just donated in the last week, wow, thank you very very much.

[(00:43)](#!):

But moving on, with the benefit of hindsight, we know that 18th century France was barreling headlong towards revolution. That revolution was by no means inevitable. It took a lot of bad decisions and bad luck to get to 1789, even more to get to 1794. But one thing that I do think was inevitable is that there was going to be reform. There just had to be. The Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime was a mess, something was going to have to be done, and I can’t see how in the end something wouldn’t have been done. Revolution or no revolution. This is not a particularly original argument on my part, since it is one of the underlying ideas of Alexis de Tocqueville’s Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime and the Revolution, published back in 1856. He says, even if it, that is, the revolution, had not taken place, the old social structure would nonetheless have been shattered everywhere sooner or later. The only difference would have been that instead of collapsing with such brutal suddenness, it would have crumbled bit by bit.

[(01:43)](#!):

So change was coming, I mean it just had to.

[(01:48)](#!):

The first thing to note is that the Kingdom of France was not in any way a unified state. It was rather a patchwork of territories acquired piecemeal over the years, and the inhabitants of those territories, though they shared a common classification into the three estates, often had very little else in common. The kingdom ruled by Louis XVI was a cosmopolitan kingdom, whose various provinces had over the centuries been brought together under the French monarchy by marriage and inheritance and conquest. But they still retained their own unique identities. In terms of lifestyle, and worldview, and even language, the people of Provence were not at all like the people of Normandy, who were not at all like the people of Alsace, who were like, you know, German.

[(02:31)](#!):

The traditional division of the French kingdom was into its 39 provinces, 39 at least being the most commonly cited number of provinces. The boundaries of these provinces, which range wildly in size, were rooted in the old feudal domains, many of which had once upon a time been independent and had slowly but surely come under the control of the French king.

[(02:51)](#!):

But when each was brought under quote-unquote control, they usually brought with them a unique set of political privileges and responsibilities, often specifically spelled out in a contract with the monarchy. Feudalism was by nature a transactional political system, where everyone agreed to bind themselves to a set of mutual obligations. So depending on which province you were talking about, there were things the king could and could not do, rights he could and could not trample, tribute he could and could not expect. But of course, we know from last week that steps had been taken to strengthen the central government at the expense of the provincial lords, and indeed there had.

[(03:29)](#!):

During the reign of Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu created a new administrative apparatus that took little notice of the traditional provincial borders. He divided the king’s territory into generalat\xc3\xa9s that were far more uniform in size than the traditional provinces. These generalat\xc3\xa9s, of which there were 36 on the eve of the revolution, were administered by intendants. These intendants were originally conceived as being financial agents of the crown. But after Louis XIV had done his thing, the intendants also acquired quite a bit of political power at the expense of the provincial governors, though the intendants were hemmed in by local custom and rights.

[(04:09)](#!):

Then, just to make things even more confusing, it turns out that there were three different types of generalat\xc3\xa9s.

[(04:16)](#!):

In the core of the kingdom, they were called pays de l’exion, where the intendant once upon a time had been elected by the Estates-General, but since the Estates-General hadn’t been called since 1614, that meant that the intendant in these generalat\xc3\xa9s were appointed directly by the crown, and without any kind of local authority to push back, usually had a pretty free hand in policymaking. This was in contrast to the generalat\xc3\xa9s on the edges of the kingdom that were known as pays d’etat, who had managed to hold on to some autonomy by securing the continued existence of their own local estate provincial, who were allowed to negotiate tax policy with the intendant.

[(04:52)](#!):

Finally, more recently acquired territory usually ceded in some land-swapping treaty were called pays d’imposition, where the existing political, legal, and tax structure were basically kept intact, and all that really changed was that the money was directed now towards Versailles rather than wherever else it had been going.

[(05:10)](#!):

Okay, so that’s all pretty confusing, but then within this big patchwork quilt, there were hundreds if not thousands of towns and municipalities that enjoyed their own little sacred list of privileges and exemptions, which is all too deep for us to get into here today because I also have to mention that the Church operated its own completely different administrative map. They divided the kingdom up into 136 dioceses clumped into 18 archbishoprics, and you shouldn’t even have to ask, but no, the lines of the dioceses do not in any way line up with the provinces or the generalat\xc3\xa9s.

[(05:44)](#!):

But that’s it, right? We’ve finally come to an end of our survey of just how insanely partitioned the Ancien regime was? We wish, because now we have to talk about the legal system, which ran on its own map and frankly seemed designed to make sure that no two subjects of the king lived under exactly the same set of laws.

[(06:03)](#!):

Now broadly speaking, France was operating under two different legal frameworks. Down in the south, they lived under a code system that could be traced back to the Romans, while up in the north the common law system prevailed. Okay, that’s not ideal, but what makes it really crazy is that the individual jurisdictions of the thousands of petty little courts were defined haphazardly and might be linked to geographic area, type of complaint, social status of the defendant, category of the property at stake. A member of the Paris Parliament commented in the 1760s, he said, do we not see every day people obliged to go to law over two or three years and at great cost to find out which judges they will have the misfortune to appear before?

[(06:47)](#!):

And then, even when you did find out which court you were going to have the misfortune to appear before, almost all the judicial offices, that is the judges and the clerks and the prosecutors, were venal offices purchased in the expectation of future profit, so if you want this to go your way, you had better pay up.

[(07:04)](#!):

At the top of this legal system, if it can even be called that, were the 13 parliaments, the courts of final appeal, whose own jurisdictions paid little heed to the boundaries of the provinces and the generalit\xc3\xa9. I’m not going to dwell on the parliaments now, because we’re going to talk about them a lot over the next few episodes, but just know that they too have their own set of unique and long-standing rights and privileges within the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime that they guarded jealously. To sum all of this up, the idea that the Bourbons were running some kind of absolute monarchy is just a fantasy, whatever the palace of Versailles wants you to think. In reality, the king was hedged in on all sides by political and legal fences that had to be respected.

[(07:46)](#!):

On the other side of this maze of political and legal fences was the average subject, who found themselves hedged in too, each seemingly accountable to a set of specific rules and obligations that weren’t shared by anybody else. Nowhere was this lack of uniformity more apparent and more offensive than in the kingdom’s tax structure. The tax structure of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime was a disaster, and if nothing else happened as a result of the fiscal crisis that led to the calling of the Estates-General in 1789 \xe2\x80\x93 that is, had they managed to avoid revolution \xe2\x80\x93 I think the system of taxation would have seen a major overhaul, because you guys, we just cannot go on like this.

[(08:26)](#!):

The main tax, if there was one, was the Thai. The Thai was a tax on land, but critically, for reasons dating back to the days of high feudalism, the nobility and the church were exempt. Indeed, exemption from the Thai was one of the most basic social distinctions going, and one of the reasons all those ambitious members of the bourgeoisie were trying to buy up offices that exempted them from the Thai, it being as much about social status as actual household economics. As you will recall from last week’s episode, though, the nobility and the church combined own nearly half the land in France. So where does that leave the central government when half the land in France isn’t taxable? Now as we will see in a moment, that did not mean that the nobility and the church did not pay money into the royal treasury, but it is still a pretty big problem when the monarchy is facing a fiscal crisis, and the people holding all the nation’s wealth are those least likely to have to kick any of it into the pot.

[(09:27)](#!):

But as I just said, the nobility did kick some money into the pot, it’s just not true if somebody says that the nobility paid no taxes. For example, even though they were mostly exempted from the Thai, in some provinces the tax was attached to the land rather than the owner. So if a noble purchased some commoner land that was subject to the tax, the noble was obliged to pay it. Aside from that, the nobility was also on the hook for the capitation tax, a head tax assessed in part on household income, that applied in theory to everyone, though like everything else in Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime France, you could purchase exemptions.

[(10:05)](#!):

The other big tax that the nobility was subject to was the Vatie M, or the 120th, basically a 5% wealth tax. The Vatie M was dreamed up back in the 1750s by reformers trying to solve the persistent problem of royal deficits and equally persistent problem of most of the nation’s wealth being untaxable.

[(10:24)](#!):

Like the capitation, the Vatie M was supposed to apply to everyone, but like everything else, when it ran the gauntlet of local privileges and noble protests and purchased exemptions, its revenue too fell far short of what the royal ministers had hoped for. Plus, the Vatie M was designed to be a temporary expedient and always carried an expiration date, so if the royal ministry wanted to start a new one, its terms had to be renegotiated all over again.

[(10:53)](#!):

The church, meanwhile, was also technically exempt from taxes, but they too kicked money over to the monarchy in two ways. First, every ten years they would get together and vote a free gift to the crown, an arrangement long understood and expected by both sides.

[(11:08)](#!):

Second, the French church often took out loans on behalf of the monarchy. They were almost always able to get way better rates than the crown could, and then the church and its benevolence would shoulder the costs of the interest while passing the money itself over to its partners in the royal ministry. On the eve of the revolution, the church’s revenue was somewhere around 250 million livre per year, of which the royal ministry was seeing about 16 million. Which is a pretty sweet deal, considering the church also had a claim to a 10% forced tithe on everyone, ostensibly to support the local parishes, though very little of which was then being turned around to support the local parishes.

[(11:47)](#!):

So it’s not that the nobility and the clergy didn’t pay anything, it’s just that they weren’t paying anything even close to their fair share. Meanwhile, as you move down the economic ladder you become subject to more and more taxes that you were less and less able to dodge. Beyond the stuff we just talked about, there are two more types of taxes that fell disproportionately hard on the lower classes. Not lower classes, more like the middle class bourgeoisie and wealthier peasants who were getting slammed for just about all of this stuff.

[(12:22)](#!):

First, there was a host of excise taxes on all kinds of stuff, soap and liquor and playing cards, you name it. If you wanted it, there was probably an extra sales tax built into the price. And that was on top of the fact that most of these commodities had already been subjected to internal customs duties, because of course there were tax collectors at every one of our overlapping political boundary lines charging a tariff on goods that wanted to cross. Ancien regime France was the exact opposite of an open market, and getting a commodity from producer to consumer was an expensive proposition. Sometimes you had to pass through a dozen or more customs checkpoints. This inflated prices and made smuggling practically an honorable profession, certainly more honorable than being the middle man who sat around skimming off his cut.

[(13:09)](#!):

The last and most hated of the indirect taxes was the Gabelle, or salt tax. This one was particularly despised, and it forced people to buy salt at an arbitrarily set price, nobles and clergy exempted, of course. The Gabelle was despised, though, not just because it made a basic commodity more expensive than it ought to be, but also because it was assessed at wildly different rates depending on where you lived. Every municipality and province and generalit\xc3\xa9 seemed to be paying a different rate, sometimes two to three times more than the next town over. It was completely crazy, and a daily irritation to put upon commoners throughout the kingdom.

[(13:51)](#!):

The other type of tax the less privileged had to deal with was paid in labor. The most common and most hated was the Courvie, which was an obligation to perform work for the government or hand over your equipment to the government to use if they wanted to build or maintain a road. This is all well and good, I guess, everyone pitching in and whatnot, except that these roads had a tendency to connect cities to noble estates, those nobles of course being obligated to pony up nothing for the much improved lines of communication and travel they now enjoyed. The peasants may have been a simple people, but they weren’t stupid, and they knew that they were shouldering costs they could not afford on behalf of those who clearly could.

[(14:32)](#!):

While they were sitting around recognizing this, they also found themselves subjected to various feudal obligations owed to those same nobles, various little tributes and rents or like the thing where you had to use the nobles mill and pay whatever price was set, or the thing where you couldn’t kill rabbits that are eating your produce because the noble held exclusive hunting rights. It was enough to make you want to grab a pitchfork.

[(14:57)](#!):

Adding to the utterly diabolical tax structure was the fact that the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime France ran on a tax farming system, similar to that of Ancient Rome. If you remember, this is where some corporation pays the government a cut-rate lump sum for the right to go collect all the legal taxes, profit being made in the difference between what you bid and what you collected, which meant that our poor peasants were constantly harassed by less than scrupulous tax farmers who didn’t care that this was the third time they’ve come around to collect the same tax, if you don’t have a receipt then I’m just going to take it again and there’s nothing you can do about it. And for the moment, that was true. There was nothing they could do about it, though they were sharpening their pitchforks.

[(15:39)](#!):

The final punchline to this completely backward and regressive system of taxation was that once you added up all the taxes that were being levied, and then accounted for all the exemptions everyone claimed, what the royal ministers were left with was a revenue stream that was totally inadequate and left persistent deficits in the royal budget that just kept piling up.

[(15:58)](#!):

Which meant that there was only one thing for them to do, and that was take out loans. To get the bankers, both domestic and foreign, to subscribe to a given loan, the monarchy usually had to offer pretty generous terms, and as we’ll get into next week when we start talking about the specific crisis Louis XVI and his ministers were facing after the conclusion of the American War of Independence, as much as anything it was the absolutely crippling great load of interest the monarchy was on the hook for that was dragging it down.

[(16:27)](#!):

So as you can see, the Ancien Regime is something of a mess. It was also very confusing, and self-defeating, and desperately in need of reform. Which brings us finally to the intellectual movement so often associated with the coming revolution, the Enlightenment.

[(16:43)](#!):

Now the Enlightenment is a tricky thing to pin down, but in general it means a promotion of a theory of knowledge rooted in rationality, and evidence, and critical thinking, rather than tradition and superstition. The Scientific Revolution is obviously closely tied to the Enlightenment, but for our purposes here I want to focus on the social and political aspects, as they would seem to have so much to do with this business we’re about to get into where the monarchy and the church wind up being destroyed, and replaced with a republic that for a short time literally worships at the altar of reason.

[(17:16)](#!):

But though this connection seems pretty straightforward, it’s really not, especially because always lurking in the tall grass was the enormously influential anti-Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. So the roots of the Enlightenment as a European-wide movement can be traced as far back as Francis Bacon and Ren\xc3\xa9 Descartes in the early 17th century.

[(17:38)](#!):

But wherever you want it to start, what you see developing by the late 17th century is a class of intellectuals who started questioning everything, and started believing that all that everything could be improved by rational investigation. They started talking amongst themselves and an international network, later dubbed the Republic of Letters, who traded correspondence and books and pamphlets to keep up on the latest theories and discoveries.

[(18:04)](#!):

In France, the Enlightenment starts gaining some steam as the reign of Louis XIV nears its end. Industrial elites started gathering together in Paris cafes and salons to chat about what they thought was right and wrong in the world. When Louis XIV was succeeded by Louis XV, the movement picked up speed because Louis XV was not nearly as diligent about clamping down on possibly seditious activity, and the informal intellectual society started growing, and their philosophical, literary, and scientific works started gaining a wider audience. These writers and journalists and scientists became known as the philosophs, who you might describe as practical philosophers, less interested in abstract metaphysics, and more interested in practical reform. They inhaled and then spread the ideas of Locke and Newton coming down from England, they believed in individual rights and the scientific method, and above all, the infinite capacity of humanity to improve its state by applying the great faculty of reason.

[(19:07)](#!):

Adding to the spread of Enlightenment ideas was the increase in literacy, and an increase in the purchasing power of the bourgeoisie that allowed them to spend some disposable income on the latest books and pamphlets. This was also enabled by the generally lax censorship during the reign of Louis XV. There were all kinds of rules about what could and could not be published, and a lot of what was being handed around in mid-18th century France probably should not have been. But the authorities had adopted a graduated structure to distinguish between what they considered beneath their notice, what they didn’t like but would tacitly permit, what they would shut down if they found it, and what they would actively seek out and destroy.

[(19:47)](#!):

So as I mentioned last week, the critics of the ASEAN regime were enabled by the very royal malaise they often criticized, and a whole body of social commentary built up over the years as just about every social, political, and economic institution in France was judged and found wanting. The greatest example of this spread of knowledge \xe2\x80\x93 and often dangerous knowledge \xe2\x80\x93 was the premier cooperative project of the French Enlightenment, the Encyclopaedia, organized and edited by Denis Diderot.

[(20:17)](#!):

The idea behind the project initially was to just collect virtually all human knowledge into a single source, but it soon progressed into not just collecting, but advancing knowledge. And most of the great Enlightenment-era thinkers and scientists contributed essays on various topics, including Voltaire and Montesquieu and Rousseau, the three guys we’re about to talk about.

[(20:38)](#!):

The Encyclopaedia eventually ran to 28 volumes, published one at a time between 1751 and 1772, representing the most advanced views on a wide range of topics, including politics and religion. It was naturally opposed by the royal and ecclesiastic authorities. And so the Encyclopaedia had to live in that gray area of tacit permission to publish, that could be revoked at any moment.

[(21:04)](#!):

Now as you can imagine, one of the chief targets of the philosophs was the Catholic Church, which in their view used fear-inducing superstition to extract money from gullible fools. They never tired of pointing out the blatant hypocrisies of the Church, whose leaders lived in lavish style while the souls they were supposed to be saving lived in abject poverty, a poverty exacerbated by a forced tie that men in silk robes with bejeweled hands collected from peasants in rags without any apparent moral dilemma.

[(21:35)](#!):

The greatest enemy of the Catholic Church during the Age of Enlightenment was of course Voltaire. Voltaire burst onto the scene in 1718 and then spent the rest of his 60-year-long public career railing against the clergy, in essays and novels, letters, plays, poems. But it is important to note that most of the philosophs, Voltaire included, were not atheists. They were instead deists. They believed in a supreme being who created and set the universe in motion, but they were supremely skeptical of all this talk about a god who played favorites on the mortal plane, the miracles he was supposed to have performed, and the hell he would send you to if you offended him. This they believed was all complete nonsense, and guys like Voltaire turned a biting and sarcastic wit against the clergy who promoted all of this nonsense simply to exploit the ignorant masses. And Voltaire famously quipped that, quote, the first priest was just the first rogue who met the first fool.

[(22:36)](#!):

Now if Voltaire was the great voice of the Enlightenment on matters of religion, the great voice on matters of politics was a guy we talked about a bit at the end of the American Revolution \xe2\x80\x93 Montesquieu.

[(22:47)](#!):

After spending a lifetime traveling and researching and reflecting, Montesquieu published The Spirit of the Laws in 1748, and it became the authoritative text on the science of politics. All the men who tried to remake France in the 1790s used Montesquieu as their touchstone \xe2\x80\x93 which is a bit ironic, as Montesquieu was conservative and approached politics with a particularly aristocratic worldview that would have made him the darling of the revolutions for about a week and a half in 1788, and after that a counter-revolutionary pig. Montesquieu, as you know, believed in the separation of powers, and balanced government, and the necessity of public consent to protect liberty and property. He also believed that there had to be intermediary institutions between the rabble and the power \xe2\x80\x93 or the whole thing would spin off into anarchy.

[(23:37)](#!):

Not only that, but Montesquieu was also deeply committed to the idea that political institutions must conform to the societies within which they are made. For him, there was no universally pure model, and there was no sense in trying to cram a square peg into a round hole. Montesquieu’s theories were taught everywhere, and read by practically every major revolutionary figure, and despite his obviously conservative worldview, they all treated him as the authority on building a just and rational and stable government, which will become super important when everyone goes off to build a just and rational and stable government, not that they ever really had much success.

[(24:18)](#!):

So we’ll finish today with the Enlightenment-era writer and philosopher who wound up completely opposed to the prevailing spirit of the times, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He first came to the public’s attention in 1750, when he submitted an entry to an essay contrast sponsored by the Academy of Dijon. The question was, has the restoration of the sciences and arts contributed to the purification of morals? The expected answer being, well, of course, and the difference between the essays would simply be how eloquently this obvious answer was presented.

[(24:51)](#!):

But Rousseau’s submission, now known as the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences, said, no, man is naturally good, and human institutions serve only to corrupt his natural goodness. The essay, written with passionate force, won first prize. And I’ve never seen this anywhere else, but I had a professor in college tell me that the reason it won was because the judges believed it had been a masterful work of satire, and that they tried to rescind the award when they found out that Rousseau was serious.

[(25:22)](#!):

From that point on, Rousseau spent the rest of his life expanding on this theme, and his work would help form the basis of the Romantic movement that would take hold in the early 19th century as a direct reaction to the failures of Enlightenment rationalism. Today, his most famous book is The Social Contract, which describes an idealized system of political authority that properly aligns to the natural sovereign will of the people. And we’ll talk more about this concept of the General Will when we start plunging into the more nightmarish episodes of the Revolution, because as it turns out, you can justify an awful lot if you think you are defending this thing called the General Will.

[(25:60)](#!):

But at the time, his most popular works were Emile, A Treatise on Education, The Confessions, A Soul-Searching Autobiography, and then Julie, or A New Eloise, a story of forbidden love which no one reads today but at the time was probably the best-selling book of the century. What struck such a chord was not so much what Rousseau was saying, but how he said it. He was all passion and emotion, which blew the minds of the reading public who were used to the dry intellect of the philosophs.

[(26:30)](#!):

When he died in 1778, a cult of personality had already grown up around Rousseau, of which many of our future revolutionaries were enthusiastic members. So as obvious a role as the Enlightenment played in the coming Revolution, there is no doubt that it does not give you a complete picture of what informed the worldviews of the men and women who would help bring it about. So we’re going to leave off there for this week. So what we’ve got is a regime in need of reform, and a thousand ideas swirling around out there about how best to reform it.

[(27:05)](#!):

Next time, we’ll start getting into the specific failed attempts to implement some of those thousands of reform ideas around the time power was passing from Louis XV to Louis XVI, the effort to scale back the power of the parlomah, for example, or all the economic reforms that the physiocrats tried to push through.

[(27:23)](#!):

Unfortunately for all of us, though, we have been hit with a minor family emergency, and I’m not going to be able to put an episode out next week. It’s completely lame, I know, because I just came back, and I promise you I do not want to have to set the show aside because I’m just starting to get warmed up here. But it is what it is. So when we come back in two weeks, we’ll dive into the specific chain of events that led ultimately to the Ancien Regime not crumbling bit by bit, but rather with that brutal suddenness.

## 3.3- Resistance to Reform

 [(00:01)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.3 Resistance to Reform As we discussed last time, almost every aspect of ancien r\xc3\xa9gime France was in need of reform. But unfortunately, reform was just not happening. It would be a mistake, though, to picture the years leading up to 1789 as a period of lethargic inertia. The kingdom’s problems were well known to the royal ministry, and through the 1770s and 1780s, they did attempt to address a few of the more flagrant issues. Unfortunately, these stabs at reform provoked resistance from whatever group happened to be profiting from the existing system, whether that profit came in the form of money, or power, or status. What this all wound up boiling down to was a running battle between those who believed that France’s problems could be solved only by re-founding the kingdom on the principles of enlightened absolutism, and those who believed that traditional privileges, rights, and interests must be protected from the encroaching tentacles of tyranny. Both were partly right, both were partly wrong, and combined, they ensured that nothing of great substance was done until it was way too late.

[(01:28)](#!):

So when we were discussing the Enlightenment last time, I purposefully left out a discussion of this concept of enlightened absolutism, because I thought it would work well as an introduction to the stuff we’re going to be talking about today, as power passes from Louis XV to Louis XVI.

[(01:45)](#!):

Now enlightened absolutism, or enlightened despotism, is a concept that can trace its roots back at least as far as the philosopher-king of Plato’s Republic, and in 18th century Europe, it meant a monarch who was educated in modern ideas, concerned about the well-being of his subjects, and who wielded enough power to force through the kind of reforms advocated by enlightened men of letters. Because, as it turns out, most of the philosophs running around out there, including for example Voltaire, were in favor of strengthening the monarchy, not weakening it. My European friends out there won’t find this the least bit surprising, but it’s a little off-kilter for us Americans because the guys who represent the American Enlightenment, guys like Franklin and Jefferson and Madison, well they all wound up Republicans. But back in the old world, Enlightenment thinkers surveyed the political landscape and determined that the only way to drag their kingdoms into the modern era was if a wise and benevolent and powerful executive did the pulling. And during the 18th century, there was a trio of monarchs who seemed to prove this point. Frederick the Great of Prussia, who ruled from 1740 to 1786 and is essentially the great enlightened monarch, Catherine the Great of Russia, who ruled from 1762 to 1796, and then Joseph II, who was Holy Roman Emperor from 1741 to 1790. All three in their own way modernized their kingdoms, promoted the arts and sciences, reformed outdated legal systems, military structures and economic relationships, you know, like all the reforms that Ancien Regime France was desperately in need of, especially if France hoped to keep up with her rapidly modernizing European rivals.

[(03:30)](#!):

But of course, power is a zero-sum game. So strengthening the central monarchy meant that someone or something out there was going to get weaker. And what’s kind of ironic is that the guy who everyone tended to revere as the great French political scientist, Montesquieu, did not believe in enlightened absolutism at all. As I mentioned last time, Montesquieu approached politics with an aristocratic worldview that favored curtailing rather than enhancing royal power. He advocated separating and balancing power, not dumping it all in the hands of one man.

[(04:04)](#!):

And we don’t have to look very far to come up with an explanation for this worldview because Montesquieu spent his formative years in the parlemens of Bordeaux. And in Ancien Regime France, the parlemens were the institution that stood to lose the most if enlightened absolutism wound up carrying the day. As we’ll soon see, the years leading up to the revolution can easily be framed as a conflict between the monarchy on the one hand and the parlemens on the other. As it would turn out, it was a conflict that neither would win.

[(04:37)](#!):

So as you know, the parlemens were, in the main, judicial courts of final appeal. Originally there was just the one, it was based in Paris and covered the whole kingdom. But as new provinces were absorbed, regional parlemens were established, for example the one based in Bordeaux that Montesquieu was a member of. On the eve of the revolution, there were thirteen, collectively made up of somewhere between a thousand and twelve hundred magistrates, who formed the cream of the robe nobility. Their seats were technically purchased from the crown, but by the late eighteenth century they had all been held and passed down through multiple generations. So the members of the parlemens occupied a kind of middle ground between the old old nobility and the new new nobility. They also represented a provincial check on the centralizing instincts of the monarchy. The members of the provincial parlemens were all distinguished local leaders who battled incessantly with the royally appointed intendance over the implementation of policy. They were hyper-aware of their privileges and the special role that they played in the political order of the ancien regime.

[(05:43)](#!):

What was that special role? Well above and beyond their judicial functions as courts of appeal, it turned out that any law promulgated by the king had to be registered in the parlement to take effect. The magistrates took this act of registration seriously and did not believe it was their job to provide a mere rubber stamp for the king. Because not only were they allowed to consider and debate the proposed new law, they were allowed to send back to the king a remonstrance, tallying up the things they didn’t like, and then delay registration until the king either stripped out offending clauses or provided satisfactory reasons for keeping them in.

[(06:22)](#!):

This gave the parlemens collectively a sense that they were the defenders of political liberty in France, because without them keeping watch, the king would quickly become a tyrant. Now of course, as with so many other French political institutions, the parlemens had been pretty well brought to heel by Louis XIV. But after his death, they started to flex their political muscle again, constantly pushing back against the ministries of Louis XV, perfecting the art of delay and obstructionism, and forced the king to modify or give up anything he wasn’t ready to battle to the death over.

[(06:58)](#!):

But there was a limit to how far the parlement could hold back the monarchy, because at the end of the day, the king held the final trump card, a trump card called the Lido Justus. This was the king exercising his prerogative to come down to the parlement in person and after a fancy ceremony, forced registration of the new law by his own royal authority.

[(07:21)](#!):

Now if you’re the king, you don’t want to resort to a Lido Justus, because it looks bad and concepts like public opinion are starting to work their way into the political process. But during the reign of Louis XV, the use of the Lido Justus picked up because it had to. The parlement were pushing back against royal edicts with increasing frequency, especially after the first Vatim was created in 1749, that was that 5% income tax that was levied on everyone equally. As you can imagine, the nobles of the parlement did not think much of this tyrannical encroachment on their privileges and they fought its implementation. And this is a good example of why so many French philosophs supported the idea of enlightened absolutism. All the royal ministry was trying to do was get the government on sound financial footing by spreading taxes more equitably across the three estates. What could be more rational and more beneficial? And here’s this little click of self-interested nobles trying to stop it, just because they didn’t want to kick in their fair share. It’s maddening.

[(08:25)](#!):

That said, the magistrates were pretty good at convincing the public that the cause of the parlement was synonymous with the cause of liberty and justice, and public opinion generally supported them in their battles with the monarchy. These running battles finally came to a head during the last ministry of Louis XV, a ministry led by a guy named Ren\xc3\xa9 Nicolas de Maupou.

[(08:49)](#!):

Now Maupou came up through the ranks of the Paris parlement, and during the 1750s he was actually a key player in the defense of the parlement against royal encroachment, a defense he continued to wage when he became president of the parlement in 1763. But then, in 1768, Maupou became Lord Chancellor, that is, the royal minister in charge of the French judiciary. No doubt his colleagues in the parlement hoped that from this position, Maupou would continue to defend their interests. But the appointment put him on the other side of the political fence, as it was the Lord Chancellor’s job to ensure that royal decrees were duly registered by the parlement, and Maupou embraced his new role as advocate for the monarchy.

[(09:34)](#!):

After being appointed Lord Chancellor, Maupou engaged in some court intrigues \xe2\x80\x93 far too esoteric for us to get into here \xe2\x80\x93 that resulted in the appointment of Joseph-Marie Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 as Controller-General of Finances in 1769, and then Maupou’s own appointment as Chief Minister in December 1770.

[(09:53)](#!):

Maupou and Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 were interested in putting the monarchy on better financial footing, and so they naturally targeted noble tax privileges. But they also had their eye on reforming the tax farming used to collect all those indirect taxes we talked about last week. To ensure the reforms could be implemented smoothly, Maupou started undercutting the authority of his old friends in the parlement. He issued decrees designed to limit their ability to stall legislation, and he hindered the ability of the 13 parlement to collectively communicate with each other. The Paris parlement, of course, refused to register these decrees. And so in December 1770, just as he was being appointed Chief Minister, Maupou convinced Louis XV to issue the Lide Justes and force registration.

[(10:41)](#!):

Once he was officially Chief Minister, he punished the Paris parlement by suspending their functions and exiling them from the city, which was a pretty audacious power play. After sweeping aside the Paris parlement, Maupou set himself to creating a completely new judicial system for France. He established a temporary judicial council to keep the wheels of justice moving until he could implement his new scheme, which featured six superior court districts and a reconstituted Paris parlement that would be staffed by magistrates appointed and paid by the crown, rather than by nobles who had inherited their positions. You know, like he had once done.

[(11:23)](#!):

But this was just the beginning. Maupou was aiming at nothing less than the wholesale abolition of the ungodly patchwork of courts that defined the French judicial system, hopefully replacing it with a uniform set of laws and courts. Resistance from the provincial parlement to all of this was of course swift, which led Maupou to simply suspend and banish whoever didn’t like the new order.

[(11:47)](#!):

Now this is all pretty heavy-handed, but alongside the resistance, it would appear that a lot of people in the legal community looked at the reforms with undisguised relief. The Paris bar agreed to carry on their legal work under the new framework, and many ambitious and or enlightened lawyers were all too happy to take up appointments in a system that promised to be more rational and more equitable.

[(12:11)](#!):

With the parlement out of the way, Maupou and Controller General Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 went back to trying to establish a better tax structure and rein in the abuses of the tax farmers. But all this ultimately accomplished was to add to the ministry’s growing list of really powerful enemies. Maupou managed to hold the line because he retained the confidence of Louis XV, but Louis XV was pretty checked out by this point in his reign, and not particularly popular with anyone anyway. So with each passing year, support for Maupou’s grand reorganization dwindled, especially because backers of the parlement were, as I said, quite adept at framing all of this as a battle not between a modernizing ministry and selfish defenders of old privilege, but rather as a battle between a tyrannical ministry and the great defenders of French liberty.

[(13:02)](#!):

When Louis XV finally died in May 1774, it swept away the last political leg Maupou and his allies had to stand on. After a few months, the new 19-year-old King Louis XVI was convinced to scrap the whole reform project, sack Maupou and his ministry, and reinstate the parlement to their former positions.

[(13:24)](#!):

But though the return of the parlement was greeted with great public fanfare, the whole business left everyone just a little worse for the wear. The prestige of the monarchy was damaged by Maupou’s heavy-handed tactics, and the parlement were now divided internally between those in the legal community who had fought the good fight and those who had tried to reconcile themselves to the new order, leading to petty squabbles when the old order was reinstated that didn’t make anyone look good.

[(13:52)](#!):

One final note on this, just for the sake of historical trivia, is that Maupou wound up being the last Lord Chancellor of France, because when he was dismissed, he refused to resign his office and was still technically Lord Chancellor when the office was abolished by the Constituent Assembly in 1790. Although any hope at reforming the judicial system was now pretty much dead, there was still a chance for economic and financial reform.

[(14:20)](#!):

But after Controller General Terre was shown the door along with Maupou in August 1774, those economic and financial reforms took on an entirely different character, because the new Controller General was a guy named Henri-Robert-Jacques Turgot, who was an acolyte of something called Physiocracy. Physiocracy was an economic theory that existed in between the dying theory of mercantilism and the rising classical liberalism that Adam Smith was currently hard at work on up in Scotland. The Physiocrats believed first and foremost that the wealth of the nation was rooted exclusively in the land. It wasn’t about amassing gold or having a favorable balance of trade with rival powers. It was about agricultural labor. Everything else was merely a secondary offshoot. But when it came to those secondary offshoots like manufacturing and trade, the Physiocrats further believed that the economy should be as free as possible. So they believed, for example, that the guild system was an anachronism that needed to die, that the web of internal customs barriers was crippling trade, and that all the indirect taxes on consumer goods hurt the entire commercial chain, from producer all the way to consumer. It was in fact one of the leading Physiocrats, a guy named Vosson de Guarnay, who allegedly coined the term laissez-faire, which roughly translates as let do, as in, let the economy run itself.

[(15:50)](#!):

So as I said, our new controller General Turgot was into all this stuff, having fallen in with the Physiocrats back in the 1750s. Turgot began publishing his own works on economics and philosophy, and like many other contemporary philosophs, including his great friend Voltaire, contributed articles to the encyclopedia. But it was his work as intendant of Limage that really cemented his reputation. Appointed in 1761, he would serve there until he was elevated into the Royal Ministry in 1774, and during those 13 years he was able to put his theories into practice, and Limage became a little Physiocrat laboratory.

[(16:30)](#!):

It was a region hit particularly hard by the haphazard and regressive system of taxation, and Turgot worked hard to complete a modern land survey to distribute the land taxes more equitably. He also sought to lessen the burden of indirect taxes on consumer goods, and most especially convert the corvee, the system of forced labor for public works, into a money tax, assessed on the province as a whole, which was designed to spread the cost of building and maintaining the roads around to everybody. During this period, he also continued to publish his attacks on the crushing great load of obstacles to unleashing the full power of the French economy.

[(17:11)](#!):

With the ascension of Louis XVI, Turgot was immediately appointed Minister of the Navy, and then shortly thereafter named Controller General of Finances, an appointment that was widely applauded by the philosophic community, and no one clapped harder than his old friend Voltaire. Turgot wasted no time getting to work. The state finances were in a bad way. Deficits from the Seven Years War still lingered, the tax structure as we now know was as inefficient as it was inadequate, and the monarchy itself continued to spend money as if nothing at all was the matter.

[(17:46)](#!):

But before getting into what he no doubt hoped would be the thoroughgoing overhaul of French finances, Turgot first did what he could to cut expenses, and he pursued across the board economies in every department up to and including favors and pensions doled out by the royal family to favorites. This as you can imagine ruffled more than a few feathers, and earned Turgot a number of powerful enemies. But it also brought expenses down enough to earn him some credibility with the Dutch bankers, from whom Turgot secured a pretty favorable loan to cover the remaining deficits.

[(18:22)](#!):

But Turgot’s great dream, his great obsession, was setting the grain trade free. Up until now there were all kinds of restrictions on how and when and where grain could be sold, all the way down to enforced price controls on bread, which was the staple of the French peasant diet.

[(18:41)](#!):

Turgot wanted to do away with the entire regulatory structure. It was forever depressing the French economy, which was rooted, remember, in agriculture, because it forced farmers to sell below the worth of their labor. If the grain was set free, and sold where it was needed, when it was needed, for whatever price it could fetch, the entire French economy would blossom. Sure, there might be some kinks at first, but in the long run, wages and prices would no doubt be brought into proper alignment that more accurately reflected the true worth of the French economy, and everyone, landowner, farmer, consumer, would be better off.

[(19:22)](#!):

Unfortunately for Turgot, he launched this project in late 1774, just as France was being hit by bad harvests. At least, bad harvests in some areas, and good harvests in other areas. With all the previous restrictions on the grain trade lifted, those with a grain surplus were now free to sell to those with a grain deficit, at exactly the kind of premium you might expect. It’s called supply and demand. It’s new, but you’ll get used to it.

[(19:51)](#!):

But it was not just the hard-hit areas that paid the premium. Free of regulation, the landowners with plenty of grain to sell were all too happy to move their entire supply out of the home province to fetch the higher prices. Unless of course, you’d care to match the price I’m getting over there. The peasants did not take kindly to these sorts of arbitrary price hikes.

[(20:13)](#!):

And though the terminology wasn’t around yet, the peasants had a rudimentary belief in the so-called moral economy, where the king as father-protector was supposed to make sure his subjects were not gouged by unscrupulous profiteers in times of want. So to the average peasant, by following Turgot’s new free-trade system, the king was failing to perform his most basic duty to his subjects, and when that happened, they felt perfectly justified in taking action. Which is how we get to the Flower War of 1775.

[(20:45)](#!):

The Flower War was a widespread series of uprisings in April and May 1775 that targeted landowners, merchants, traders, bakeries, royal officials, and anyone else who seemed to be unjustly profiting from the depleted grain supply. These uprisings were driven in part by a reoccurring paranoid fantasy within the peasantry that the price increases could not simply be about abstract laws of supply and demand working themselves out. It had to be some sort of conspiracy, a conspiracy that they dubbed the Famine Pact.

[(21:21)](#!):

The Famine Pact was about a shadowy group of large landowners being in cahoots with evil royal ministers to intentionally withhold grain from the market to drive up prices. It wasn’t true, of course, but given the atmosphere, fear and paranoia were the order of the day. By early May 1775, the tumult hit Paris where bakeries were looted, and then finally Versailles itself, where protesters gathered outside the palace to demand that the king take action.

[(21:50)](#!):

In the end, young Louis XVI bowed to the pressure, and after sending out 25,000 troops into the provinces to restore order, he returned to a system of fixed prices that forced farmers to move their grain from where it was to where it was needed without any additional markup. Though the crisis quickly passed, in the flower war we get a glimpse of what’s to come. Because in the late 1780s, even worse harvests will combine with the still-smoldering peasant resentment to spark an even greater wave of rural uprisings.

[(22:25)](#!):

But though the flower war was bad, it didn’t immediately take Turgot down, and he was allowed to keep moving forward with his reforms, even if maybe his most cherished idea \xe2\x80\x93 that of substituting a single land tax for the parade of indirect taxes \xe2\x80\x93 was probably now a dead letter. Of further interest to us here at the Revolutions podcast is the fact that at this same moment \xe2\x80\x93 the spring of 1775 \xe2\x80\x93 the American War of Independence is breaking out, and controller General Turgot winds up being the principal opponent of France getting involved with the American War.

[(23:03)](#!):

Now given his wider Enlightenment beliefs, he sympathized and cheered on the Americans, but argued that for France to actually commit money was like insane. The deficit is barely manageable, our revenue system stinks, and you want me to approve a whole new set of loans to finance a war halfway across the world? No thank you. But Foreign Minister Vergennes made the more persuasive case \xe2\x80\x93 that it would be quick and cheap and best of all humiliate the British.

[(23:33)](#!):

Now I gotta say, if I was in the Royal Ministry in 1775, I would be totally opposed to getting into this war. But as a good patriotic American, I would like to say thank you Vergennes, even if you had a major hand in ultimately engulfing your kingdom in the flames of chaos and revolution.

[(23:53)](#!):

Turgot would of course be proven right. The American War was neither quick nor cheap, and it only kind of humiliated the British. But that prescience did him no good, and he had by now pretty much alienated everyone from the lowliest peasant right up to the Queen herself. And he was probably already a dead man walking when he issued the Six Edicts in January 1776, two of which were particularly controversial \xe2\x80\x93 the partial suspension of the trade guilds, and a nationwide conversion of the corv\xc3\xa9e into a money tax, as he had already done as an intendant of Limage. To make matters worse, in the introductory statement to these edicts, he specifically said that this was all about attacking noble privilege, which meant that the edicts had to be forced through the parlement by a l\xc3\xa9e du justice, which was pretty much the last time Louis XVI stuck his neck out for Turgot. And by May 1776, court intrigue forced him to resign.

[(24:54)](#!):

So as with Maupus, Turgot tried to advance the cause of enlightened absolutism, and used it to reform and modernize aspects of the ancien r\xc3\xa9gime that were long overdue for reform and modernization. And he was met with pushbacks strong enough to topple both him and his reforms.

[(25:13)](#!):

The interesting thing, though, is that in the Flower War, Turgot faced resistance not from the most privileged classes, but from the very least privileged classes. So successfully establishing the kind of enlightened absolutist regime advocated by the philosophs required a king who was as tough as he was farsighted, someone who was willing to overcome the complaints of both his closest courtiers and the anger of the peasant mobs.

[(25:39)](#!):

Unfortunately, Louis XV wasn’t much interested in the job, especially as he neared death, and Louis XVI was as tentative as he was inexperienced. Though neither king was exactly the perfect candidate to bring enlightened absolutism to France. There was still hope for young Louis XVI, though. And maybe as he grew into the crown, it would sit more confidently on his head. Maybe he too would one day join the pantheon of Frederick and Catherine and the great modernization of Europe. Or maybe it would turn out that tentative vacillation was not a character flaw of young Louis XVI, it was a character flaw of Louis XVI, period. Whatever his age might be.

[(26:23)](#!):

I wonder which it could be. Next week, we will push through the last decade of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, before the mare starts to really hit the fan in 1786, and introduce the man whose fate wound up being tied so closely to the early days of the revolution. The Swiss Protestant wonderboy financier Jacques Necker, and his magical ability to distinguish between ordinary and extraordinary royal expenditures.

## 3.4- Necker and the Necklace

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.4, Necker and the Necklace. Last week, we talked about the efforts of successive royal ministries in the early 1770s to reform some of the more glaring problems with the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, and we saw how those efforts were frustrated by those who stood to lose the most from reform, whether they be aristocrats who weren’t about to let their privileges be ignored, or peasants who weren’t about to let free market experiments literally take bread off their table.

[(00:43)](#!):

With the failure of those reforms, the ministries of the late 1770s and early 1780s took a slightly different approach to solving France’s problems. And though it would be an unfair exaggeration to say that that approach was, hey, let’s pretend like nothing’s wrong, as you’ll see, that unfair exaggeration is not too far off the mark. Once we get done talking about that, we’re going to switch gears and trace the steadily declining reputation of Queen Marie Antoinette, because that steadily declining reputation finally curse-splatted for good, just as the hey-nothing’s-wrong attitude was blowing up in the monarchy’s face.

[(01:21)](#!):

So we left off with the ousting of the physiocrat reformer Turgot in May 1776. As his reform package of spending cuts in the palace and free market economics out in the provinces left him with a list of enemies a mile long, it wasn’t hard to see that Turgot would soon be on his way out the door. So as the Comptroller General’s influence waned, one man positioned himself as the best and frankly only candidate to replace him, Jacques Necker.

[(01:49)](#!):

After Turgot got the boot, it would take the king’s advisors a good six months to get Necker elevated into the ministry. But when he was finally brought on board, everyone was convinced that he would be able to lead the royal treasury out of danger and into the promised land of permanent solvency.

[(02:07)](#!):

One of the reasons it took a little while to get Necker into the ministry was that he had three pretty big strikes against him. He was a commoner, he was Swiss, and he was a Protestant. Any one of those alone would have made him suspect to the inner circles of Versailles. Combined, they would have torpedoed a lesser candidate. But Necker was no lesser candidate. He was widely viewed as a financial genius who had the answers to all of France’s problems.

[(02:36)](#!):

Born in Geneva in 1732, Necker had been sent to Paris at the tender age of 15 to work as a bank clerk for an uncle. It became apparent immediately that an aptitude for banking didn’t even begin to describe his talents. He worked his way quickly up the ranks and was made a full partner in his uncle’s bank just after turning 30. Now a wealthy young superstar in the world of finance, Necker founded his own bank and made even more money lending to the royal treasury and speculating in the grain trade. Around this same time, he got involved with a wealthy widow. But when said wealthy widow brought around a pretty Swiss girl named Suzanne Kirchaud, Necker fell in love with Suzanne and dropped, said wealthy widow. Interesting side note is that Suzanne had previously been engaged to none other than Edward Gibbon, but the engagement was broken off when she took up with Necker.

[(03:27)](#!):

The couple was married and then had a daughter in 1766 named Germain, who Madame Necker raised on the educational theories of Rousseau, and when she grew up, Germain became a literary celebrity in her own right as Madame de Stalle, who waged a ceaseless intellectual war against Napoleon, but now I’m starting to drift off topic.

[(03:47)](#!):

With the assistance and or prodding of his wife, Necker started aiming for government office. In the late 1760s, he was appointed director of the East India Company, which like its British counterpart was a privately chartered corporation that held a legal monopoly on the Indian trade markets. The company was failing badly from corruption and mismanagement, and despite his efforts to maintain its independence, the company was liquidated in 1769, and all its assets and debts were taken over by the crown. But this will not be the last we’ve seen of the East India Company. It will be reconstituted in 1785 and then be at the epicenter of a massive scandal in 1793 that was a big part of explaining when and why the revolution began to eat its own children. So watch out for that.

[(04:34)](#!):

Returning to private business, the Necker’s spent the next few years building up Jacques’ reputation as a financial wizard. Madame Necker hosted a well-attended salon that saw most prominent intellectuals and government officials pass through at one point or another. When Turgot took over as controller general in 1774, Necker started publishing economic tracks that attacked the physiocrat reforms, denouncing most especially the free trade in grain. So by the time Turgot was driven from the ministry, it was well known that Necker was sitting on a slate of ideas that ran in the opposite direction to the discredited policies of the physiocrats.

[(05:12)](#!):

Still, as I said, it took a few months to bring him in, and even when he was brought in in October 1776, Necker had to take a less prestigious post because Protestants were not allowed to hold a major office like Controller General of Finances.

[(05:26)](#!):

But whatever the title, Necker was now more or less in charge of the royal treasury. Like everyone else these days, he could see that taxes needed to be distributed a little more evenly across the three estates, but being a banker, Necker was utterly convinced that actually raising taxes was unnecessary, and that the royal treasury would be best served by floating more loans. He was also in complete agreement with Murgent about the benefits of France getting into the American war, and he scoffed at Turgot’s complaints that they just couldn’t afford it. We didn’t have to raise taxes, he said, we can just finance the whole thing and it’ll be fine. Trust me, I’m a financial genius, remember? So off he went to raise the money, offering good rates and utterly self-confident assurances that the royal treasury was in great shape. On the strength of his personal reputation more than anything else, Necker got his loans. Even skeptics in the parliament only fought him a little bit on the first loan, and then started registering future requests without complaint.

[(06:23)](#!):

Now, trying to figure out exactly what Necker was up to here is a little tricky. And though I haven’t got a good source on this, I would bet that he was interested in taking France in the direction of the British, who, when they created the Bank of England back in 1694, more or less invented the idea of a permanent national debt serving as an engine for growth. As long as the interest is being paid, the state would always have a ready supply of cash. This would help explain Necker’s bookkeeping without resorting to words like con artist, charlatan, and complete fraud. Because Necker started dividing royal expenditures up into two categories. Ordinary expenses and extraordinary expenses.

[(07:02)](#!):

As the loans piled up to fund the American war, Necker filed the interest on those loans as ordinary expenses. But he dumped the principal off into extraordinary expenses. He was happy to show anyone who asked the tally for the ordinary expenses, and with those apparently in good order, no one thought to ask about the extraordinary expenses, which would have sent potential lenders running for the hills, rather than happily handing over more money.

[(07:27)](#!):

The peak of Necker’s power, popularity, and influence, at least on this first go-around in the ministry, came in February 1781, when he convinced the king to let him publish for the first time ever a complete accounting of the royal finances. The resulting Compte-Rendoux was meant to silence all critics, and put to rest any whispers that all was actually not well in the king’s pocketbook.

[(07:52)](#!):

The Compte-Rendoux was a bona fide sensation, as nearly every educated man and woman in France wanted to get a look at the king’s books, I mean this was an unprecedented lifting of the veil. There were even mentions by later writers, who were children at the time, that they literally learned how to read from the Compte-Rendoux. It was seriously that big of a deal. And what did it show? It showed that the royal treasury had a 10 million livre surplus.

[(08:18)](#!):

But this was because the Compte-Rendoux only dealt with those ordinary expenses, the regular cost of government compared to the regular streams of revenue. But as I just said, things like, you know, the massive load of loans taken on to finance the war in America, were just not even mentioned. Had they been, all of France would have seen that the treasury was actually running deep in the red.

[(08:42)](#!):

In the long run, the legacy of the Compte-Rendoux was not just that it swept France’s financial problems under the rug, but that it became impossible to believe Necker’s successors when they revealed that the king was not only broke, he was catastrophically broke. I mean, how do you convince someone who literally learned how to read by flipping through the Compte-Rendoux that in less than five years the monarchy had somehow gone belly up? There were guys who right up until the end just couldn’t believe it, and thought that Calonne was running some sort of shakedown operation when he presented his reform package to the Assembly of Notables in 1787.

[(09:18)](#!):

In the short term, though, the Compte-Rendoux led directly to Necker getting himself kicked out of the ministry. Believing that he was now indispensable, he demanded that the king let him into the inner circle of decision-makers where he would resign. But like everyone in government, Necker had his enemies, and they convinced the king not to bite. His bluff called, Necker had to make good on his threat, and he resigned in May 1781. Though, critically for future events, his popularity with the public only grew as he was martyred by evil nobles who feared the influence of this commoner, who the people of France had come to believe could do no wrong.

[(09:58)](#!):

Necker was succeeded by a guy named Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Jolie de Flory, who was far more conservative in his outlook, coming from a staunchly anti-Enlightenment family. He’s not of major importance, and his name will not be on the test. But he was the bridge between Necker and Calonne, and so I have to mention that Flory took one look at the books and said, holy crap, we have got to raise taxes. And thanks to his long-standing connection to the parlement, he was able to push through a third vatienne that would run through 1786. But the additional money raised was only going to cover interest payments on all the previous loans. So just to keep going, Flory had to borrow even more money, and then go back to selling venal offices, a practice that had been slowly ratcheted down by previous ministries.

[(10:45)](#!):

Given what he had to work with, Flory’s days were always numbered. I mean, how do you ask courtiers and ministers to cut back on spending and submit to new taxes when the Compte-Rondeau is sitting on their desk, telling them that everything is fine? He finally called it quits in March 1783, just as negotiations to end the American war were getting underway.

[(11:06)](#!):

Flory was succeeded by a guy whose name will absolutely be on the test, Charles Alexandre de Calonne. Because it will be Calonne who will spark the so-called pre-revolution when he finally gives up the ghost and says it’s either major reforms or the kingdom collapses. Those are your options. Unfortunately, as we’ll see, Calonne was not a particularly good messenger for this dire warning, given his previous embrace of a little thing called useful splendor. So as we’ll see next week, when it came time for major reform, there was major pushback.

[(11:39)](#!):

Calonne had been born in 1734 in Flanders, into a respectable family of the robe nobility. He was trained as a lawyer, and then slowly rose up through the political judicial ranks, serving in the Flanders parliament, and then securing positions in the central bureaucracy, and eventually rising up to be an intended. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a man far more interested in nailing down his next promotion than really doing the job that was in front of him, but he was savvy in business, and at least clever enough to always land that next promotion when it became available.

[(12:11)](#!):

With the help of Foreign Minister Verg\xc3\xa8ne, who was by now Louis’s most trusted advisor, Calonne was brought in to serve as Controller General of Finances in November 1783, and he brought with him the rather novel idea that the best way to get out of debt was to spend more money. Now this is crazy, of course, and it didn’t work, but Calonne did have a plan.

[(12:32)](#!):

Like his predecessors, Turgot and Necker, Calonne believed that raising taxes was, at least for the moment, a political non-starter. His immediate predecessor, Fleury, had pushed the limits of the nobility’s patience by initiating the Third Vatiem. Anything more would require a concerted royal push that the Ministry did not have the stomach for, especially since it might eventually involve recalling the Estates General, which was a surefire way to completely lose control of the situation. So Calonne decided that the only way out was to keep borrowing, and hope that maybe in time new loans taken at lower rates would pay off the loans with the higher rates, and then they could start getting ahead of this thing. So instead of cutting back spending at Versailles, Calonne conspicuously jacked it up, the idea being that if creditors saw that the monarchy was spending lavishly, they would be assured that the king was in good shape, and see more royal loans as a safe investment. And for a while it worked, as Calonne took out hundreds of millions of livres more in debt. But even the useful splendor was not enough to quiet doubts. And in December 1785, the Paris Palomar balked at approving yet another loan, and they had to be marched as a group to Versailles, and basically ordered by the king to approve it. And so they did.

[(13:47)](#!):

But as you might guess, spending your way out of debt turned out to be not a very good solution to the problem, especially when Calonne took to the books to survey the situation now that Flores Vatim was set to expire at the end of 1786. He was mortified to discover that the crown was about to start running an annual deficit of well over 100 million livres, which was a full quarter of expected revenue, and it was only going to get worse as the interest started coming due for all the loans over the last few years. Once those started kicking in, something like half of all annual revenue was going to be going to debt servicing. This was a grind-the-wheels-to-a-halt revelation. Calonne realized that there could be no more tricks, no more kicking the can down the road. The crisis everyone had been trying to avoid for the last decade was finally upon them. And so he retired to his offices and started drawing up a plan to completely overhaul the crown’s finances. A plan that would touch on almost every part of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, a plan that would ruffle every feather in the kingdom, and a plan that the king would not be able to implement by his own royal will.

[(14:56)](#!):

But we’re going to leave the financial crisis there for the moment, on the eve of Calonne presenting his reform package to the king, because I want to close out today’s episode by getting into a royal scandal that would break just as all of this financial stuff was coming to a head. It is a scandal too crazy to just breeze by without stopping to smell all the delicious details. Plus, it offers the perfect opportunity to talk a bit about Marie Antoinette, who wound up losing whatever popularity she had left as a result of the scandal. Even though, as we’re about to see, she had nothing whatsoever to do with anything. So let’s talk about Marie Antoinette and the diamond necklace affair.

[(15:37)](#!):

Marie Antoinette was born Maria Antonia in 1755 in Austria. The eighth child and youngest daughter of Maria Theresa and Francis I, who were Holy Roman empress and emperor, respectively, and in that order, Maria Theresa, having inherited the throne from her father in 1740. Little Maria Antonia grew up in a fairly private and relaxed environment, and though she never took much to formal education, she excelled at singing and dancing and seems to have had a fairly happy childhood.

[(16:09)](#!):

But it just so happened that she was born right as Europe was undergoing the diplomatic revolution of 1756, which we’re going to talk about I think in two weeks when we pull back to survey the international scene within which the French Revolution is about to explode.

[(16:24)](#!):

The diplomatic revolution meant that Austria had a whole new set of partners it needed to cement alliances with, including its longtime enemy, France. It looked for a while like Maria Antonia wouldn’t be called upon to play a major role in the new alliance system, but smallpox took its toll on the Austrian royal family, and by the time she turned 12 in 1767, negotiations were underway with the French to marry her to the future Louis XVI, himself just 13 years old.

[(16:54)](#!):

All the arrangements over the dowry and whatnot were finalized over the next few years. Maria Antonia was restyled Marie Antoinette and shipped over to the custody of the French royal family, where she and Louis were officially married in May 1770. Now given that she was 14, and he was 15, and there was probably a roomful of people milling around, as was the weird royal custom, it is not surprising that the marriage was not consummated on the actual wedding night.

[(17:21)](#!):

But as the days, and then weeks, and then years passed, the missing act of consummation became a mild concern, then a running joke, and then a downright threat to the Franco-Austrian alliance. Not that many in France were much concerned about that. Though Marie herself was fairly popular in the early going, the alliance with Austria was most assuredly not. And that’s up to and including Foreign Minister Vergennes and King Louis himself, who both chafed under an alliance and marriage that had been arranged by their predecessors.

[(17:51)](#!):

So as the time passed, and Marie Antoinette continued to be ignored by King Louis, who preferred hunting and tinkering with locks, she took comfort with a small circle of friends, and indulged in whatever frivolities happened to present themselves. Shopping for clothes, gambling, horse racing, attention from discreet male admirers. She was, after all, basically still just a kid, and was only 18 years old when her husband descended to the throne, and she became Queen of France. This tidal bump changed little for her, though, including the constant barrage of letters from her mother berating her for not having bedded the king yet.

[(18:26)](#!):

A harsh spotlight hit this failure of royal intimacy when the king’s younger brother had a son in 1775, and by now the gossipy underground press was having a field day, and there were rumors that Louis actually had a physical defect that eventually required surgery to fix, though that seems to have been just a rumor. Finally, in 1777, Marie’s brother Joseph II, now Holy Roman Emperor, came to visit, and he was very much concerned about the state of the Franco-Austrian alliance. After badgering the couple to do their duty, the king and queen finally went to bed, seven years after they were married.

[(19:03)](#!):

But Marie Antoinette only enjoyed temporary relief from public mockery when their first child turned out to be a daughter. But then, in October 1781, she gave birth to the son everyone had been waiting for the last eleven years. Unfortunately, as we will see, the new dauphin, that is, the crown prince, was a sickly kid, and he would die at just about the worst possible moment in the spring of 1789. A few years later, though, the royal couple had a second son, who would also come to a miserable end at the hands of the evil revolutionaries, and then in 1786 a second daughter, who would not live to see her first birthday.

[(19:40)](#!):

Now through all of this, Marie Antoinette continued to spend money, buy property, push for her own favorites to be given offices and pensions and gifts, and her standing with the French public was not good at all. She was just too frivolous and extravagant and out of touch, and she took a constant beating in the press. But up until the diamond necklace affair, which we’re about to talk about, she may have been the object of scorn and mockery, but it wasn’t like she was hated. And what’s hilarious is that the thing that really got her hated was something that she had nothing at all to do with. Okay, so, the diamond necklace affair. Here’s how it goes.

[(20:21)](#!):

Way back in 1772, King Louis XV ordered an incredibly elaborate diamond necklace from a Paris jeweler. It was meant to be a gift for his mistress, Madame du Barry. But the piece was so complex that it was not completed by the time the king died, and Madame du Barry was kindly asked by the royal family to take a hike.

[(20:41)](#!):

The jewelers, now out the money they fronted to put the thing together, tried to sell it to Marie Antoinette in 1778, but she said no. It wasn’t her style, and she wasn’t too keen on Madame du Barry herself, so why would she want to wear her jewelry? After failing to sell the piece abroad, the jewelers again tried the queen in 1781, and again she said no. Okay, so far so good. There’s a fancy necklace. The queen doesn’t want it. Simple. But here’s where it starts to get complicated.

[(21:10)](#!):

Along comes a con woman named Jeanne de la Motte, who was successfully passing herself off as a descendant of King Henry II. At some point in 1784, she and her husband, an army officer who was also passing himself off as a noble, set their sights on fleecing the rich and hapless, and hopefully pronounced correctly, Cardinal de Rohan. Rohan was one of those wealthy aristocrats who made up the top level of the first estate, and he had once upon a time been ambassador to Austria.

[(21:41)](#!):

It was well known around town, though, that Rohan A. wanted a new position in the government, and B. was currently being iced out by the queen, who did not approve of Rohan reporting on her activities to her mother while the cardinal was serving as ambassador to Austria.

[(21:58)](#!):

So our con woman Jeanne takes up with the good cardinal, and convinces him that she’s developed an intimate friendship with the queen. Bait, the gullible Rohan could not pass up. Jeanne agreed to start delivering flattering notes from the cardinal to the queen, and then return with the queen’s replies. Replies that were, of course, forged. These forged replies were apparently affection enough in tone that Rohan started thinking maybe he and the queen had, like, something special. So he begged Jeanne to arrange a meeting. No problem, says Jeanne, and goes off, and I’m not making this up, to hire a prostitute who looked like the queen.

[(22:35)](#!):

On a moonlit night in the gardens of Versailles, Rohan and the fake prostitute queen met and promised to put all their bad blood behind them. Now, of course, while this is going on, Jeanne is routinely taking money from Rohan to invest in the queen’s charity work, which is a nice running scam, but then along comes the jewelers with the huge diamond necklace they can’t sell. They have just found out that Jeanne has got the queen’s ear, and they offer her a commission if she can get it sold. So in January 1785, Jeanne forges a request from the queen to have Rohan buy it for her. It would be too unseemly for me to go buy it myself, you see.

[(23:12)](#!):

Jumping at the chance to serve the queen, the cardinal arranges with the jewelers to buy the thing for two million livre to be paid off in four installments. He then takes the necklace and hands it off to the queen’s valet, who is of course just some guy in cahoots with Jeanne and her husband. Rohan is now absolutely giddy with the fine work he’s done, not even suspecting for a moment that the husband has just taken the necklace up to London, where he will strip it and start selling the diamonds off one by one.

[(23:40)](#!):

Eventually though, Rohan started to get nervous, and maybe a little suspicious, when he noticed that the queen had not yet worn the necklace, and still hadn’t sent any of the money to pay off the jeweler by the time the first installment came due in August 1785. When the payment deadline arrives, and Jeanne reveals to Rohan that there’s no money coming, the angry jeweler goes directly to the queen, and the queen says something along the lines of, I don’t know anything about this, and why are we still talking about this necklace?

[(24:10)](#!):

So the king and queen drag in Rohan for an audience, and demand an explanation. He tells them everything, and shows the forged purchase order, which sends King Louis into convulsions because it’s obviously a forgery, it was signed Marie Antoinette of France, and as Rohan full well knew, the royalty only ever signed with their given names. Permanently pissed off, the king has Rohan thrown in the Bastille. And from there, the whole plot unraveled, and everyone connected is hauled into court. Jeanne, the prostitute look-alike, the forger, the husband in absentia since he’s still up in London.

[(24:47)](#!):

The trials were a sensation, one of those trials of the century that come along every few years. But in a crazy twist, the public chose to sympathize with the defendants. Cardinal Rohan had been duped simply because he was too honest and eager. The prostitute was an innocent girl sucked into a sordid world. Even Jeanne was painted as a sympathetic noblewoman down on her luck who had been driven by poverty to make bad choices. Rohan it seemed was given a pass except the queen, who somehow came off as a vindictive harpy who had purposefully set the whole thing in motion to destroy Rohan, abscond with some pretty necklace, while all the while engaging in some fairly graphically depicted sexual manipulations.

[(25:30)](#!):

And the actual judges appear to have picked through all of this well enough, Jeanne and her husband were convicted, the forger was exiled, Cardinal de Rohan was acquitted, and the queen was found completely innocent. But in the all-important court of public opinion, the diamond necklace affair was devastating to the queens and by extension the entire monarchy’s reputation. And what was really damning was just how easy it was to believe that she was this rotten manipulative shrew who was all too eager to destroy anyone who stood between her and some shiny things.

[(26:02)](#!):

It was a devastating public relations nightmare from which she would not recover, especially because over the next few years she would not have an opportunity to recover. Things were about to go from bad to worse for the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime. And next week, the public will be hit with the great bombshell that had been kept hidden for so long. The royal treasury is exhausted, and unless drastic measures are taken, the entire kingdom is going to implode.

## 3.5- The Assembly of Notables

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.5 \xe2\x80\x93 The Assembly of Notables Dating the beginning of the French Revolution has always been a bit tricky. The most common and most famous is the storming of the Bastille in July 1789. That was when the political and economic crisis that had been mostly confined to the upper classes spilled out into a mob attack on a major symbol of the tyranny of the Ancien regime. But you might prefer to mark it with the Tennis Court Oath of June 1789, or the actual convening of the Estates General in May 1789. Or maybe you’d like to go back even further to the Noble Revolt and the Day of the Tiles in the summer of 1788. After all, that too involved a nice dose of mob action. But it’s pretty clear that the push that set this unbroken chain of events in motion is what we’re going to talk about today. Controller General Cologne’s announcement to the King in August 1786 that the state’s financial apparatus was broken and needed to be completely reformed. To quote him directly, he wrote, “…under present circumstances, with all the ordinary measures inoperable, the only effective remedy, the only alternative remaining, the only way to bring real order into the finances is to revitalize the entire state by reforming all that is defective in its constitution. As we will see, this blunt assessment will pave the way for everything else that is to come, and probably marks the real beginning of the French Revolution.” While I’m on the subject of dating, I’ve taken a few emails about this and realized that I’ve never explicitly said just how far I’m taking this thing. If I were to follow the logic of an unbroken chain of events, the answer would have to be like the Congress of Vienna that closed the book on the Napoleonic Wars in 1815.

[(02:01)](#!):

But though the Napoleonic era really is just an extension of the Revolutionary era, it has by then transformed into something very different, in the same sort of way that the Byzantines really are just the Romans by another name, and yet still something different. So though this will be a letdown for a few of you out there, we will not be plunging into the Napoleonic Wars. So that being the case, where do we draw a line between the Revolutionary era and the Napoleonic era? I think there are three good candidates. That’s 1804, when Napoleon crowned himself emperor, 1802, when Napoleon was made consul for life, and then the coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799 that brought him to power in the first place. I’ve seen histories of the Revolution end on all three. I’ve even seen them end as early as 1794 with the fall of Robespierre. But these days, I think a consensus has formed around the Brumaire coup of 1799. And that is where I am going to draw the line. Hopefully you’ve noticed by now that we’re going to be moving pretty slowly and methodically through every twist, turn, and beheading of the French Revolution. And so you won’t feel too cheated by the time we get to November 1799 and I say, okay, let’s get off the train.

[(03:11)](#!):

So, with that said, let’s return to the present. That is, the summer of 1786.

[(03:19)](#!):

As you will recall, Comptroller General Calonne had just spent the last few years engaging in a policy of useful splendor. I had bought him some time and some credit with the regime’s lenders. But with the most recent Vatiem set to expire at the end of the year, there could be no more papering over the regime’s financial troubles. With the bills now unavoidably coming due, Calonne and a small cadre of assistants set to work developing a reform package to revitalize the entire state. But Calonne made an early mistake by keeping the development of this reform package a secret. Only the king himself and a few select ministers knew what was going on.

[(03:57)](#!):

Now, given that for the moment Calonne had the full support of Foreign Minister Vergennes, who had emerged as the king’s most trusted advisor, he calculated that it would be unnecessary at this early juncture to bring everyone into his confidence. But Vergennes is about to die. And when the other royal ministers finally find out what Calonne has been up to, they will be pretty ticked off about having been kept in the dark, and feel not the slightest compunction about letting the Comptroller General and his reforms twist in the wind. Many indeed saw actively undermining Calonne to be their best play politically.

[(04:33)](#!):

Now, Calonne did not quite realize he would face resistance from inside the ministry. Probably in part because he was so focused on dealing with the inevitable resistance from outside the ministry. Specifically, resistance from the Paris parlement, where all of his reforms would eventually have to be registered. The parlement had laid low in the years after their battle with Lord Chancellor Mopu back in the early 1770s. But they had recently begun to make noises again. And as you’ll recall, they had tried to put their foot down after the king came looking for yet another loan at the end of 1785.

[(05:06)](#!):

Calonne was well aware that it would be impossible to register the package he was drawing up without a fight. And further, that it might be a fight that the king could not win on his own. The monarchy standing with the public was hitting new lows, especially with scandals like the diamond necklace affair swirling around. So what Calonne needed was some political cover to take the wind out of the opposition before it could really get howling. And he believed he would find it in an archaic council that had not been called since 1626. The Assembly of Notables.

[(05:39)](#!):

The Assembly of Notables was simply a gathering of the most elite nobles, clergymen, and civil administrators in the kingdom. Calonne figured that if he presented the reforms to the notables first and got them to approve it, which they surely would, that he would have a much bigger stick to fight with when he took it to the Paris parlour.

[(05:58)](#!):

King Louis, as usual, went back and forth about what to do. But in December 1786 was finally convinced by Virgin to go ahead and call the Assembly of Notables. It was set to convene at the end of January 1787, but the date had to be pushed back to February the 22nd because both Calonne and Virgin were laid pretty low by severe sicknesses and as the two strongest advocates of reform, both were obviously vital to the coming proceedings.

[(06:24)](#!):

But only Calonne would make it out of his sickness alive. Virgin, meanwhile, died on February the 13th, 1787. And going back for a second to the issue of how to date the beginning of the French Revolution, there is a little argument to be made that it all started with the death of Virgin because for the last 15 years he had been the one stable figure in the ministry, the only man who had provided anything resembling political continuity. When Virgin died, Louis lost his last political rock, and all the rival factions lurking around out there were each in turn able to exploit the king’s indecisiveness, resulting in destabilizing swings in policy that helped escalate the crisis every step of the way.

[(07:05)](#!):

For the moment, though, the death of Virgin meant simply that Calonne lost his most important supporter, and he basically had to go face the Assembly of Notables on his own. And it was not going to go well.

[(07:18)](#!):

So who are these notables? When you go through the list, it’s easy to see why Calonne thought he would be among friends. The 144 members of the Assembly included the Seven Princes of the Blood, 14 of the most influential Catholic bishops and archbishops, 36 great nobles, and then an array of hand-picked magistrates, deputies, and municipal leaders. This was a group built to defer to the king, support whatever he requested, and then go defend it publicly. Even the most radical among them, like our old friend Lafayette, who managed to finagle himself a spot, was expected to get in line after making a puffed-up speech or two.

[(07:56)](#!):

But what Calonne was about to discover was that these guys were not going to get in line. Though they would agree in general on the need to reform, they would resist him in almost every particular detail. Sometimes this resistance was driven by an enlightened public spiritedness that simply wasn’t convinced Calonne’s plan was the best plan. Sometimes it was driven by little parochial cliques who were happy to support any reform that didn’t touch their own special interests. But mostly, it was driven by the sense that now that successive royal ministries had driven the monarchy into the ground, it was time to start sharing real power with the aristocracy again. And clearly, someone needed to start exercising some oversight.

[(08:38)](#!):

Also working against Calonne was the fact that his own sickness had thrown the last few weeks leading up to the assembly into chaos. And it wasn’t until the last minute that the raw materials he and his assistants had been working from were finally cobbled together into something resembling a coherent plan. So though what he handed to the notables was pretty well thought out, it looked like a slapped together pile of half-baked improvisations that deserved and frankly demanded a thorough going over before it could be approved.

[(09:07)](#!):

But Calonne was not prepared for this level of scrutiny at all, as can be deduced from the blunt and rather imperious tone of his opening remarks. After dropping the bombshell that the monarchy was more than a hundred million livre in the red, Calonne inexplicably refused to open the royal ledgers to scrutiny, telling the notables that he had shown the numbers to the king, the king had approved the numbers, and that should be good enough for them. This naturally raised suspicions that he was cooking the books for his own purposes. His further claim that the comprendeux had been a total fraud was also taken as a self-serving ploy to blame Neckerre for deficits probably run up by Calonne himself.

[(09:46)](#!):

So clearly, these were not the actions of someone expecting the assembly’s deliberations to be anything more than a mere formality. I don’t think it even occurred to him that the notables wouldn’t approve the package, let alone that this would all lead to him getting kicked out of the ministry in disgrace.

[(10:05)](#!):

Okay, so let’s get into the guts of the thing. What Calonne presented to the assembly was a reform package divided into four sections. The first dealt with two major initiatives that were the keystone of the whole project. One, a uniform land tax, applicable to everyone, no exemptions. Two, the establishment of a network of provincial assemblies who would be tasked with assessing and collecting the tax.

[(10:31)](#!):

The second section covered an array of measures designed to stimulate the economy, because a healthier economy meant a healthier royal treasury. Advised by an old ally of Turgot’s, the second section was basically Calonne just adopting the physiocrat platform, so it was the abolition of internal customs barriers, setting up a single tariff on the frontiers, vastly reducing the burden of the hated salt tax, setting the grain trade free, etc. etc. etc. The third section covered the management of crown lands, which had been languishing badly from poor administration. And then finally the fourth section dealt with a grab bag of revenue and expenditure items that would demonstrate how the books would be eventually balanced.

[(11:13)](#!):

After the opening speeches, the assembly was divided into seven committees, each chaired by a Prince of the Blood. The plan was for these more manageably sized groups to meet separately, and spend about a week going over the first section, then everyone would get back together, review each committee’s considered opinion, and approve the thing. Then they would do the same with section two, and so on. The whole process was supposed to take about a month, and with the princes guiding the discussion and various ministers of state acting as recording secretaries, this should all go pretty smoothly, right?

[(11:45)](#!):

But as I mentioned, none of the ministers of state had any loyalty to Calonne, and only one of the princes, the Comte d’Artois, offered anything close to full support. Meanwhile, the Comte de Provence was actively, if secretly hostile, and the Duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans was actively and quite openly hostile. This was not going to be as easy as Calonne thought.

[(12:09)](#!):

But that said, when the committees took up the first section, the principle that a uniform land tax was necessary was surprisingly well received. These guys weren’t dumb, and they knew they were basically getting away with murder by not paying taxes on their land, and that sooner or later this exemption was going to have to end. But they weren’t too sure about the specifics of Calonne’s plan.

[(12:30)](#!):

What the Controller General wanted to do was divide land up into four categories, depending on how productive it was, and then levy a proportional tax in kind. That is, you would pay in wheat rather than money. The really progressive thing, though, was that the tax would be assessed on actual production, not theoretical production. So if there was a terrible harvest and your crop was wiped out, you would pay nothing.

[(12:54)](#!):

In theory, this was all well and good. Even if there was some quibbling over the details, might not the tax be assessed on net production rather than gross production? But then a much more substantive complaint emerged. And that was that Calonne was asking them to approve a new tax that was indefinite both in scale and time. Saying we need to raise X amount of money over Y amount of time was one thing, but saying we’re just going to collect an unknowable amount from you forever was quite different. And one notable went so far as to suggest that if that’s what you’re after, you’re going to have to call the Estates General to get it.

[(13:30)](#!):

But no one else was ready to get on board with that program just yet. What they did do, however, was refuse to approve the tax in kind, demanding instead that it be a money tax for a specific amount assessed each year to cover the deficit and nothing more. The other big innovation in the first section was also well received in theory, and that was the creation of provincial assemblies to assess and collect the tax. These assemblies would be built from the bottom up, in a series of tiered elections of landowners, but critically, no notice would be taken of the three estates. All landowners would be thrown into a single bucket. The notables, even a screaming liberal like Lafayette, thought that this went way too far. Increasing the representation of the third estate was fine, but to actually toss out the estates completely, I mean, that’s a bit radical, don’t you think?

[(14:20)](#!):

And this fit in with their further complaint, that far from being too strong, these assemblies looked like they were going to be too weak. Clearly, the notables were eyeing a new order where aristocratic-led provincial assemblies would start wielding real power, at the expense of what was obviously an incompetent central ministry. The last major complaint about the assemblies came from men representing the P\xc3\xa9-d’\xc3\xa9tat Generalit\xc3\xa9. These guys already enjoyed the right to call their estates provincial, a right that allowed them to negotiate better deals with the crown than subjects living in the P\xc3\xa9-de-L\xc3\xa9xion regions. Implementing this new system of provincial assemblies would level the playing field, and they weren’t much interested in that. So like I say, these complaints are kind of a mixture of enlightened self-interest and then just naked self-interest.

[(15:11)](#!):

A further source of tension when discussing the land tax was what to do about church property. As you will recall, the Catholic Church owned about 10% of all the land in France. So is that going to be taxed, or what?

[(15:23)](#!):

In short, the answer turned out to be that the Church would accept taxation on its land, as long as its right to collect tithes was not threatened. Unfortunately, they saw in Cologne’s further initiatives a complicated little wedge involving the liquidation of the Church’s debt that would do just that. Now I won’t bore you with those details, but I will use this as an opportunity to introduce one of the leading voices speaking for the clergy in the Assembly of Notables, and who also happens to have just been elected president of the Assembly of Notables, making him one of the leading voices speaking for everyone. Etienne Charles de Lom\xc3\xa9nie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse.

[(16:04)](#!):

Brienne was born in Paris in 1727 into a family with fairly decent noble credentials. He turned out to be a brilliant and ambitious young man, and entered the clergy as the best way to get ahead in life, though it was long suspected and I believe later confirmed that he was in fact an atheist, or at the very least a very skeptical deist. He was friends with Voltaire and Turco, and was deeply engaged in most of the social and political debates of the last days of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime. In time, he would also become one of the few high-ranking clergymen to abandon the pope and take the civic oath required by the revolutionaries, but that is for a few more episodes down the road. For now, he was about to emerge as the principal critic of Cologne’s plan in the Assembly of Notables, and then, when Cologne falls, his replacement in the Royal Ministry.

[(16:58)](#!):

Okay, so the debate over the first section had gone okay. The reforms were accepted in principle, but the details still needed to be worked out. But when the second section was taken up, everyone had a particular knit to pick, and almost all of these knits were about protecting some little exemption or privilege rather than broad-minded defenses of the public good.

[(17:20)](#!):

The major reform on the table was the abolition of all internal customs barriers, and the establishment of a single unified frontier tariff on imports. The benefits of this were obvious. It would make internal trade far more efficient, eliminate a major source of complaints about abuse from the tax farmers, and create a single border tax to help regulate international trade, hopefully with an eye on stimulating French manufacturing. Resisting these completely reasonable reforms were, for example, representatives from Lorraine and Alsace, frontier provinces who couldn’t care less about trading with their quote-unquote countrymen, but who cared deeply about maintaining free trade with neighboring foreign powers. Then there were representatives from the various coastal provinces who traded freely with the colonies, but who would now face a customs duty just like the interior provinces.

[(18:13)](#!):

Then there was the question of the salt tax. Obviously the tearing down of internal customs checkpoints would make different salt prices for different regions untenable, but that would leave 60 million livre annually to be made up, to say nothing of the fact that the tax farmers would not just sit quietly while the goose that laid their most golden egg was snatched away. So Cologne offered a fairly lame compromise that made everyone mad. Companies would collectively buy a set amount of salt at the required price, but everything after that would be purchased at market price.

[(18:49)](#!):

But this ticked off those exempt from the salt tax to begin with, who would now have to pay more, to say nothing of the fact that no one believed that the ruthless farmers who controlled the salt would ever let competition come in and undercut them. So really, this was just going to extend the tax to everyone without any marked benefit. So the notables followed the lead of Brienne in going even further than Cologne was willing to go, supporting the complete abolition of the salt tax and replacing it with a community-assessed money tax to make up the lost revenue.

[(19:21)](#!):

By now, it was the end of March, that is, when the assembly was supposed to have rubber stamped the last of the reforms. But they were only through two sections, and almost nothing had been unconditionally approved. Cologne was furious, and what he needed now was for the king to step in and appeal to that public spiritedness that did seem to exist at least some of the time. And tell the notables, I know every one of these reforms will hurt someone somewhere, but for the good of the kingdom, you need to get on board and stop the trivial complaining.

[(19:53)](#!):

But Louis XVI was not that kind of guy, and in the face of opposition, he hesitated. So Cologne was left to try to force it through on his own will, and he just didn’t have the juice. By now, the notables were pretty well sick of Cologne’s attitude, and Cologne was pretty well sick of the notables’ quibbling.

[(20:12)](#!):

In an ill-advised move, the controller general decided if he couldn’t get the king to pressure the assembly, he would get public opinion to do it. And he published a six-page defense of his program that accused the notables of dragging their feet just because they didn’t want to pay their fair share. Saying in an oft-quoted passage, People will pay more without doubt, but who will? Only those who have not paid enough in the past. They will pay what they owe, according to a just proportion, and no one will be overtaxed. Some privileges will be sacrificed, yes. Justice wills it, necessity demands it. Would it be better to overtax the nonprivileged, the common people? There will be great objections, that has been anticipated. Is it possible to work for the general good without offending some private interests? Is reform possible without complaints?

[(21:07)](#!):

Well the answer was of course no. But this did not go over well in the assembly at all, and only increased the amount of complaining. By the first of April, any pretense of civility between the controller general and the notables was pretty well dropped.

[(21:24)](#!):

As the third section was taken up, that is the one that dealt with administering the king’s domains, the notables seized on a recent shady land swap that greatly enriched some of Colon’s friends to push the idea that they completely agreed with the need for reform, but had now lost faith in the controller general personally. We just don’t trust him, and so it’s impossible to separate real reforms from the stuff just designed to line his own pockets. Brienne slipped a note to Marie Antoinette, summing up the general feeling that the sticking point was now Colon himself. If he goes, we can talk.

[(22:00)](#!):

Now the queen liked Brienne, and pretty much hated Colon, and so was all too happy to pass this message along to the king. This of course just sent Louis into further agonies, because he did like Colon personally, and had repeatedly given his assurances that he would back his controller general. But by now, Colon had no other allies left, and as would become his new favorite pastime, the king caved in to the pressure. On Easter Sunday 1787, Colon suddenly found himself dismissed from office.

[(22:35)](#!):

With Colon gone, calls went out almost immediately to bring back Jacques Neckerre, who had been so badly slandered by the unscrupulous Colon. Louis did not like Neckerre, but may have caved in right then to demands to bring back the Swiss Wonder Boy, but he had ordered Neckerre to keep silent while the assembly of notables were meeting to avoid stirring up trouble, and instead, Neckerre had just published a defense of his record two days after Colon was dismissed, making the king so mad, he exiled Neckerre from Paris. So instead, the king turned to a 68-year-old minister whose name I won’t even bother you with, because when the notables returned from the Easter break on April 16, they didn’t bother themselves much with him either.

[(23:21)](#!):

So finally, the king came down in person on April 23 to go over the fourth and final section, the one that would detail how the deficits would finally be closed. It was here that he announced he was caving to their demands on the land tax. It would indeed be recast as the notables had outlined, as an annual expedient limited in both duration and amount. He also said that to close the gap immediately, more short-term loans would be required, and then, in what would become something of a hot button down the road, that he would need to broaden the stamp tax on paper.

[(23:56)](#!):

But he also insisted that this was not a joke, and at Brienne’s suggestion, agreed to let the notables look through last year’s accounts to see for themselves the magnitude of the crisis, and imagine just how smoother this all would have gone had Calone simply done this in the first place. And speaking of Brienne, Louis then followed his wife’s advice, and agreed that the best way to repair the damage done by Calone was to elevate his most vocal opponent into the ministry and let the archbishop take the lead on pushing the reforms. After all, everyone agreed that Calone, not the reforms, had been the real problem. It was time to see if that was true.

[(24:36)](#!):

In Brienne, the king would find a minister who was serious about pushing through the reform package, much of which was kept intact from Calone’s original plan. But unfortunately, Brienne would be no more successful than his own rival in achieving fiscal salvation, especially once he went to war with the parlour.

[(24:56)](#!):

But we will leave that off for two episodes, because just as Brienne was coming into the ministry, a situation developed up in the Netherlands that seemed to demand a French military response, a response that Brienne was forced to conclude they could not actually afford, revealing for all of Europe to see just how weak the once mighty French had become.

## 3.6- The Stately Quadrille

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions, Episode 3.6, The Stately Quadrille. Thus far, we have been talking about the economic, political, and social frictions that were busy grinding Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime France to a halt at the end of the 18th century.

[(00:29)](#!):

But all of this was not happening in a vacuum. And throughout the course of the French Revolution, international politics and war will heavily influence the course of events inside France. And indeed, some, if not all of the major turning points of the Revolution are attributable to the fortunes of France beyond the frontiers. Or when things start going really badly, the fortunes of France within the frontiers. So this week, we are going to pull back and survey the political landscape of Europe so that we can have some kind of working understanding of everyone’s motivations when the Revolution and then the Revolutionary Wars begin to break out. Because one thing that is very clear is that those wars were not about brother monarchs getting together and waging war against the evil revolutionaries on behalf of the French royal family. It was a hell of a lot more complicated than that. But also, hopefully, a hell of a lot more interesting.

[(01:23)](#!):

So where to even begin? Let’s start with a gross oversimplification. On the eve of the French Revolution, there were five great powers in Europe. France, Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, and Russia. International politics in the 18th century was defined by shifting diplomatic and military alliances between these powers as each jockeyed for position. Which is where the label the stately quadrille comes from. The quadrille being a kind of popular four-person dance where everyone constantly switches partners.

[(01:57)](#!):

So what we’ll do here today is give a brief thumbnail sketch of each of the great powers and then pick them all up at about 1740 on the eve of the War of Austrian Succession. Which is as good a place as any to start tangling, disentangling, and then reentangling the pieces on the board.

[(02:14)](#!):

Now we can hopefully dispense with the British quickly since we’ve been talking about them pretty much non-stop here at the Revolution’s podcast. But just to run through it, you’ll remember that the policy of the early Stuarts had been to keep England out of the Continental Wars, and after the brief flip of Cromwell and his dream of a Protestant League, the later Stuarts pretty much maintained this low profile. But when the Glorious Revolution bequeathed unto England a constitutional monarchy able to mobilize the nation’s wealth far more efficiently than their autocratic cousins on the continent, England and then later the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Union of 1707, started a rapid naval and colonial expansion that forced the rest of Europe to pay attention. It is also around this time that the rivalry between the British and the French, which had been dormant for a while, began to pick back up in earnest, leading to what some historians have dubbed the Second Hundred Years’ War.

[(03:09)](#!):

But in the early going, the British rivalry with France was a little bit one-sided because the French were primarily interested in the next great power we need to talk about, and that is the Austrians. And talking about the Austrians is a little tricky, because really what we’re talking about is the Habsburg monarchy, which ruled a large composite kingdom centered around lands that conform to present-day Austria, with a capital in Vienna.

[(03:36)](#!):

The Austrian Habsburgs were a powerful force within the even larger Holy Roman Empire. If you thought Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime France was complicated, just try to pick your way through the Holy Roman Empire and its insane collection of little principalities and duchies, archbishoprics, free imperial cities, you name it, they’ve got it, and they all have their own rights, privileges and obligations to the larger empire. Technically, the Holy Roman Emperor was elected from among the various eligible princes. But from the mid-1400s, the Austrian Habsburgs had a mortal lock on the office, and the elections were there to simply confirm dynastic succession. Yes, it’s more complicated than that. No, we don’t need to get into it.

[(04:21)](#!):

And generally speaking, the central aim of French foreign policy since the Bourbons came to power back in the late 1500s was to contain the Austrian Habsburgs, a policy taken to its greatest extreme by Louis XIV, who spent practically his entire reign doing battle with the Habsburgs over just about everything, along the way forging a leapfrog alliance network with the Swedish, the Polish, and the Ottoman Turks to surround and contain Habsburg ambition. But after Louis XIV died, this alliance network began to break down. As the nascent Swedish Empire was broken, the Turks started to lose their edge, and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was about to become a feeding ground for its more powerful neighbors.

[(05:03)](#!):

And one of the big reasons this leapfrog network broke down was because of the rise of another great power, the Russians, who figured into no one’s grand plans until the great modernizer Peter the Great came along in 1672. There is even an old story, I’m not sure how apocryphal it is, that Louis XIV once decided to send a letter to the Tsar to see how things were going, and he addressed the letter to Tsar Michael, who had been dead for 12 years.

[(05:30)](#!):

The rise of the Russians led directly to the breakdown of France’s old alliance system. As they took down the Swedes in the Great Northern War, which lasted from 1700 to 1721, they pressed south into lands ruled by the stagnating Turks, and then eyed permanent hegemony over Poland. So though Russia was a long way away, and will not begin battling the French directly for some time, their moves had a big impact on French diplomatic calculations. And then of course, as we will see in a moment, it was the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War in 1787 that got the Austrians bogged down in the Balkans, which allowed the Prussians to push unchallenged into the United Provinces, which led to the crisis I mentioned at the end of last week that seemed to demand a French military response, and instead was met only with a we can’t afford to get involved.

[(06:21)](#!):

So finally, we come to the last and newest addition to our five great powers, the Prussians. Prussia had once upon a time been a Polish fife, but it became its own little sovereign duchy in 1660 in exchange for helping the Swedes during the Second Northern War. Then in 1701, the Elector of Prussia was allowed to crown himself king in exchange for supporting the Austrians in the War of Spanish Succession, and more generally supporting Habsburg hegemony over the Holy Roman Empire.

[(06:51)](#!):

But for the moment, the title was technically King in Prussia rather than King of Prussia because some of their dynastic lands were within the Holy Roman Empire. And within the Holy Roman Empire, you could only have three kings of something. King of the Germans, a title held by the emperor, King of Bohemia, also usually an imperial title, and King of the Romans, the official title of the imperial heir. Isn’t this all fascinating?

[(07:17)](#!):

So the Prussians started to rise in the early 1700s under the stewardship of Frederick William I, who initiated the military and bureaucratic reforms for which the Prussians are about to become famous. Once the baton is passed to that most enlightened and most despotic of our enlightened despots, Frederick the Great, his land armies are about to become rationally devised, organized, and drilled juggernauts that will become the envy of generals across Europe.

[(07:46)](#!):

Okay, so those are the major players of the 18th century. There were others out there, like the Spanish who were still a thing and connected by blood to the French Bourbons, but really, the main players are France, Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia. As you’ll notice though, only two of the five, France and Austria, were also major players in the 17th century. The other three, Great Britain, Prussia, and Russia, really just started taking off at the beginning of the century. The question on the minds of a lot of statesmen moving into the middle years of the 18th century was whether the two old powers would survive the rise of the three new powers.

[(08:25)](#!):

The Habsburgs would attempt to maintain their position by laying down systemic reforms to modernize their own lands in particular and the Holy Roman Empire more generally. It was a strategy that nearly destroyed them, but they managed to hang on. And of course the alternative was the path taken by France, which was to just sort of keep putting one foot in front of the other and hope for the best. But as we are about to see, the middle years of the 18th century will not be kind to France at all on the world stage.

[(08:54)](#!):

So in 1740, two major deaths paved the way for a new international order in Europe. First the King in Prussia, Frederick William I, and then the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI. These two deaths led directly to the War of Austrian Succession, which starts an international chain reaction that will eventually run right smack dab into the middle of the French Revolution.

[(09:18)](#!):

So the deal was that being the last surviving male Habsburg, Charles VI had been concerned about a succession crisis from the very beginning of his reign and had issued an edict way back in 1713 to make it possible for his daughter to inherit all the Habsburg possessions. So when he died in October 1740, his daughter Maria Theresa, Marie Antoinette’s mother remember, did indeed inherit the Nainastic holdings. But critically, she herself was not able to become Holy Roman Emperor. So every enemy the Habsburgs ever had came out of the woodwork to dispute her claims to power, most especially the new king in Prussia, 28-year-old Frederick the Great. Brilliant, ambitious, and ruthless, Frederick seized this moment to march in and grab Austrian-ruled Silesia. This sparked an international crisis that would soon lead to global war as the other great powers lined up on either side of the fight, France holding to its policy of containing the Habsburgs joined Prussia, as did the declining but still powerful Spanish. Meanwhile the British, mostly worried about checking the French, had already signed a treaty with the Austrians and lent money and troops to Maria Theresa to defend her family’s claim to the throne, as did the Dutch who, since their native son William had become King of England, were very tightly linked to the British.

[(10:38)](#!):

You got all that? Good. Because it’s all about to change. The war of Austrian succession went on until 1748, the main upshot being that Maria Theresa’s claims were validated and her husband was elected Holy Roman Emperor, though everyone knew where power really lay, Frederick the Great kept his hold on Silesia, and perhaps most important, none of the belligerents were particularly satisfied with the conduct of their nominal allies. So when the treaty that ended the war turned out to be merely a temporary truce between the Austrians and the Prussians, when they got back at it a few years later, everyone had a new set of partners.

[(11:17)](#!):

So that brings us to the thing I’ve hinted at a few times now, and that’s the diplomatic revolution of 1756. The British had apparently been impressed by Prussia’s performance during the war, and were now convinced that the Prussians, rather than the Austrians, represented the best counterweight to France. So in January 1756, they promised not to provide aid to Austria if Frederick made another play against Habsburg lands.

[(11:43)](#!):

Maria Theresa had already concluded that the price of friendship with Britain was much too high. They had all but forced her to recognize the Prussian claim to Silesia. And so after concluding a defensive pact with Russia, she turned to the longest standing enemy of her family, France, for assistance.

[(11:60)](#!):

Louis XV was not super inclined to accept these Austrian overtures. The Franco-Austrian rivalry was deep and bitter. But holy moly, was there anything scarier than the thought of having to fight the combined strength of the British navy and the Prussian army all alone? No. So in May 1756, the two longest standing rivals in Europe, the Austrians and the French, signed a treaty of mutual defense. Frederick then invaded Saxony, sparking the Seven Years’ War.

[(12:32)](#!):

Now we’ve talked a little bit about the Seven Years’ War, as the North American theater of that war figured so heavily into the lead up to the American Revolution. The crazy intricate details of this truly global conflict are too much for us to get into here. But the key result was that Prussia and Austria, the two central belligerents, wound up signing a treaty in 1763 restoring the status quo antebellum, that is, the way things had been before the war started. The big winner of this war, then, was the British, who won big at the expense of the big loser, the French, who were forced to cede their North American possessions after getting kicked around on the continent, on the high seas, and in the colonies.

[(13:13)](#!):

Once again, though, the Seven Years’ War left all the belligerents kind of ticked off at their supposed allies. Frederick the Great felt personally betrayed by the British during the treaty negotiations, the Austrians were appalled at the performance of the French, and the French blamed the Austrians for dragging them into a war over Silesia that wound up gaining Austria nothing while costing France both her North American colonies and her international prestige. Right at the end of the Seven Years’ War, though, there was a major political turnover in one of our five great powers that led to further diplomatic upheavals. Until 1762, Russia had been allied with Austria and France against Britain and Prussia.

[(13:56)](#!):

But then the old Tsar died, and the new Tsar, who greatly admired Frederick the Great, switched sides. This helped salvage the situation for the Prussians, but it also helped the new Tsar get himself overthrown by his wife Catherine, herself soon styled The Great. She switched Russia back to the Austrians as the Seven Years’ War wound down. But after all the treaties were signed in 1763, she decided to abandon Austria and forge an alliance with Prussia, forming a northern league linking Britain, Prussia, and Russia against Austria and the much-hobbled French.

[(14:32)](#!):

Then Catherine revealed herself to be as ambitious a monarch as any in Europe, and started to push the Russian border south at the expense of the Ottoman Turks. This she achieved during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774, which put the rest of Europe on edge when it came to the question of Poland, because somehow the question of Poland winds up explaining a lot about what everyone was really thinking when revolutionary France starts getting belligerent in the early 1790s. Okay, so, Poland.

[(15:05)](#!):

The deal with Poland is that it used to be something, and now it really wasn’t. It was politically divided and not keeping pace with its neighbors. So as the 18th century progressed, it became more and more of a Russian protectorate. Flushed with victory over the Turks and sick to death of the near-continuous unrest inside Poland, Catherine looked to snuff out any hint of Polish independence and just annex their territories outright.

[(15:30)](#!):

Meanwhile, the other two central powers, Prussia and Austria, looked to Catherine’s ambitions in Poland as a way to lay the foundations for a new balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe. Prussia was interested in keeping the Turks healthy and available for another potential war against Austria, and the Austrians were now completely freaked out by the rise of Russia and believed, not unjustly, that their entire eastern flank was exposed. So the three great powers started talking amongst themselves, and agreed that everyone would be best served by divvying up Poland. Everyone would get some new territory, no one would challenge the other’s claim, and for the moment they could all take a break from fighting and consolidate their new holdings.

[(16:11)](#!):

So they pulled out a map, divided up what amounted to about a third of Poland’s total territory, and then simultaneously invaded in 1772 to occupy their newly-claimed lands which the fractious and weak Poles could not hope to defend. It’s called the First Partition of Poland. There will be two more partitions, leading to the obliteration of a sovereign Poland in 1795, that is, right in the heat of the Revolutionary Wars.

[(16:39)](#!):

So the next big turning point in the European game of power politics was obviously something we’ve talked out quite a bit around these parts. Because while the Continental Powers were dividing up Poland, Britain was in the midst of bungling away its North American colonies. In France, this bungling coincided with the death of Louis XV and the ascension of Louis XVI, who brought with him the man who would be his foreign minister and eventually most trusted advisor for the next 14 years, Verg\xc3\xa8ne.

[(17:08)](#!):

Now we’ve been talking about Verg\xc3\xa8ne for a while now, going back to the end of the American Revolution, but I underestimated just how much I would be talking about him, and so never gave him the treatment he probably deserves. So just in time for him to die, here is the life and career of the Comte de Verg\xc3\xa8ne.

[(17:28)](#!):

Verg\xc3\xa8ne was born in 1712, and he joined the French diplomatic corps practically right out of the nursery. He started his career attached to an older relation, and together they were posted to Portugal, tasked with keeping the Portuguese from ever siding with the British. Then they hopped east as the War of Austrian Succession wound down to try to keep the enemies of Maria Theresa fighting, but in this they were obviously unsuccessful.

[(17:52)](#!):

Verg\xc3\xa8ne then got his own posting to the city of Trier in 1750. He tried to prevent Maria Theresa’s son Joseph from being named King of the Romans in 1752, that is, the imperial heir, but again he was unsuccessful, though not entirely unsuccessful, because he was able to help open up a rift between the Austrians and the British that would eventually lead to their divorce. After that, he was sent to Constantinople in 1755, where he would serve as ambassador to the Turks for the next 12 years.

[(18:23)](#!):

Now while in Constantinople, the diplomatic revolution of 1756 hit, and with it the Seven Years’ War, and it was left to Verg\xc3\xa8ne to explain to the Sultan why Austria is now our ally, and please please please don’t attack them.

[(18:38)](#!):

With the humiliating peace of 1763, Verg\xc3\xa8ne was ordered to do everything in his power to get the Turks to attack the Russians, but he couldn’t get it done in time to save his job, and he was recalled in 1768 after losing favor back in Versailles. But just as he was sailing away, the Turks did indeed go to war with the Russians, this being the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774 I just mentioned that saw the Turks get knocked around, making the Prussians and Austrians super-nervous and super-ready to go partition Poland. Verg\xc3\xa8ne was back in Versailles’ good graces, though, by 1770, and he was posted to Sweden where he helped French-aligned Swedes pull off a neat little coup d’etat.

[(19:21)](#!):

When young Louis XVI ascended to the throne in 1774, Verg\xc3\xa8ne was brought back to Versailles, an appointed foreign minister, a post he would hold for the next 14 years. During these years, he revealed himself not much impressed with the current order of things, but also at kind of a loss about what to do about it. He wanted to check the growing power of Britain and Russia, and had no use whatsoever for the Austrians, but any potential move seemed like it was going to make the situation worse.

[(19:51)](#!):

Then in 1775, he was presented with what appeared to be a golden opportunity in North America. Crazy colonial tax protesters had decided to try to take on the entire British military, and Verg\xc3\xa8ne was all too willing to help them do it. He convinced the king it would be worth it, and then had a hand in getting Turgot kicked out of the ministry for pointing out that they probably couldn’t afford it. But Verg\xc3\xa8ne’s master plan to humble the British by helping detach their North American colonies did not wind up paying off as much as he hoped, especially after the Americans went behind his back and negotiated a separate treaty with their ex-mother country.

[(20:31)](#!):

In the end, the American War of Independence turned out to not utterly disable the British, while simultaneously playing a huge role in creating the insurmountable deficits that would utterly disable the French.

[(20:44)](#!):

But for the moment, it did leave France in a strengthened position, and guiding an anti-British alliance that now included the Spanish and the Dutch. To keep this position, however, Verg\xc3\xa8ne believed that the French would have to keep its military spending more or less at war levels. The idea that you could mobilize for a limited war, and then demobilize after the resulting peace, was no longer operative. To keep up with the other European powers, the French military had to be kept permanently ready to fight. This wreaked havoc with the royal treasury, because as first Neckerre and then Calonne tried to tap dance their way around the financial crisis, they had both assumed that once the American War ended, as it did in 1783, the king would not have to spend so much on his army and his navy. But Verg\xc3\xa8ne convinced Louis that this was impossible. So rather than clearing all of that spending off the books, it just stayed put.

[(21:39)](#!):

But Verg\xc3\xa8ne matched this permanent state of military readiness with an initiative that he hoped would actually reduce tensions between France and Britain, and with luck stimulate the French economy. This is the Eden Treaty of 1785, named after the lead British negotiator. It was in essence a free trade agreement between the two kingdoms, that in theory would give the British a market for their surplus manufacturing, and the French a market for their surplus agriculture, most especially wine.

[(22:07)](#!):

The new principles of international free trade embedded in the treaty were supposed to benefit both sides. But apparently the British negotiators like, ran circles around their French counterparts. The upshot was that British goods started flooding into France, and rather than stimulating domestic competition, instead just started to wipe it out. And these losses were not at all made up for by whatever extra cash they got from selling wine up to Britain. So you can add to the massive load of grievances piling up in the 1780s the Eden Treaty, which was pretty universally despised by every Frenchman.

[(22:42)](#!):

So that pops us out basically where we left off last week, and we’ll end today with the crisis that devastated France’s international reputation, and made the other powers wonder if France might not be the next Poland. Okay so it’s the spring of 1787. France is engulfed in a financial crisis. While this crisis is unfolding, two big international events, one very close and one very far away, will conspire to expose just how weak France has become.

[(23:15)](#!):

The first erupted a couple thousand miles away, when the Russians and Turks went to war, leading directly to the Austrians and Turks going to war, because FYI around 1781 Catherine the Great had grown tired of her Prussian alliance, and signed Russia back up with the Austrians because the dance just goes round and round and round.

[(23:35)](#!):

But then, at that same moment, just up the road in the Netherlands, the United Provinces were dealing with a domestic crisis of their own, a little growing civil war to be exact. One that in some ways anticipated the revolution in France, and in other ways was completely different. But one thing that was about to become clear is that France had an interest in the outcome of that growing little civil war, indeed they had a side they were openly supporting, but they would not be able to do a thing when oh let’s say the Prussians decide to come marching in.

[(24:10)](#!):

Okay so ever since William of Orange became King of England, the British and the Dutch had been pretty closely aligned. Indeed one of the most consistent goals of British diplomacy was maintaining their ascendancy in the Netherlands, both to prevent the French from having convenient ports to launch a direct invasion of the home islands, but also because the Dutch had a pretty great merchant fleet, and controlled a string of bases all the way to India and beyond that were critical to Britain’s growing trade empire.

[(24:36)](#!):

But over the course of the century, the political makeup of the United Provinces began to change, as the power of the House of Orange was challenged by men who would soon enough be calling themselves the Patriots. These guys pushed for an even more Republican Republic, and the de facto elimination of the stadtholder’s power, what with it being a feudal anachronism and all.

[(24:58)](#!):

The French were all too happy to support the Patriots, and when they started gaining control of the Dutch government, the Patriots were only too happy to support the French. This is, for example, how they wind up in the anti-British coalition during the American War of Independence. After the war, the Patriots muscled out the Orangists to the point where a formal treaty was signed with France in 1785, which as you can imagine, was fairly alarming to the British. In the mid-1780s, clashes between the French-supported Patriots and British-supported Orangists became more acute. The Patriots started mustering their own independent militias, and civil war appeared to be brewing.

[(25:36)](#!):

The flashpoint finally came in June 1787, when the stadtholder’s wife, the Prussian Princess Wilhelmina, was captured by a Patriot militia company, and not necessarily treated with the respect due to a princess.

[(25:50)](#!):

The British saw in all of this an opportunity to evict the Patriots, and restore the power of the Orangists, but they did not have the requisite forces to do it themselves. But guess who did? That’s right, the Prussians. Now for decades, Prussia had declined to do anything about the drift of Dutch politics towards a French orbit. Though the British and Prussians were allies, Frederick the Great calculated that in the Netherlands, no great Prussian interests were at stake, and getting involved would only mire them in a war with the French, who very much had a national interest in stake. Plus, Frederick recognized the natural ostrophobia of the French might eventually make them a key ally, so he saw no reason to step on their toes in Holland.

[(26:32)](#!):

But Frederick the Great died in 1786 after 46 years on the throne, and power passed to his son Frederick William II, who was not quite the man his father was. And he decided, what the heck, let’s get into it. Partly to avenge the honor of his sister Wilhelmina, and partly to set the stage for a new age of Prussian expansion, the new king decided to invade the United Provinces. So in September 1787, in they went, and to everyone’s great surprise, the Prussians, the British, the suddenly all on their own Dutch patriots, the French did not lift a finger to stop them.

[(27:10)](#!):

Now Brienne was probably right about France not being able to afford a war with the Prussians up in the United Provinces. But no matter how right he was, this was deeply embarrassing for France, and the Minister of War and the Minister of the Navy resigned in protest. It also estranged the monarchy from basically their entire officer corps, who cared little about account ledgers, but an awful lot about French honor. It was also a huge signal to everyone both inside and outside of France that something was deeply wrong, and the king was in real trouble.

[(27:43)](#!):

But if you think that this made them want to lend a hand to a friend in need, you have not been paying attention, and out in London, and Berlin, and Vienna, and St. Petersburg, men began to dream of a France-less Europe. But we will leave them to dream, and next week we will turn our attention back to the reaction inside France, and watch as Brienne tries to push through the Paris parlement, the reform package that will hopefully save the kingdom from ruin. But if you think the Paris parlement had any interest in lending a hand to a friend in need, then you really haven’t been paying attention.

## 3.7- The S\xc3\xa9ance Royale

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions Episode 3.7 The Science Royale Last week we stepped away from the financial crisis that was busy rocking the Ancien regime to take a look at the wider world of international politics, diplomacy, and war that the French Revolution was about to explode into the middle of. And as I kind of suspected would happen, in trying to mash that much information into that small of a box, I flubbed a few details along the way. So we get to start with two quick corrections. One from listener Joe. When I was talking about the major political turnover in Russia at the end of the Seven Years War, I should not have said, then the old Tsar died. Because it was not some dude who died at the end of 1761. It was, in fact, the Empress Elizabeth. My apologies to Empress Elizabeth for confusing her with some dude.

[(01:06)](#!):

Second, as a number of listeners pointed out, Frederick the Great had no children. Of course he had no children, it’s actually a whole little sub-chapter of Prussian history all its own. So I should have said that his successor, Frederick William II, was not quite the man his uncle was, because Frederick William II was Frederick the Great’s nephew, not his son. Though, while I’m here, I may as well throw in that Frederick William II will get to style himself King of Prussia, rather than King in Prussia, because his uncle, Frederick the Great, did arbitrarily assert a preposition change round about the first partition of Poland.

[(01:46)](#!):

Okay, so getting back to the main story. We left off two weeks ago with the ousting of Controller General Calonne from the Royal Ministry after he failed to convince the Assembly of Notables to approve his reform package. Taking his place, sort of, was the Archbishop of Toulouse, Lom\xc3\xa9nie de Brienne. Having established himself as one of Calonne’s most vocal critics in the Assembly of Notables, Brienne was brought into the Ministry in May 1787 in the hopes that he would be a more effective advocate of reform than the politically condescending Calonne had been.

[(02:22)](#!):

I say Brienne only sort of took Calonne’s place, because Brienne was not appointed Controller General. That job went to a historical non-entity you don’t need to worry about. Brienne was instead appointed head of the Royal Council of Finance. The Royal Council of Finance was an old ministerial committee that for as long as anyone could remember had been filled with ceremonial appointees who never really met as a group and who wielded no power.

[(02:49)](#!):

But the pushback from the Assembly of Notables led to the revival of the Council as a real institution, the idea being that the Royal Finances needed broader oversight than had been provided by the previous string of secretive and despotic Controllers General. So though it is correct in spirit to say that Brienne succeeded Calonne, just remember that his position is head of the Royal Council of Finance, not Controller General. But for the moment, this was as far as the King was willing to go when it came to increasing oversight.

[(03:22)](#!):

The Notables, however, emboldened by their ousting of Calonne and the placement of their own man inside the government, wanted still more. They wanted assurances that if they approved the reforms that deficits wouldn’t come back. They wanted annual publication of the King’s expenses. They wanted more of a say in who sat on the Council of Finance, or better yet, they wanted a totally independent auditing committee who would be tasked with assisting a Controller General. But the King was reluctant to commit to anything that would diminish his majesty, and he refused to give in to these new demands. This led to a protracted back and forth through May 1787 that went nowhere fast. The Notables were willing to improve new temporary loans, but they were clearly not going to accept any of the major reform initiatives. Public opinion had started to factor into their deliberations, and they were relishing in their role as defenders of, you know, whatever.

[(04:19)](#!):

On May the 21st, the Marquis de Lafayette gave voice to the rising call to reconvene the Estates General, it being the only institution that could truly exercise oversight over the monarchy. And listening to all of this, Brienne decided that though he had just recently been one of its leaders, the Assembly of Notables had now outlived its usefulness. It had been called to give the King political cover, and all it was doing now was obstructing his will. So Brienne announced that he was going to go ahead and take the reform package, dutifully modified to reflect your suggestions, to the Paris Parliament for immediate registration. And on May the 25th, 1787, the Assembly of Notables was disbanded. It was time for the real fight to begin.

[(05:05)](#!):

The magistrates of the Paris Parliament, of course, had been sitting on the sidelines just waiting for their chance to get into the game. And now that the Assembly of Notables had refused unconditional support, and Calonne had been driven from the ministry in disgrace, they were basically jumping up and down and saying please please please put me in coach. After their showdown with Chancellor Mopu back in the early 1770s had left them weak and divided, they now recognized this as a golden opportunity to get the upper hand on the King. Of the leaders inside the parlour, I will note two in particular, one a fiery arch conservative, the other a young liberal noble. Their political leanings would naturally take these two men in opposite directions once the parlour stopped being the center of attention. But for now, they fought on the same side.

[(05:56)](#!):

The fiery arch conservative was Jean-Jacques Duval de Premenil. Raised in Paris and trained in the law, de Premenil entered the parlour as a young counselor, just as it was being brought back to Paris after the fall of Mopu in 1774. The young lawyer quickly established himself as one of the most eloquent and passionate defenders of the traditional rights of the parlour, earning him enemies at court, especially when he gleefully jumped into the middle of the diamond necklace affair and used it as an opportunity to rail against the Queen in particular and the monarchy in general.

[(06:31)](#!):

But though this cast him as one of the principal opponents of the Bourbon dynasty, he was no radical liberal and certainly no revolutionary. He railed with equal vengeance against the whole long tradition of the Enlightenment. His entire life and career was dedicated to establishing the preeminence of the aristocracy, and he believed that in the current crisis the role of the parlour should be to obstruct whatever the king proposed, forcing him to call the estates general, which would naturally be controlled by, and serve the ends of, the nobility.

[(07:04)](#!):

His ally in the fight against the royal ministry was a young lawyer who came at the crisis from a completely different trajectory. This was 28-year-old Adrien Dupour. Dupour was not the orator de Premenil was, not by a long shot. But he saw clearly that the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime was dying and that the kingdom needed a new constitution that would bring France into the modern age. He was an admirer of the American Revolution and was associated with Lafayette and believed that the estates general had to be called, and that their job should not just be to approve new taxes, but also to draft this whole new constitution for France.

[(07:43)](#!):

But critically, Dupour was a liberal noble, not some crazy liberal republican. The aristocracy could and should play a major role in the new political order, but not as courtiers who led on the basis of old privileges, but rather as citizens who led by virtue of their education, experience, and superior merit.

[(08:05)](#!):

After the assembly of notables was dissolved, the Paris Parlement convened in a special session to await the king’s attempt to register the reform package. This special session was called a Court of Peers, which was nothing more than the members of the Paris Parlement being joined by the Seven Princes of the Blood and a few other high-ranking nobles. Even in the case of this particular Court of Peers, that meant that 21 men who had served in the assembly of notables now sat in the Paris Parlement.

[(08:35)](#!):

But that little detail is not nearly as important as the other new twist in the fight. Because when Brienne started presenting the reforms for registration, the resulting debate did not occur in a private room closed to the public. There would be, for the first time, an audience. In the early going, this audience was drawn primarily from the 2,000 or so clerics and bailiffs and young lawyers who were attached to the workings of the parlement and for whom this debate was the center of the universe. Mostly younger and mostly liberal and or radical, they cheered speakers who preached resistance and hissed at those who advised compliance.

[(09:14)](#!):

The existence of the audience will soon become a key feature of the French Revolution, which is in pretty marked contrast to the English and American Revolutions, where all the great oratory was directed at fellow members of parliament or the Continental Congress. But the leaders of the French Revolution always had a crowd to play to, and the impact of turning governance into theater would play a major role in how things would unfold.

[(09:44)](#!):

When Brienne started presenting the reforms at the end of June 1787, though, he started with the easy stuff. Items that were sure to be registered without a fight, including turning the corv\xc3\xa9e into a money tax, establishing free trade in grain, and the creation of provincial assemblies to assess and collect the new taxes. This was all mostly non-controversial stuff for the members of the Paris parlement, though as we will see next week, the bit about provincial assemblies would find much stiffer resistance in the provincial parliaments, who were not too keen on some kid horning in on their turf.

[(10:19)](#!):

But the Paris parlement finally started pushing back on July 2nd, when Brienne brought in the proposal to enlarge the scope of the stamp tax. The stamp tax was loved by the ministry for the same reason it was hated by the parlement. Its burden would primarily fall on the upper classes, rather than the poor peasants, whose life did not revolve around paper the way it did for, say, merchants, bankers, and lawyers. As the magistrates rose one by one to denounce the stamp tax, more than a few of the younger liberals delighted in getting to rehash the very same arguments made by the daring American revolutionaries who had so bravely stood up to the tyranny of King George over this exact same issue.

[(11:03)](#!):

The tactic that the parlement used to fight the extension of the stamp tax was to delay registration until the king sent along his detailed plan for how the royal books would be kept in the future. They didn’t want to approve a new tax just to watch it all disappear into Marie Antoinette’s jewelry collection, pause for laughter and applause. The king refused, and pointed out that this was way beyond anything the parlement had a right to demand. Then the magistrates pointed out to the king that technically what he was asking them to do was way beyond what he had a right to demand. On July the 26th, they issued a remonstrance calling on His Majesty to withdraw the stamp tax and convene the Estates General.

[(11:45)](#!):

Brienne decided not to press the issue, and he did pull back the stamp tax. But that was mostly because the stamp tax was small potatoes compared to the other big revenue initiative that needed to be registered, the universal tax on land. You know, the linchpin of the whole project. Brienne had modified the land tax to be for specific monetary amounts determined annually, rather than Cologne’s endlessly rising tax into infinity. But even with this modification in place, on July the 30th, the parlement flat out said no, we cannot register this, it’s a new tax, and new taxes mean you have to call the Estates General.

[(12:25)](#!):

But everyone knew that the king’s next move would not be to call the Estates General. Instead, it was clearly time for a good old-fashioned lie de justes, which as you’ll recall was that unbeatable constitutional trump card held by the king. On August the 6th, the Paris parlement was called as a body up to Versailles for the ceremony of forced registration. On the hottest day of the year, some 400 magistrates and ministers packed into a hall at the palace of Versailles to hear the king’s official statement that in his estimation the reforms were necessary, and so he was registering them by his own royal will.

[(13:04)](#!):

Unfortunately for the monarchy’s public relations department, the official ceremony of the lie de justes involved the king being seated on a bed of pillows, don’t ask. And while the ceremony unfolded, you know the one where he was forcing through edicts critical to the survival of the monarchy, the king fell asleep. He started snoring. Guys had to like raise their voices to be heard. It was hot, and it was stuffy, and he was sitting on a bed of pillows, but still, Louis, man, have a cup of coffee.

[(13:39)](#!):

When the parlement reconvened the next day in Paris, they immediately went back on the attack and bluntly declared that the previous day’s lie de justes to be an illegal usurpation of power. Then Adrien Dupour opened up a major broadside on former controller General Calonne, holding him responsible for the criminal mismanagement of the royal treasury. Calonne, exiled to Lorraine, did not like the sound of these accusations one bit, and quietly slipped over to England, making him arguably the first \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 of the French Revolution.

[(14:12)](#!):

He planned to stay abroad until the heat was off, and did try to come back when the Estates General got called the following year, but by then he was a reviled public whipping boy and forbidden to return. He would wind up attaching himself to the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 court of the Comte d’Artois, and then when the Revolution just kept going, he resettled back in London. He would not return to France until 1802, when Napoleon let him back in just in time to die a month later.

[(14:40)](#!):

But Dupour’s attacks on Calonne were not about attacking Calonne, they were about attacking the King. And to the continued cheering of the audience, D\xc3\xa9pr\xc3\xa9menil, Dupour, and their colleagues declared their outright refusal to execute the King’s illegal edicts. The King, as you can imagine, was not amused. On August the 14th, every member of the Paris Parliament was handed an individual Lettre de Cachet, ordering them to leave the radically energized Paris and reconvene in the sleepy town of Troyes.

[(15:15)](#!):

A Lettre de Cachet was simply a signed order directly from the King, and it could be used for all kinds of things. But one of those things was delivering penal judgments that could not be appealed, as in you are now exiled to Troyes, leave immediately.

[(15:31)](#!):

Lettres de Cachet were hugely unpopular, and pretty high up on everyone’s list of tyrannical abuses that needed to be reformed, as in the King shouldn’t be allowed to do this anymore. But for the moment, it had the force of absolute law. The magistrates left Paris and reconvened at Troyes, far away from the adoring audiences they had been playing to, and removing them from the salons and clubs where they had been urged nightly to continue resisting the King.

[(15:59)](#!):

The exile of the Parliament was met by protests from a few of the lesser courts around Paris, and also by a few street demonstrations, though we’re talking about dozens of people here, not thousands. It was enough, though, for the King to order regular armed patrols through the streets of Paris, and then further, the closing of all those private clubs where men and women had met to chat about current events. And at this point, I am contractually obligated to mention, as every historian does, that the chess club was among those closed, which indicates just how sweepingly paranoid the King was becoming.

[(16:36)](#!):

On August the 26th, Brienne was officially elevated to the post of principal minister, and though he too was obviously annoyed at the parliaments and transigents, he decided it was time to start walking back from whatever brink they were all approaching. He took no action against the lesser courts for their shows of solidarity, and then he started sending conciliatory letters to the parliaments to arrange a compromise.

[(17:00)](#!):

Now I’ve seen this compromise described as both Brienne exercising shrewd political judgment and totally caving into pressure. And I gotta say, I tend towards the latter because the basis of the compromise is that the King would withdraw the land tax, collect the existing Vatim more rigorously, and then take out new loans to cover any shortfalls. It’s hard to see this as anything but a complete cave-in. He basically gave up everything he had been previously fighting for.

[(17:31)](#!):

The parlement was of course amenable to this compromise, and after spending a month bored out of their minds in Troyes, on September the 13th they accepted the deal, though they reaffirmed in no uncertain terms that they would never register a new tax. A week later, they were recalled to Paris, where they were met by cheering crowds, fireworks, and a nice big bonfire where Cologne was burned in effigy. It was good to be home. But though this compromise satisfied the magistrates of the Paris parlement, it scared the bejesus out of the regime’s bankers. The expected land tax was basically the thing that had been holding them at bay.

[(18:11)](#!):

But Brien somehow managed to talk his way through it, and pointed out that though the projected deficit for 1788 was a cool 160 million livre, most of that was for loan repayments that would then be coming off the books. By collecting the Vatim more efficiently, revenue would go up over the next few years, while costs came down. So yes, we’ll need to take out a few more annual loans until we hit equilibrium about five years down the road, but every year the size of the loan will drop, until we’re out from under this thing. The bankers were still understandably nervous, but when Brien refused to commit troops to the United Provinces to fight the invading Prussians, which is happening right now, temporarily bumping the battle between the king and parlement off the front page, that kind of brutal fiscal reasoning had to ease their minds a little bit. Even if the rest of France was utterly scandalized.

[(19:08)](#!):

Now the parlement took a much needed vacation after returning from exile, so it wasn’t until November that they reconvened to register the loans that would be necessary to make Brien’s fiscal compromise work. But by now divides were starting to open up amongst the magistrates. The older conservatives were happy with the compromise and willing to register the new loans Brien requested, but the younger liberals felt betrayed. They believed that this had all been about pushing France in a new direction, not falling back into old habits.

[(19:39)](#!):

Brien soothed them by recommending to the king that the estates general be called at some point in the next five years, calculating of course that by then the crisis would be passed and the estates would simply get together, say good job, and then go home. But a funny thing happened on the way to the compromise. The king totally went off script right in the middle of it, like literally right in the middle of it.

[(20:05)](#!):

On November the 19th, 1787, the king came down in person to convene the parlement in a sience royale, a royal session. And this was not a lie de justice. There wasn’t any ceremonial hoopla, the king was not sitting on a bed of pillows, and it was not about forced registration. This was simply the king attending a session of the parlement. As part of the non-hoopla, the magistrates were told that they could speak their minds freely, and a few of them did, some maybe a little too freely for the king’s taste. But still, all seemed like it was on track, and Brien believed that they had the votes to approve the loans.

[(20:45)](#!):

But then just before the votes were counted, the king suddenly veered off track. Possibly influenced by a reactionary minister who whispered something in his ear. Possibly that the vote was about to go against his majesty, and boy that would be embarrassing. The king suddenly spoke up and said, okay, these loans are necessary, I’ve promised to call the estates general, my words should be sufficient for you, so I order you to register the edicts.

[(21:12)](#!):

The magistrates were taken aback. With this stunning turn hanging in the air, the duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, the one prince of the blood who was well and truly estranged from the court at Versailles, got up and stammered an objection, saying that the king’s actions were illegal. But Louis dismissed him, and said it is legal because I will it. Then he got up and left.

[(21:36)](#!):

The magistrates looked around at each other in confusion, and decided to continue the session, agreeing that the king was at this point way outside of his prerogatives. The next day, the king ordered a leche de cachet against Orl\xc3\xa9ans, and two of his associates, exiling them from Paris. Then he ordered the parlement to send him a delegation at once, with the registration he had ordered in hand. And as much as they hated it, there was little they could do but comply. Then the king expunged the record of the Ciance Royale to eliminate all record of resistance to his will.

[(22:11)](#!):

This royal session was supposed to mark the end of the conflict, or at least a temporary truce. And instead, it kicked everything up a notch. If King Louis had hurt his position by falling asleep during the lie de justice back in August, he positively wrecked his position by staying awake for the Ciance Royale. In immediate response to all of this, Adrien Dupour opened up proceedings on the legality of leche de cachet, resulting in a January 4 remonstrance to the king that they needed to be abolished. The king took no notice.

[(22:48)](#!):

Over the winter, the fight really moved out into the provinces, because just as the disastrous Ciance Royale was being held in Paris, the various provincial assemblies that the Paris parlement had approved way back in June started to meet. But obviously, given the resulting political antagonism, the character and direction of these assemblies became hot-button issues out in the provinces.

[(23:12)](#!):

But I’m going to hold off on talking about that right now, so I can finish up this round of fighting between the king and the Paris parlement. Because when that round ends with the promulgation of the May edicts, the fight will move decisively out into the provinces, and we can start next week’s episode with a little catch-up rather than trying to cram everything in here today. So the final showdown of this particular round of fighting in Paris came in April 1788.

[(23:41)](#!):

Rumors had begun to swirl that the king had grown so tired of the parlement’s carping that he planned to break them by force, and everyone started bracing not for polite exile, but for an outright royal coup. The widespread belief that they were about to be attacked led them to launch into even deeper and more bitter attacks on the despotism of King Louis XVI. The legality of November’s Ciance Royale was called back into question, and on April 17th, a large delegation traveled to Versailles to present the king with their complaints \xe2\x80\x94 complaints that were simply rejected out of hand.

[(24:17)](#!):

So on April 30th, de Premenil crafted a major remonstrance, laying out the legitimacy of a Montesquieu-style constitutional monarchy and the illegitimacy of whatever the hell King Louis thought he was doing. In a further decree on May 3rd, called the Declaration of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, de Premenil stated flatly that the right to levy taxes lay with the Estates General and the Estates General alone \xe2\x80\x94 an institution that had now been seized on as a panacea for all that ailed France.

[(24:49)](#!):

Louis responded by digging even deeper into his royal prerogatives, known as rank despotism to everyone else. Lettres de Cach\xc3\xa9 were issued on May 4th against de Premenil, and another guy, whose name I won’t bother you with \xe2\x80\x94 I wish the other guy had been Adrien Dupour, it would have made this a much neater little story, but King Louis does not seem to care about making it easier for me to explain this stuff to you. On May 5th, the two men sought refuge inside the parlement itself, and for the whole day a standoff ensued. The magistrates refused to hand over their two colleagues to the king’s men, and the king’s men were hesitant about just barging in and grabbing them.

[(25:29)](#!):

But after a day of noble resistance, the parlement agreed to hand the two men over. They were arrested and then imprisoned on May 7th. The very next day, the royal ministry issued the famous May edicts, and that is what we are going to talk about next week. Designed to break utterly the parlement now and forever, the May edicts will instead spark a backlash throughout the kingdom that will lead directly to the king’s decision to convene the Estates General not at some point in the next five years, but right away \xe2\x80\x94 specifically in May 1789.

[(01:19)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.8. The Day of the Tiles Last week, we saw the Royal Ministry and the Paris Parliament battle over the big financial reform package that had been cooked up to save the kingdom’s bacon. After accepting a few of the initial offerings, the Parliament then rejected the main pieces of the puzzle, leading to a series of showdowns between the summer of 1787 and the spring of 1788. To many an outside observer, it looked like the Parliament was gaining the upper hand \xe2\x80\x94 they had forced the king to withdraw the stamp tax and stopped pursuing the land tax \xe2\x80\x94 and were riding high on a wave of public acclaim. But the king’s ministers were not yet ready to just give up completely, and this week we will see them make one last push to assert the king’s will in the face of Parliament’s obstructionism. Their solution? Destroy the Parliament.

[(02:25)](#!):

But before we get into that, I want to backtrack a little and briefly cover the reaction of the Provincial Parliament to Brienne’s reforms. Because though Paris was the center of the action, there was lots of noise being made out on the periphery that will have a huge impact on what will happen in today’s episode. So let’s wind back the clock to June 1787, when Brienne first started bringing in the reforms to the Paris Parliament.

[(02:52)](#!):

As you will maybe recall, Brienne started with what I called the easy stuff \xe2\x80\x94 turning the corv\xc3\xa9e into a money tax, that seemed fine. Lifting regulations on the grain trade, which will, I can promise you, be hated by the lower classes. But remember, we’re still talking about the uber-elites here. They saw a more rational and more profitable system and said, yeah, let’s do it.

[(03:13)](#!):

Then finally, the magistrates accepted the creation of provincial assemblies to assess and collect taxes. Now this breezed through the Paris Parliament, who had little to fear and much to gain from these new assemblies. In most of the areas under the jurisdiction of the Paris Parliament, tax collection was all handled by the royally appointed intendents and the much despised tax farmers, so injecting a new institution composed of the wealthiest taxpayers, like, you know, us, was a welcomed evolution of power.

[(03:43)](#!):

But in the outer provinces, where the parliaments already enjoyed a great deal of autonomy, these new assemblies did not look to the local magistrates like more power was being given to them, but rather that power was being taken away. They were further incensed when they saw the specifics of the plan \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, that there were no specifics. The edict they were presented with was vague about both the jurisdiction and the scope of the new assemblies. Plus, the order came with a really suspicious kicker.

[(04:15)](#!):

Because the assemblies needed to get to work right away, and it would take too long to set up the whole tiered process of lesser taxpayers electing greater taxpayers to go represent them, the first members of the assemblies would be, wait for it, appointed by the king. In this, the provincial parlomah smelled a big, fat, hairy rat. Complaints about the provincial assemblies were drawn up by the several regional parlomah with varying degrees of intensity, usually arguing that the ministry was doing an end run around the long-established political constitution of France.

[(04:50)](#!):

But more than that, they were also just kind of opposed to the whole idea of tax reform in the first place. Up until now, we’ve been talking about the royal ministry, the assembly of notables, and the Paris parlomah. And in each of those three places, we’ve seen men either resign to, or openly pushing for, a new tax system. So for the first time now, we’re actually hitting on some nobles who were flat out against giving up their tax privileges. These provincial nobles were not these super nobles living in Versailles and Paris. They actually relied on their land to make up the bulk of their often meager income, rather than enjoying rich, diversified portfolios. To say nothing of the fact that if this kept up, there would be very little to mark them out as special. Those tax privileges were a social calling card that they were not prepared to give up.

[(05:42)](#!):

Of the parlomah that resisted the creation of the provincial assemblies, the one that needs to be highlighted right now is the parlomah of Bordeaux, Montesquieu’s old stomping ground. They were the political and judicial hub of a fairly prosperous port city that had long enjoyed a great deal of autonomy. In July 1787, they issued a remonstrance back to the king saying that they refused to register the edict establishing the new provincial assemblies until the jurisdiction and scope of those assemblies was clearly laid out, which for the moment, really wasn’t.

[(06:15)](#!):

They were stiff enough in their resistance that when the Paris parlomah was exiled in August 1787, the Bordeaux parlomah was given the boot too. Lecher de Cachet exiled them from the regional capital for the small town of Libourne. But unlike their brother magistrates in Paris, the exile did not make them amenable to a compromise, it only made them matter. So when the Paris parlomah was recalled in September, the Bordeaux parlomah stayed in exile. They would not be allowed to return home until just before the May edicts were issued, which were designed to make them irrelevant.

[(06:51)](#!):

Despite the resistance though, the provincial assemblies began to convene in November 1787 just as the king was going off script in the middle of that royal session we talked about last time.

[(07:01)](#!):

As I mentioned, this first batch of assemblies were indeed appointed by the royal ministry, so the entire apparatus was obviously suspect. But just how suspect came down to how strongly the members actually favored the king. Because not everyone in the assembly was a staunch royal ally, there just weren’t enough of those guys to go around. Some of the members were there to do the king’s bidding for sure, but others wound up full of guys like for example the Marquis de Lafayette, who were eager to steer the assemblies in the direction of independent-mindedness, and most especially, serving as yet another stage to advocate for the calling of the Estates General.

[(07:41)](#!):

With Brienne having dropped the land tax as a part of his compromise with the Paris parlomah, the one order of business the assemblies really had to haggle over was the extension and collection of the Vatim, which was supposed to once again help bridge the royal deficits. But where Lac’s collection had long been the order of the day, the Vatim was now supposed to be pursued with an unprecedented vigor. So over the winter of 1787-1788, the royal ministry, the provincial parlomah, the intendents, the provincial assemblies, all waged a running battle with each other over who owed what and for how long, and of course the big question, who now outranked whom?

[(08:23)](#!):

The parlomah still wanted assurances that the taxes would have to be duly registered before the assemblies could set to work collecting them. The assemblies generally ignored this and just went to work, but more than a few got to work simply so they could drag their feet and force the king to call the Estates General. Meanwhile Brienne threatened to go back to arbitrarily assessing and collecting the Vatim if the assemblies didn’t get in gear, and then another flood of angry remonstrances from the parlomah would come pouring in. As the spring of 1788 approached, this mess needed to be simplified. So Brienne’s ministry decided to cut at least one tangle out of the knot by just taking the parlomah out of the equation.

[(09:02)](#!):

It was as audacious a move as Chancellor Mopu had made back in the early 1770s, if not more audacious. For Brienne and his colleagues, the hope was that when they were done, the parlomah \xe2\x80\x94 the self-proclaimed defenders of French liberty \xe2\x80\x94 would be turned into an insignificant social club. The setup for this came at the end of last week’s episode when rumors started flying around in April 1788 that the ministry was about to make a really serious move. This resulted in even more heated rhetoric coming out of the Paris parlomah, and then the arrest of de Premenil and that other guy.

[(09:38)](#!):

Then on May 8th, the wild rumors were confirmed by a sweeping series of decrees that basically gutted the power of the parlomah. Known as the May Edicts, these decrees set up a new plenary court that would be staffed by high-ranking nobles. This new plenary court would become the institution where all future taxes and legislation would be registered and become the court of final appeal for almost all criminal and civil cases. All that was left to the parlomah were cases involving sums over 20,000 livre, and a few other estate and contract issues that affected only the richest men in the kingdom.

[(10:16)](#!):

In one bold stroke, the ministry was trying to reduce the parlomah to little more than an arbitration council for the super-rich. All real power and authority would be transferred to the plenary court. And as if this wasn’t shocking enough, Brienne further planned to create lesser courts over the next few years to replace the existing hodgepodge of weirdly overlapping jurisdictions. If all went according to plan, France would shortly have an entirely new judicial system, and the parlomah would become relics of a bygone age.

[(10:49)](#!):

Now Brienne was of course expecting some resistance. But it seems pretty clear that he underestimated just how widespread that resistance would be. The king’s principal minister was no doubt thinking about the parlomah as they truly were. Little enclaves of aristocratic privilege cared little about the general welfare.

[(11:08)](#!):

But by now the parlomah had morphed into something far greater in the public imagination. It would appear that all their bloviating about protecting the ancient liberties of France was actually being taken seriously. The parlomah were for the moment the one institution in the kingdom who could resist the king’s will and then send him remonstrances explaining why. So when the king tried to abolish the parlomah, well as we’ll see in a minute everyone from the highest noble to the lowliest fishmonger had something to say about it.

[(11:37)](#!):

Although as we will also see, when the magistrates of the parlomah noticed that the unwashed masses were jumping into the fight, they will get really super uncomfortable. Because when we said we were the defenders of liberty, we meant our liberty you dummies, not yours, oh crap that one’s got a brick, let’s run for it. So what this led to in the summer of 1788 was a series of protests, demonstrations, and riots that knocked the ministry back on its heels. And it all got started almost immediately after the May edicts were announced. First of all, the parlomah were collectively put on vacation, whereupon almost the entire legal profession went on strike in protest. The wheels of justice ground to a halt.

[(12:19)](#!):

Unlike last time when Mopu was able to incise ambitious young attorneys into the new system though, Brienne found almost no takers. The solidarity of the legal community was for the moment unbreakable.

[(12:32)](#!):

But though they had been ordered to disperse, not all the parlomah were willing to just go away without a fight. Some dispersed quietly after a token remonstrance or two, but once again, those on the periphery of the kingdom elected the path of stiff resistance. When for example, the local intendant came to prevent the parlomah of Wren from meeting, he was met by an angry mob of such size and force that he was forced to flee, and whatever authority the monarchy had in Brittany was basically lost for a good two months.

[(13:02)](#!):

But the most famous incident happened down in the city of Grenoble, the traditional capital of the province of Dauphine, down on the edge of the Alps. When the authorities there attempted to disperse the Grenoble parliament, what they got was the Day of the Tiles. The Grenoble parliament had outright called the May edicts illegal, and so Brienne ordered them exiled from the city. Lettres des cachet were issued and due to be delivered June the 7th, 1788. Now the problem, delivering the exile orders on June the 7th, was that it was a Saturday \xe2\x80\x94 aka market day.

[(13:41)](#!):

That meant that Grenoble was full to the brim with people who were already a bit agitated over rising bread prices and lack of work. The closure of the parlomah would mean that Grenoble would take yet another economic hit. So all morning speakers railed against the injustice of it all, and around 10 a.m. everyone shut up their stalls to get down for a little direct action. One group went to the Palais Royale to prevent the magistrates from leaving. A second group went to the city gates to ensure the same. And then a third group convened at the governor’s house and basically laid siege to it.

[(14:16)](#!):

The authorities had on hand two regiments of soldiers to try to quell the unrest. But torn between the twin evils of attacking unarmed civilians and letting anarchy reign, they opted for a halfway measure that just made everything worse. Soldiers were dispatched in small groups to establish a presence, but told not to fire on the demonstrators. The effect of this was to make it look like the protesters were about to be attacked while leaving the soldiers totally outnumbered and without any means of protecting themselves if the people started to get out of hand. Now most of the troops managed to hang tough and not fire into the unruly crowds. But one group near the Jesuit College building found itself pelted by debris from all sides, then pelted with roof tiles from the building above. When they actually started getting hit, it was much too much, and they started firing into the crowd.

[(15:11)](#!):

This of course only confirmed to everyone in the city that they were indeed under attack, and they rang the toxin bells, which drew in even more men and women from the countryside. The authorities then tried to cut a deal with the magistrates of the parliament and say, look, we’ll pull back if you just leave the city. The magistrates of the parliament said, yeah, well, that sounds awesome, but unfortunately we’re not really in control anymore. We’re frankly as freaked out by all of this as you are, but the mob, as you can see, has unbridled all the carriages and is now manning the gate.

[(15:42)](#!):

But after peeking with a good old-fashioned ransacking of an official’s house, the demonstrators slash rioters started to naturally disperse as the sun set, at which point almost all the magistrates of the Paris parliament re-bridled their carriages and got the heck out of town.

[(15:60)](#!):

The day of the tiles represents the first major incursion of the mob into our story, and served as a rather stark wake-up call to the parliament that they were toying with Pandora’s box here. Remember, for the most part what they wanted was to keep things the same, but they found themselves now seized on as a vehicle for those who wanted change. And now all of a sudden these lower-class yabbos who had no business being anything but anonymous plebs were violently getting in on the action. For the moment, these anonymous plebs were defending the parliament as the people’s champion, but how long could that possibly last?

[(16:38)](#!):

Spoiler alert, it will last until about September. But though most of the magistrates of the Grenoble parliament were disturbed by the day of the tiles, one guy saw it all as an opportunity to capitalize on the exposed weakness of the royal authorities to demand more than just the continued existence of the parliament. That man was 30-year-old Jean-Joseph Meunier. Meunier was a wildly successful young judge, ennobled at the age of 25 after buying himself a place in the Grenoble parliament.

[(17:11)](#!):

But despite his success, he was a forward-thinker and clearly wanted more than to just rise up the old judicial hierarchy, both for his own sake and for the sake of France. So he was the mastermind behind a movement to get the Dauphin\xc3\xa9 Estates Provincial recalled, a necessary first step in what would hopefully become a wider movement to establish a sound constitutional monarchy for France. Though he was out in front of events for the moment, Meunier would remain committed to the dream of a constitutional monarchy even as events swept by him. As we’ll see, he’ll enter the Estates General as one of the most influential and genuinely recognizable members, and then resign from that body less than a year later, unable to reconcile himself to the pace and direction of events. Then branded as a reactionary, he will be forced to slip away to Switzerland in 1790. The French Revolution moves fast, but that is all still in the future.

[(18:11)](#!):

For now, Meunier was in his prime. On June 14, a week after the day of the tiles, he organized a meeting of about 100 prominent men representing each of the three Estates. At Meunier’s urging, the group endorsed a call for the restoration both of the parlement and for the convening of Dauphin\xc3\xa9’s Estates Provincial.

[(18:31)](#!):

But by far the most critical aspect of this meeting is that it gave the first formal expression to an idea that would soon sweep the country, that when the Estates met, as they surely must, the number of the Third Estate’s representatives should be double that of the other orders, so the composition would wind up being 50% clergy and nobility, and 50% Third Estate. And then critically, that voting should be by head rather than by order.

[(19:01)](#!):

This maxim of double the Third, vote by head, would become a major rallying cry in the lead-up to the Estates General. And when the issue still hadn’t been resolved when the Estates finally meet in May 1789, well, you’ll see what happens when we get there. While he waited for word from the Ministry about whether the Dauphin\xc3\xa9 Estates would be allowed to meet, Meunier simply plunged ahead as if they were going to say yes. Word went round Dauphin\xc3\xa9 for everyone to prepare for the calling of the Estates Provincial, and to convene a preliminary assembly at a chateau in Visio.

[(19:37)](#!):

Starting on July 21st, this assembly was composed of 50 clergymen, 165 nobles, and 276 representatives of the Third Estates. Meunier got himself appointed secretary, and then guided the debate into unprecedented territory. Though he was not a great orator, his arguments carried enormous weight.

[(19:58)](#!):

Instead of making the case for parlour and the Estates on the basis of the old constitution, he went back even further than that into the primordial ooze, and started bringing up points about natural law, the rights of man, and the necessity of true liberty. These were concepts that had been floating around for years among the philosophs, but they were now being mainlined directly into the body politic. Then he went further, and said that no convening of the Estates Provincial or the Estates General could be considered legitimate if it was not convened on the basis of double the third and vote by head, and anyone who opposed that idea was a traitor to France.

[(20:39)](#!):

And now we’re talking revolutionary language, because man, once these guys grab hold of the notion that political opponents are actually guilty of treason, boy watch out. Meanwhile, back up in Paris, King Louis was of course vacillating like crazy. He had come down hard with the arrest of de Premenil and the May edicts, but the size and scope of the pushback shocked him. For a minute, he tried to keep up the tough guy act. A group of Bretson nobles were thrown in jail for meeting under vaguely seditious circumstances, and then a delegation on the way from Rennes to ask for their own Estates Provincial was arrested. But a week later he backed down, and suddenly agreed to let the Breton Estates meet. Then on August 2nd, he more or less accepted the legitimacy of all Meunier’s activities by allowing the Dauphine Estates to meet as well.

[(21:32)](#!):

Now if you will recall from way back when, the big problem with King Charles I was that he wouldn’t listen to anyone. He was so insanely inflexible that he basically forced Cromwell to cut off his head. In this respect, Louis was the opposite. He was so flexible that he just couldn’t stick with any one policy. He was one of those guys who will just go with whatever the last person who talked said. This was starting to become a problem for the monarchy, and Marie Antoinette and the King’s brothers started talking amongst themselves about how they were worried Louis might not be up for this.

[(22:09)](#!):

The Queen then started taking a more forward role in policy to protect the interests of the royal family. But unfortunately, all of this royalist entrenchment did was create an even more extreme position for Louis to jump back and forth from when the Estates General finally met. The bottom finally fell out of the Ancien Regime on August 8th, 1788. That was when Brienne was informed that there was only 400,000 livre left in the royal treasury. Barely enough to keep the lights on for a single day, and no one would lend them any more money. The ministry was forced to admit defeat.

[(22:47)](#!):

Scrapping the plan to replace the parlour with the plenary court, Brienne announced that the meeting of the Estates General would no longer be at some vague point in the future. He announced that on May 1st, 1789, the Estates General would convene at Versailles for the first time in 175 years. This announcement was met by wild euphoria throughout the kingdom, as everyone had come to believe that basically all their hearts desired would be granted by this now almost mythical assembly.

[(23:19)](#!):

In a move that looked shrewd to Brienne at the time, but wound up really sowing the seeds of true revolution, the King then invited public debate on the form the Estates should take. This was supposed to drive a wedge between the nobility, who would insist on going by the old three equal estates, vote by order, and the commoners, who were already on record opposing anything but doubling the third and voting by head. It did indeed drive a wedge between them, but the resulting rupture did not lead to the King regaining his political footing. It opened up instead an unbridgeable chasm that would eventually cost the King his head.

[(23:60)](#!):

But though the call to convene the Estates General was for sure necessary to satisfy the King’s creditors, it was not sufficient. The regime needed loans to get them through until May 1789, but as had happened with Cattelone, Brienne was now personally becoming a sticking point. On August 16th, with credit exhausted, Brienne cut off repayment of loans, and started issuing pieces of paper for the amounts due plus 5% interest, collectible at some point in the future. This was not a satisfactory response, and Brienne knew it, but there was little he could do. Beaten, tired, and now well aware that the regime’s bankers were opposed to him personally, he resigned on August 25th. He had spent 16 months trying to get somewhere, anywhere, and instead got himself nowhere and the kingdom officially on the road to revolution.

[(24:58)](#!):

With Brienne out of the picture, there was only one man the bankers would accept if the monarchy expected to see even a single Livre, and that was of course the Swiss wonderboy Jacques Necker. As much as the King hated it, he was forced to choose between Necker and Necker because there was no other choice. The news that the now-hated Brienne was gone and the people’s banker Necker was being recalled set off yet another wave of jubilant celebration across the kingdom. This is all going fantastically, don’t you think? And now we get to have a great debate over how our estates should be composed, I mean, this really is the dawning of a new era.

[(25:36)](#!):

And next week, we will dive into the dawning of that new era. With freedom of the press all but declared, France would be flooded with newspapers and pamphlets and diatribes, all trying to influence public opinion and sway the future of France. It was exhilarating, intoxicating, and ultimately would prove totally uncontrollable.

[(01:19)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.9. What is the Third Estate? We left off last time with the de facto bankruptcy of the French monarchy in August 1788. The short-term consequences of this bankruptcy was that it forced Principal Minister Brienne to suspend his attempts at financial and judicial reform, officially call for the convening of the Estates General, and then resigned from office.

[(01:58)](#!):

The longer-term consequences are almost incalculable, because this is what leads directly to, you know, the French Revolution. The median-term consequences, though, are really interesting, because as we’ll see in today’s episode, the state’s bankruptcy represents a pivot point in the political contest that had been waged since 1786, when Controller General Colon had first revealed the terrible state of the Royal Treasury. Because up until now, this political contest had been waged among the elite, between the Royal Ministry and the Assembly of Notables, and then, more spectacularly, between the Royal Ministry and the Parliament.

[(02:36)](#!):

But by the end of today’s episode, the aristocracy will cease to be the leading edge of political agitation, giving way, unwillingly of course, to the rising leadership of the Third Estate, who will today be invited into the political process for the first time. But before we can get into that, we need to briefly plot the trajectory of another really big missile that is about to slam into the side of the political crisis, and that is, of all things, the weather. Mother Nature decided that just for fun, she would ravage French agriculture just as the political structure of the Kingdom was teetering on the brink.

[(03:14)](#!):

Now the big picture climate-wise was that from about 1550 to 1850, the Earth, or at least the Northern Hemisphere, went through something called the Little Ice Age, basically a prolonged period of cooler temperatures. This Little Ice Age was punctuated by three especially cold dips, the first beginning in 1650, the last beginning in 1850, and the second one, the one we care about, beginning in 1770. These climate fluctuations played hell with traditional farming expectations, and almost certainly played a role in sparking the Flower War that we talked about back in Episode 3.3.

[(03:51)](#!):

Compounding this problem was the Great Laki Eruption of 1783 up in Iceland. Unfolding over months, the Laki Eruption pumped out enormous clouds of poisonous gas, wreaking havoc with the global atmosphere, killing livestock and crops, and leading to widespread famine. But despite these ongoing climate problems, in 1785 France enjoyed a pretty bountiful harvest that once again gave encouragement to the market reformers who followed in Turgot’s footsteps, like for example, Calonne, Brienne, and the Paris parlement, who all agreed that lifting regulations on the grain trade would help solve the fiscal crisis. And so, as we saw, that’s what they did in 1787. But of course, the harvest of 1787 was not especially good. And so, just as with the Flower War, the market reforms only jacked up the price of bread and set the lower classes to fuming.

[(04:46)](#!):

In normal times, bread used up anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of an urban worker’s total income. Now, it was climbing to the point where it was more like 60 to 90 percent. And naturally, this bloating of the bread prices reduced everyone’s disposable income if they had any to begin with, which sent shockwaves through the burgeoning consumer economy and leading to economic slumps in places like Lyon, where soon something like 20 to 30 thousand silk workers would be left idle. Or, for example, the glove manufacturers of Grenoble, who also found themselves equally low on work, and thus really, really motivated to keep the Grenoble parlement from being dispersed since it was the one stable economic engine the city had left.

[(05:31)](#!):

Now, we won’t know whether the harvests of 1788 were shaping up to alleviate the problems caused by the harvests of 1787 because on July 13, 1788, the whole north of the kingdom was ravaged by a devastating hailstorm, like softball-sized hailstones that pummeled crops right into the ground. The grain supply was already short and now it was going to get shorter, and all leading into the winter of 1788-89, which everyone was about to find out would be the coldest winter on record.

[(06:04)](#!):

Luckily, with the cost of bread alone now using up the entire household budget, there would be nothing left over for other food, lighting, or heat. So it was into this volatile atmosphere that the king was about to invite the entire kingdom to take part in a mass airing of grievances, because there’s nothing quite like firing someone from their job, starving them for a few days, sticking them in a freezer, and then asking, hey, got any complaints about how things have been going lately? But as much as I loved just making that joke, that wasn’t exactly how it went. Because the group that was about to seize the initiative wasn’t the poor urban workers, though their time would come. It would instead be the educated, eloquent, and ambitious elites of the Third Estate, the bourgeoisie.

[(06:52)](#!):

So getting back to the story, after Brienne resigned at the end of August 1788, he was replaced by Jacques Necker, the Swiss Protestant banker who had been out in the political wilderness since being driven from the royal ministry back in 1781.

[(07:07)](#!):

In the meantime, he had dedicated himself to defending his time in office generally and his comforan due specifically. It was this running defense that torpedoed Brienne’s attempt to bring Necker into the government after the fall of Cologne. Ignoring the king’s specific order to keep quiet during the assembly of notables, Necker got himself banished from Paris in April 1787. But his public reputation continued to flourish, and Brienne actually tried a couple more times to bring Necker into the ministry, if for no other reason than to mollify the kingdom’s creditors, but the king would have none of it. It was only after the royal treasury literally ran out of money that the king was forced to give in and invite Necker back into government. As with the announcement to convene the Estates General, the announcement that Necker was returning to power was celebrated by some pretty wild street parties, leading to clashes between overly jubilant crowds in Paris and the local police. But also like the Estates General, Necker had now become something of a mythical figure, capable of righting all wrongs, undoing all injustices, and saving the kingdom from ruin.

[(08:16)](#!):

The situation now was so bad, and there was so much hope heaped onto his shoulders, that even had he been a once-in-a-generation genius, Necker would have had trouble living up to expectations. But Necker was not a once-in-a-generation genius. He was a pretty decent banker and a really good self-promoter, but he was not the magical wizard that the public thought him to be.

[(08:42)](#!):

The third bit of news to kick off celebrations in the street came in mid-September 1788, just a few weeks after Necker’s return to office. That was when it was announced that the Paris parloumant would be coming back from its vacation, with all its previous authority restored. The return of the magistrates was greeted by exuberant public demonstrations that sometimes got a bit too exuberant, leading to further clashes with the police.

[(09:08)](#!):

But as I said last week, the magistrates of the parloumant were increasingly uneasy about their alliance with these unruly mobs. And so when they reconvened on September 24th, they were all about restoring order, not resuming the fight. While saying that they would investigate police misconduct, they announced an immediate ban on the kinds of public demonstrations just recently held in their own honor. This was greeted with suspicious murmuring in the streets. Then the very next day they jumped into the middle of the debate that had swept the country in their absence, and they came down squarely on the totally wrong side.

[(09:48)](#!):

As you’ll recall, in announcing the convening of the Estates General, Brienne had invited everyone to weigh in on what form it should take. It had, after all, been 175 years, so what do you guys think we should do? Now, it was thoughtful of him to ask, but there was an ulterior motive. He hoped that the resulting debate would divide the nobility from the commoners, and boy was that starting to work like a charm. When Neckera arrived, he encouraged this debate by freeing journalists jailed for their previous works and lifting the ban on private clubs.

[(10:20)](#!):

By inviting public comment on the issue, the ministry had invited the Third Estate to look at itself and conclude that it was worthy not just of a seat at the table, but a dominant seat at the table. Because almost immediately a broad public consensus formed around the idea of doubling the representation of the Third Estate and then voting by head and not by order. With the Dauphine Estates Provincial now meeting under those very terms, the public was given a visible model to point to and say, like that, that is what we want the Estates General to look like, because if it is good enough for them, it is good enough for the whole kingdom. But of course, the nobility was concerned about losing control should such a democratic body be convened, and they started working behind the scenes to ensure that the king stayed true to traditional principles. So when the Paris Parliament reconvened, it would be the first public test of the aristocracy’s commitment to the public good, and they failed it badly, fatally. On September the 25th, the Parliament announced that it was their considered opinion that when the Estates met, it should be along the traditional lines of 1614. That is, equal representation, vote by order. This brought public support for the Parliament to a tire-screeching halt. And right there, that was the ballgame for the Parliament. Since the beginning of the crisis, they had been the center of the action and the leaders of the fight. But by coming down on the side of traditional composition of the Estates General, they utterly destroyed their political credibility. It was 1789, not 1614, and the old ways were just not going to cut it, and anyone who thought that the old ways were going to cut it, well, they were dinosaurs fast approaching extinction.

[(12:12)](#!):

Wanting to move quickly to halt the financial crisis, Neckerre announced in early October that he was speeding up Brienne’s timetable, and that the Estates General would now meet on January the 1st, 1789. To help wrap up the debate over the body’s composition, he decided to go back to the well that had worked so well for the ministry the last time around, and convene a second assembly of notables, who would be tasked with sifting through all the arguments floating around out there, and making a recommendation to the King about how the Estates General should be constituted. But though this second assembly would jam up the works just like its predecessor had, it was for the opposite reason. The first assembly had been more radical than expected, or at least less compliant than expected. The second assembly, though, was altogether more conservative than Neckerre had expected.

[(13:02)](#!):

After this new assembly convened on November the 6th, the first test vote came back a resounding 111 to 33 against doubling the representation of the Third Estate. The matter of voting by head never even made it to the floor. The nobility, it seemed, had come to realize that they probably had more to fear from an increasingly democratic France than an increasingly despotic France.

[(13:27)](#!):

As the latest news of the assembly’s secret deliberations inevitably leaked into the press, the whole tenor of the political debate changed. Just a few months before, the aristocracy and the commons, for lack of better designations, had fought together against the tyrannical abuses of a royal ministry run amok. But now the commons identified their primary enemy not as the King, who began to be cast in the role of fatherly protector, but rather the selfish nobles, who clung to their unjust privileges against all reason, justice, and mercy. An alliance between the King and a newly self-conscious Third Estate against the aristocracy was now potentially in the making.

[(14:10)](#!):

Now as we just noted, the vote against doubling the Third in the Second Assembly of Notables was decisive, but it was not unanimous. Because as we’ve seen, there was this thing called a liberal noble. These guys believed that the modernization of France required the nobility to renounce the old forms of prestige\xe2\x80\x94exemption from taxes, the right to collect seigneurial dues, the right to be insanely over-represented in the Estates-General\xe2\x80\x94and adopt new ones based on their superior education, experience, and merit. This was exactly the path laid out by Adrien Dupour. You remember him? He was the young noble in the Paris parlour who helped lead the resistance to Brienne’s reform package. Well in November 1788, as the Second Assembly of Notables was meeting, Dupour took advantage of the unbanning of private clubs and began to host regular meetings at his house of like-minded liberal nobles. This small and loose-knit group was soon dubbed the Society of Thirty and its membership roles read like a who’s who list of early revolutionary leaders. And I will note some of them here briefly for the record, but we’ll deal with each of them in turn as they move towards the center of the action. There was Lafayette, of course, the hero of two worlds, the prominent lawyer Targ\xc3\xa9 who had once upon a time been Cardinal de Rohan’s counsel during the Diamond Necklace affair, the eminent philosopher and mathematician the Marquis de Condorcet, the popular writer and orator the Comte de Mirabeau, who would turn out to be either a great hero of the people or a money-grubbing turncoat depending on who you talk to, and then two clergymen of note, the Abb\xc3\xa9 CS, who we’ll talk about more in a second, and then the Bishop of Houtan, Charlie Maurice de Talleyrand, to those of us in the English-speaking world, who will in time become the greatest foreign minister France has ever seen, and I may as well say it right now, one of my all-time favorite historical figures ever. We will deal more with Talleyrand much further down the road.

[(16:14)](#!):

The Society of Thirty, described by Condorcet as a conspiracy of decent men, would help organize and lead the newly awakened Third Estate into political prominence.

[(16:26)](#!):

The Society was engaged in two major activities at this point. First, sponsoring pamphlets arguing the case of the Third Estate, and second, drawing up and distributing model petitions for various guilds and municipalities and clubs to flood Necker with over the winter to force him to accept doubling the third and voting by head. By December 1788, over 800 such petitions had overflowed Necker’s inbox, and with the Second Assembly of Notables either recommending the king go in the other direction, or suggesting that maybe when the deputies of the three estates meet, their first order of business should be deciding for themselves what form their deliberations should take. Necker was forced to abandon his plan to convene the estates early, and go back to the original timetable of Spring 1789.

[(17:17)](#!):

Before the Second Assembly officially dispersed in mid-December, the Paris parlour led once again by Dupour and de Premenil made a bid to reclaim some of the court’s lost prestige by issuing a clarification of their previous recommendation that the estates meet on quote traditional lines. All this had meant, they argued with hilariously maintained straight faces, was that the electoral districts should remain the same. We for sure weren’t talking about how many delegates should be elected, or how they should vote once they convened. No one bought this transparent revisionism.

[(17:53)](#!):

As for the king, in his considered opinion, the opinions of the parlour no longer mattered. They had just put him through hell, and he didn’t give two figs what they thought about anything.

[(18:05)](#!):

But as the parlour was trying to regain public favor, the princes of the blood were about to tell the king to outright ignore it. Accepting the Duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans and the Comte de Provence, the other five princes issued a memo to the king recommending in the strongest possible language convening the estates on the 1614 model. Once the public got a hold of this memo, as they now got a hold of pretty much everything, there was a sharp backlash against the princes, leading to further polarization between the nobility and the emerging leadership of the Third Estate.

[(18:39)](#!):

Louis meanwhile was fed the heck up with his aristocracy. He was honestly trying to do the right thing, the best thing, and he was irritated by the prince’s unnecessary poking of his people, and the movement towards an alliance between the king and the Third Estate got a little stronger. Finally, or at least it should have been finally, on December the 27th, Necker released a document called The Result of the King’s Council of State. Now this should have been the formal declaration of how the estates would convene and by what rules, putting to bed this particular argument. But instead, it only invited further trouble.

[(19:19)](#!):

Though it unequivocally stated that the Third Estate’s representation would be doubled, it was silent on the question of voting and on the electoral process. So gee whiz, thanks for the clarification, I guess we’ll just go back to our acrimonious little war over the details now. With so many major questions left unanswered, the Society of 30 sponsored a pamphlet written by the abbey C.S. that was designed to become one of the great documents of the French Revolution.

[(19:48)](#!):

C.S. was technically a clergyman, but had long been engaged in Enlightenment pursuits. And as a commoner, he had dealt firsthand with the nobility’s unenlightened privileges. Intelligent and ambitious, C.S. had been frustrated by the nobility’s lock on all the top positions within the church hierarchy. Already skeptical of that hierarchy, this frustration led him naturally towards more radical philosophizing when the country became consumed with the question of how to convene the estates general. His contribution to the debate was a pamphlet entitled, What is the Third Estate?

[(20:25)](#!):

In it, he minces no words and pulls no punches. The Third Estate, he says, was not an order. It is, instead, the nation itself. The other two estates are just parasites, sucking the life out of France. What is the Third Estate, he asks? Everything. What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing. What does it desire to be? Something. When the estates convened, he recommended that the delegates from the Third ignore the other two orders and declare themselves to be the only legitimate national assembly.

[(21:02)](#!):

What is the Third Estate? was hugely influential. And it is impossible to ignore the fact that though it wasn’t necessarily planned, the early days of the estates general pretty much went according to C.S.’s prescription.

[(21:17)](#!):

Meanwhile out in the provinces, everyone got a sneak peek of what was to come when the various provincial estates, which had been given permission to convene, started trying to get together. Because right away, there were clashes between the nobility and the Third Estate over the number of deputies and how they would vote. This became especially critical because Nicair had not yet revealed how the process of selecting delegates to the estates general would work, and everyone sort of assumed that they would be elected from the estates provincial. So controlling them meant controlling the estates general.

[(21:52)](#!):

When the estates of Brittany, for example, attempted to convene in January, the inter-estate fighting got so bitter that a royal order came down to postpone the meeting for a month. The ticked-off nobles went ahead and met anyway, and then the Parliament of Rennes declared that all the spontaneous municipal assemblies that were cropping up were in fact illegal. Which raised tensions and caused the city’s law students, who had just recently been the street muscle of the pro-parliament demonstrations, to defect to the cause of the Third Estate.

[(22:25)](#!):

On January the 26th, the Breton nobles then organized a counter-demonstration to support the traditional order, filling a lot of the seats with the further call to lower the price of bread. I wonder which excited the demonstrators more. This counter-demonstration was then counter-counter-demonstrated against. Party clashes ensued, and the nobles wound up barricaded inside their meeting hall. They would eventually have to fight their way out. Literally, swords in hand. With all of this proceeding in such an orderly manner, Necker decided maybe he should be a little more clear about how the estates would be elected.

[(23:01)](#!):

Though he once again sidestepped the question of vote by order or vote by head, on January 24th, 1789, he did break down the electoral procedure for everyone. And immediately, the provincial estates stopped being a battleground, because they would not, I repeat not, be electing delegates to the Estates General. Instead, voting would go by these old divisions called the Biage, one of those random internal political lines that overlapped with everything else.

[(23:32)](#!):

In addition to these regional voting districts, eight of the bigger cities like Paris and Lyon would be allowed to elect their own delegates. So in all, there were 234 constituencies of about equal size. Each would convene a separate assembly for each order. The nobles would elect two delegates, the church would elect two delegates, and then the third estate would elect four delegates. Anyone would be allowed to represent anyone else, as long as the electoral assembly selected them.

[(24:02)](#!):

Now obviously, the nobility and the church would only allow their own to represent them, but this did lead to fears that the nobles would exploit the people’s natural deference to get themselves elected as the third estate’s representatives. But this only happened in a handful of cases, and most of those guys were in fact in favor of the third estate. The January 24 decree also laid down the suffrage requirements, which would wind up having a huge impact on who actually showed up for the estate’s general. Participation in the first estate electoral assemblies was open to all priests, and then one representative per monastic order.

[(24:42)](#!):

This rather broad base meant that the vast majority of those participating in the electoral assemblies for the church were ordinary parish priests, rather than high-ranking noble bishops. And as we’ll see, the men sent as delegates and the grievances they carried with them very much reflected this reality.

[(25:02)](#!):

The second estate, meanwhile, was open to only those with a hereditary title, which excluded all recently ennobled men whose hereditary rights hadn’t kicked in yet. That meant that the second estate’s elections were controlled by decidedly more conservative elements. Even the super noble courtiers were viewed suspiciously when they returned to their quote unquote homes that they had in many cases never actually been to, and found election not nearly as automatic as they thought it would be.

[(25:33)](#!):

Finally, there was the third estate, too numerous to handle anything but indirect representation. Male taxpayers 25 years or older were allowed to come to a primary assembly that would elect delegates to go on to a further assembly that would elect the actual delegates to the Estates General. What this meant was that to move on to that further assembly, you had to have the time and the means to afford it, and then of course the skill and eloquence to convince the primary voters to send you.

[(26:03)](#!):

Which meant that the one group within the third estate who really fit the bill were the lawyers. There would be a lot of lawyers representing the third estate. The other major task of these assemblies was to draw up a list of grievances called cayi. Basically, what do you think is wrong? What do you think we should do about it?

[(26:25)](#!):

These cayi have become justifiably famous in the academic world because when else does history leave for you a comprehensive accounting of a society’s collective complaints and their collective dreams right on the eve of a major revolution. It is an insanely rich and detailed primary source for just what the French people were thinking about right before the French Revolution broke out.

[(26:51)](#!):

With every municipality and village allowed to draw up their own list, in the end something like 25,000 of these things were floating around from every corner in the kingdom. Plus Nicair made a conscious decision not to try to influence the process of drawing them up. So they are all pretty unfiltered. Now of course as with the previous round of petitions, so-called model cayi were distributed to make it easier for the inexperienced locals to pick and choose from pre-selected grievances. But they almost always had particular complaints tacked on about how, you know, hey that bridge has been out for a while and you keep not doing anything about it.

[(27:31)](#!):

With each delegation, from each order, from each constituency, tasked with bringing in a cayi with them to the Estates General, the final list naturally reflected the composition of the various electoral assemblies. So the bishops of the first estate had to watch in horror as the church’s delegations marched off with lists that included higher stipends for local priests, tithe money going to where tithe money was supposed to go to, and the opening of administrative posts to everyone noble or not.

[(28:03)](#!):

But as anti-noble as these grievances were, even the parish priests wanted to make sure that no one messed with the supremacy of the Catholic Church and its centrality to French community life. And it will be over that issue that the revolutionaries will eventually turn their allies among the lesser clergy into their enemies.

[(28:24)](#!):

The cayi of the second estate, meanwhile, was defined by nothing so much as their lack of unity. What the courtiers wanted was not what the poor provincials wanted, and neither of them wanted what the young liberals wanted. The only thing that appears to have been universally agreed upon was that their tax exemption was now indefensible. For the good of France, they were willing to renounce that privilege. But other than that, the nobility was at completely cross-purposes with itself.

[(28:54)](#!):

The cayi of the third estate, meanwhile, were the most numerous, and by far the most far-reaching. But as with the nobility, there was a great divide within the third estate about its aspirations. On the one hand, there were the vast hordes of peasants who asked for things like stable bread prices, less tyrannical tax collection, no more abuses from local lords. And on the other were the modernizing reformers of the urban bourgeoisie who wanted free markets, individual liberty, both fiscal and civic equality.

[(29:26)](#!):

But the funny thing was that though all the rural municipalities took the time to draw up grievance lists and take them to the primary assemblies, when their representatives took them on to the next level, most of the suggestions from the rural peasants were edited out. After all, those secondary assemblies were all filled with merchants and doctors and lawyers. So the official cayi brought by the delegates of the third estate reflected the platform of the bourgeoisie, not the rural peasants.

[(29:57)](#!):

With the elections for the state’s general progressing into March and April 1789, the kingdom continued to be plagued by food shortages and general unrest. In many places, the sheer fact of listing the grievances was believed to impart some de facto legality to the proposed reforms, and the people started refusing to recognize feudal obligations, pay much-despised taxes, or put up with long-suffered abuses. This unrest was spread around pretty equally between the towns and the countryside, but they exploded most violently in Paris itself with the R\xc3\xa9veillon Riot.

[(30:32)](#!):

In an ill-considered remark, a self-made businessman named R\xc3\xa9veillon, who owned a major wallpaper factory, said that price controls on bread needed to be ended. This, he said, would lower the cost of bread, permitting workers to be paid less, which would lead to lower costs of goods leading back around to prosperity for everyone. But all the workers heard was that R\xc3\xa9veillon was going to cut their wages, at a moment when every livre was going to pay for bread that was just barely sustaining them.

[(31:04)](#!):

The misinterpreted remarks sparked a riot, the sacking of R\xc3\xa9veillon’s house, and major street clashes that left at least 25 dead, and I’ve seen estimates that run that number into the hundreds. The battle cry of the rioting workers was the King, the Third, and Necker. So this was the atmosphere in Paris, just as the delegates from the provinces began to arrive at Versailles to begin their epoch-making meeting of the Estates-General. Next week, we will get to dive right into the opening of the Estates-General, and this is where things will start to get moving in a big hurry.

[(31:44)](#!):

First up on the docket, that little question of voting by order or voting by head, which had still not yet been resolved, and would lead directly to a major constitutional crisis right off the bat.

[(01:54)](#!):

So here we are, ten episodes into this thing, and we’re finally getting to the start of the French Revolution. With the convening of the Estates General, and then the immediate grinding to a halt of the Estates General, events would begin to slip out of everyone’s control. But though things took a revolutionary turn from day one, or more specifically day two, there were a couple of things that we need to keep in mind. First, even with all the underlying problems with the Ancien Regime, the archaic political structure, the archaic economic structure, the archaic judicial structure, it will take a ton of mistakes, miscalculations, and misunderstandings to push this thing in the direction of revolution. With just a little bit better leadership, the Estates General of 1789 could have been an important point of historical transition for France as it moved towards modernity, but it did not have to spark a full-blown revolution. Second, as much as that revolution is compressed in the popular imagination, with the fall of the Bastille leading to the execution of the royal family leading to a general reign of terror, it actually takes years for all of this to unfold, and the various big moments are generally lodged in between months and even years of moderately smooth sailing. So I like to picture all of this more as a series of tornadoes rather than one big hurricane.

[(03:17)](#!):

So with that in mind, let’s do this thing.

[(03:21)](#!):

We left off last time with the election of delegates to the Estates General and the awakening of the Third Estate as a political force. I want to start this week with a short breakdown of the delegates who would actually show up at Versailles in May 1789, because though they did not know it, they were about to conjure up one of those tornadoes. The raw numbers look like this. Not counting subs and replacements, there were 295 delegates from the First Estate, 278 delegates from the Second Estate, and 604 from the Third Estate. So all told, we’re talking about 1200 guys. And though, as we’re about to see, these 1200 delegates had wildly different expectations about what was going to happen, one common connection they all shared was that they were all mostly from urban areas. Adding up the delegates from all three orders, about two-thirds of them lived in towns of more than 2000 people, half of those lived in cities of more than 20,000 people, and 211 came from Paris alone. If you take out the Paris priests, who are classified as rural by default, nearly three-quarters of the delegates were urban dwellers, even as urban dwellers made up just 18% of the total population.

[(04:36)](#!):

Another common connection was that most of these delegates were fairly well-off. As I mentioned last time, they were paying their own way, so you had to be of some means to afford the trip, though as the months dragged on, we will get more and more delegates stressing about how they’re going to be able to keep affording this. So with the doubling of the Third’s representation, the Estates General of 1789 was a more representative body than France had ever known. But we have to remember that the vast majority of France is poor and rural, and the delegates, for the most part, are well-off and urban. This will definitely help explain some of the decisions made by the future revolutionaries, and why the unexpected backlashes were so unexpected.

[(05:18)](#!):

So digging into each Estate, as we discussed at the end of last week, the defining feature of the first estate delegates was the overwhelming presence of the parish priests, as opposed to the high-ranking ecclesiastics. But though they formed a numerical minority, those high-ranking ecclesiastics were a far more organized clique. They all knew each other, had worked together, and were used to wielding the power, wealth, and influences that their offices granted them. They were an imposing force to deal with for the generally strangers to each other common priests who arrived at Versailles.

[(05:55)](#!):

The second estate, meanwhile, was dominated by the old nobility. If your nobility stretched back no further than the 17th century, you were all but cut out. After some perfunctory resistance, every one of the major courtiers was elected, and they were joined mostly by other well-off city dwellers. Half of the noble delegates lived in Paris full-time. Only about a quarter were true provincials, living in manor houses out in the countryside. So again, we’re talking well-off and urban, rather than poor and rural.

[(06:25)](#!):

The one group that really took a bath in the elections, though, were the robe nobility. The guys who were more recently ennobled, and who filled the ranks of the parlomah. Just a few months earlier, these guys had been the guys, and now only 22 managed to get elected to the Estates General. After winning the battle with Brienne over the reform package, the power and prestige of the parlomah went off a cliff, never to be seen again.

[(06:53)](#!):

Finally, the Third Estate delegations were dominated by no one group so much as the lawyers, though merchants, doctors, and professional landlords were present. And though these guys are often portrayed as political neophytes, most famously by de Tocqueville, who staked one of the causes of the French Revolution to men who had only engaged politics on a theoretical level, not having the tools to engage politics on a practical level, at least a third of the delegates had been involved in some capacity in the political battles of the last few years. So they weren’t completely wide-eyed, but it’s true that a lot of them were.

[(07:30)](#!):

The delegates began to trickle in at the end of April 1789, usually traveling in provincial groups, forming their first bonds with their new colleagues. Finally, with about 800 delegates having arrived, the King convened the Estates for their first day of official work. After a dedication procession the night before, the Estates General began with a carefully orchestrated ceremony on May the 5th in the largest hall at the Palace of Versailles.

[(07:56)](#!):

The nobles were instructed to wear their silk finery, the clergy to wear their full vestments, and the Third Estate was to dress in sober black, which rubbed many of the Third’s delegates the wrong way. It was as if they were being cast as merely a backdrop for the real delegates from the First and Second Estates.

[(08:14)](#!):

But no matter, the momentous occasion could not be ruined by a dress code. But what it could be ruined by was some terribly boring and incomprehensible speeches. Remember, this was the moment the Kingdom had been waiting for for years. Decades. For nearly two centuries. Surely the oratory would match this historic moment. But the Keeper of Seals opened with a speech that was literally inaudible to most of the delegates. Okay, bad start. But then along comes the great hero of the people, Jacques Neckerre. Surely he will seize the day.

[(08:49)](#!):

But instead of grand rhetoric, he treated them to a barely comprehensible and supremely technocratic analysis of the royal budget. After his voice gave out a half an hour in, the remainder of his speech was then read by some guy with a shrill and grating voice. The delegates had come to renew the Kingdom, and what they got instead confused and confounded and irritated them. And there was still no final word on how the voting would go \xe2\x80\x93 vote by head or vote by order. Neckerre’s speech hinted that maybe a combination of the two would work, but also said that the nobility and the clergy must freely give up their right to vote by estate. It would not be ordered by the king.

[(09:30)](#!):

So the delegates, especially those from the third estate, left the opening ceremony pretty unsatisfied and not a little bewildered about what was going on.

[(09:40)](#!):

The day after the opening ceremony, the real work began. And the first order of business would be verifying the credentials of all the delegates. This first order of business turned out to also be the last order of business for the quote, estates general. It was supposed to be a simple thing. The three estates would meet separately to verify their own membership roles. But left to their own devices, without explicit instructions or professional guidance, the members of the third estate were left to assume that they were free to plot their own course. And so right away the more prepared delegates started making speeches that separate verification of credentials was unacceptable. Verification must be of everyone, by everyone. Allowing separate verification would simply set the precedent that this was a meeting of three orders rather than 1200 individuals. Among those more prepared delegates were the men from Dauphine, led by Meunier. These guys had been successfully organizing the movement to vote by head for over a year now and they weren’t about to give it away on day two of the estates general.

[(10:46)](#!):

But Meunier and his associates were all about conciliation with the other orders, rather than confrontation. The Dauphine estates had been working well together. And indeed, when their delegation arrived, all three orders agreed to meet after hours to discuss today’s proceedings and plot strategy.

[(11:04)](#!):

But also present in the third estate was another provincial group fairly unified of purpose. And that was the Breton delegates. That is, the delegates from Brittany. As you’ll recall from last week, there were some pretty heavy clashes between the nobility and the commoners in Brittany over the winter. There were angry speeches, fierce denunciations, fighting in the street. The Breton nobility was in fact so incensed at not being able to convene their estates provincial on traditional lines, and then not having that traditional body elect the delegates to the estates general, that they boycotted the whole show. No noble delegate from Brittany ever came to Versailles.

[(11:43)](#!):

The delegates from Brittany’s third estate, meanwhile, were now pretty raucously anti-noble and had definitely come to town spoiling for a fight. They too met routinely after hours and soon invited other like-minded delegates to join them. These meetings earned them all the moniker the Breton Club, and after the National Assembly moved down to Paris and took up residence in a convent run by some Dominicans who had been nicknamed the Jacobins, they become the Jacobin Club. So this is where that comes from.

[(12:16)](#!):

But though their ultimate aims were different, both the men from Dauphine and the men from Brittany agreed that voting by order was unacceptable, and so they got up and started urging their fellow delegates to reject separate verification. With the Reddit convincing and the crowds cheering, did I mention there were crowds? There were crowds. Unlike the other two orders, the third estate opened its door to anyone who could fit in, and their daily meetings were well attended. As I said before, the audience will play a big role in all of this, like for example, when their cheering helps convince the newly arrived delegates to go ahead and pick a fight before even calling the roll.

[(12:55)](#!):

Swept up in the moment, the third estate decided it would transact no official business whatsoever as a separate order. They would wait until they were joined by their fellows from the other two estates before they did anything. So on day two of the Estates General, the third estate basically went on strike.

[(13:14)](#!):

Now the nobility of the second estate, of course, wanted no part of this, and they voted 186 to 46 to proceed as a separate order and got started with their own verification. Conservative elements, including our old friend Depremenil, were not about to let the liberals and the rabble seize the reins of power, and they even went so far as to long delay the admission of the nobles from Dauphine because of their reputation for playing nice with the third estate.

[(13:42)](#!):

The first estate, meanwhile, was divided. The parish priests were sympathetic to the third estate and certainly saw themselves more aligned with them than these fancy bishops, but the fancy bishops, as I said, were an impressive bunch to try to wrangle with, and after a lengthy debate, the first estate narrowly voted 133 to 114 to maintain themselves as a separate order.

[(14:06)](#!):

At the urging of Meunier and over the objection of the Breton delegates, the third estate then sent an unofficial delegation to the clergy on May 7th to try to arrange a little interstate summit to try to work something out. It was unofficial, of course, because the third estate couldn’t do anything to acknowledge that it considered itself a separate order. The clergy then went to the nobles and got them to agree to a sit-down.

[(14:32)](#!):

It took a week for them to all get together, but when they did, it became clear that the talks were not going to go anywhere. The third estate would accept nothing less than vote by head, and the second estate, now firmly controlled by the conservatives, would accept nothing less than vote by order. With the talks so deadlocked, the nobility withdrew on May 26th. The estates had now been in session for almost three weeks, and literally nothing had been accomplished. The king had, of course, been watching all of this unfold, or not unfold, and by May 29th, he was so fed up that he ordered the estates to get past this quibbling and do something. There is a reason you were called. We are still bankrupt. We do need a plan, remember?

[(15:16)](#!):

But if they were expecting to bring the third estate to heel by rejecting their overtures, the nobility badly misplayed their hand. Aside from the Breton delegates, most of the men representing the third estate were perfectly willing to work with the nobility. They just wanted to do it as one big group. Had the nobility granted that right away, they likely could have swooped in and guided the debate in the direction they wanted it to go. But by isolating the third estate and leaving them all alone in a room together, the nobles all but guaranteed that the third would become more radical because if you don’t want to work with us, then we’re not going to do anything to try and work with you.

[(15:55)](#!):

Then of course, just as the nobility was refusing to convene as a single body, the third estate was given a further radical injection when the Paris delegates finally showed up. Their elections had taken a while to work out, so it wasn’t until the end of May that the Parisians arrived and through all of this, the Parisians are not going to be trying to put the brakes on anything.

[(16:17)](#!):

On June the 3rd, the more confrontational arguments from the Breton Club began to carry the day, and the third estate started moving towards unilateral action. They would begin transacting business, but not as the third estate. Rather, they would declare themselves to be some kind of meeting of the commons or some kind of national assembly \xe2\x80\x93 we’ll work the name out later \xe2\x80\x93 and then proceed as if they were the only legitimate body in town.

[(16:43)](#!):

On June the 10th, the ABCS, recently arrived from Paris, moved that the other two orders be given a final invitation to join them. This passed 493 to 41. After waiting two days, no response. The third estate delegates proceeded to call the roll not as the third estate, but as this other self-proclaimed comprehensive assembly. Compared to everything else, it seems like a little thing, but this decision to go it alone \xe2\x80\x93 on their own authority \xe2\x80\x93 was a revolutionary break with all political precedent. ABCS noted that this was the moment that the cable was cut.

[(17:22)](#!):

The day after the roll call began, the first little part of the wall separating the estates began to crumble when three parish priests crossed over the lines. They were greeted by wild, sustained applause. Over the next few days, 16 more clergymen came over to this thing that was now in session and guys, we really do need to figure out what to call ourselves. So when the roll call ended, that is the matter they took up.

[(17:47)](#!):

Following his own arguments from what is the third estate, CS reminded everyone that they already were the nation and should act accordingly. And so on June the 15th, he proposed that they be called the Assembly of the Known and Verified Representatives of the French Nation, which was a bit unwieldy, but then it sparked a debate that would lead the delegates trying to outdo each other in preposterously long names. Meunier’s suggestion was, and I kid you not, the legitimate assembly of the representatives of the larger part of the nation acting in absence of the smaller part. Which yeah, that rolls right off the tongue.

[(18:26)](#!):

After two days of increasingly absurd suggestions, CS came back to the floor on June 17th and proposed the name he had wanted all along, but didn’t think anyone would go for it. The National Assembly. Maybe it would have been too much at first, but now it was a nice, concise breath of fresh air. By a vote of 491 to 89, the body formerly known as the third estate was now called the National Assembly. Right after they declared themselves to be the National Assembly, the Breton delegates then seized the moment and pressed for an even more radical pronouncement.

[(19:04)](#!):

They moved for a declaration that all existing taxes would henceforth be considered illegal until approved by the National Assembly. For the moment they could still be collected, but only because the National Assembly was granting them a provisional sanction until they could be reviewed one by one. If for any reason the National Assembly was forced to stop meeting, that provisional sanction would be revoked, and all Frenchmen everywhere could consider themselves free to stop paying.

[(19:34)](#!):

Just a few weeks before, this would have been unthinkable. But after being ignored by the nobility and then locked in a room with each other for over a month, the delegates of the new National Assembly were now prepared to unilaterally claim all political sovereignty. This insanely provocative declaration passed unanimously. So boy, that happened fast. The king, meanwhile, was not processing any of this. Back on June the 4th, that is a little over a week before the third estate rechristened itself the National Assembly, the king’s oldest son and the heir to the throne suddenly died at the age of seven.

[(20:12)](#!):

The poor kid had dealt with pretty severe health issues his whole life and just finally succumbed, right now, at this moment. And even though parents of the past seemed to be a little more detached from the death of children because it happened with such unnerving frequency, the death of the prince devastated both Louis and Marie Antoinette, and so at this critical moment the centerpiece of the entire political order, the King of France, did not have his head anywhere close to the game.

[(20:43)](#!):

On June the 19th, the plot then thickened even further when the first estate took another vote and narrowly decided to join the National Assembly. The conservative bishops then rushed to the king and begged him to do something. Nicaer suggested Louis call everyone together for a royal session. This session would allow the king to reassert some kind of overarching control and also give him a chance to introduce a reform package drawn up by Nicaer to mollify the third estate delegates or whatever they were calling themselves before all of this got out of hand. Louis agreed. But like I said, his head wasn’t really in the game. And I think that helps explain some of why everything is about to be botched so badly.

[(21:26)](#!):

Now what happens next is a matter of some debate. Some say it was obviously the first step in a planned royal coup. Others say it was just a misunderstanding. Republicans are arguing about it to this day.

[(21:40)](#!):

Whichever it was, though, what we do know is that none of the delegates were ever told about the planned royal session. Nor that workers would need to take over the meeting hall of the third estate slash National Assembly to make preparations. So when the delegates started to arrive for work on the morning of Saturday June the 20th, what they found was armed guards standing in front of a locked door. Rather this was really just a bad case of miscommunication or something more sinister. The men of the National Assembly really couldn’t possibly see it as anything but sinister. On the day that they were expected to formally welcome all the delegates from the first estate, the door is locked and guards are telling us we can’t come in. Yeah I’m sure your intentions are perfectly benign.

[(22:29)](#!):

Refusing to be broken up, the delegates then cast about for the nearest unlocked room large enough to hold them all. And someone suggested an indoor tennis court three blocks down the road. So that’s where they went. And there took part in the first great dramatic set piece of the revolution.

[(22:46)](#!):

Written by the lawyer Tarjet and proposed by Meunier, the delegates were presented with the following affirmation. The National Assembly, considering that it has been summoned to establish the constitution of the kingdom to effect the regeneration of public order and to maintain the true principles of monarchy, that nothing can prevent it from continuing its deliberations in whatever place it may be forced to establish itself. And finally, that wheresoever its members are assembled, there is the National Assembly. It decrees that all members of this assembly shall immediately take a solemn oath not to separate and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the kingdom is established and consolidated upon firm foundations. And that, the said oath taken, all members and each one individually shall ratify this steadfast resolution by signature. And then they all took a mass oath never to be separated.

[(23:44)](#!):

I’ve thrown up the very famous drawing by Jacques-Louis David of this momentous event at RevolutionsPodcast.com so you can get a sense not just of what happened, but how it was immediately deployed to begin building the myth of the revolution. After taking Sunday off, the National Assembly then reconvened on Monday, June the 22nd, at which point they were finally joined by most of the clergymen who were greeted by wild applause, hearty pats on the back, and many passionate speeches.

[(24:15)](#!):

That same day, the next little bit of the wall separating the aesthetic crumbled when three nobles from Dauphine requested admission to the body. For the first time, representatives from all three orders were present in the National Assembly. With preparations for the royal session finally complete, the king now had an opportunity to calm the waters, reassert a little order, and guide everyone away from dramatic revolutionary setpieces. Though he had in hand a 35-point reform plan that the delegates of the Third Estate were going to love, things got off on the wrong foot even before the session started.

[(24:56)](#!):

First of all, you’ve got to wonder where this plan was at the opening ceremony. I mean seriously, could the Royal Ministry be screwing this up anymore? This is what everyone had wanted on May the 5th, and now it was six weeks too late. Then the delegates of the Third Estate, or National Assembly, were forced to mill around in an adjoining room, while the clergy and the nobility were let in first and allowed to take their seats. This was a slap in the face that none of them could miss.

[(25:24)](#!):

Then when they got in and looked around, Jacques Necker was nowhere to be found. Apparently, Necker had been notified the night before that the king had been persuaded to go in a harder-line direction, and he decided to just stay away. So instead of leading off with the reforms, the king instead started with a blunt nullification of the declarations of June 17. That is, the Third Estate is not the National Assembly, and you can bet your ass all my taxes are legal. With this confrontational posture thus set, it was hard for the delegates to pay attention to the reforms ticked off. Even if it was all stuff they liked, the Estates General would approve all taxes, everyone would get a regular meeting of their estate’s provincial, there would be no more arbitrary imprisonment, a few of the more unpopular taxes would just be immediately abolished, this was all good stuff. But then the king wrapped things up by saying that the Estates are still a thing, and though he now personally urged them to join together, any matters directly affecting the nobility or the clergy would be vetoable by those orders. Oh, and one more thing, absolutely nothing is valid without my approval. Then he ordered everyone to disperse and left the room.

[(26:38)](#!):

But as the nobility and clergy started to file out, the Third Estate delegates did not. They were ordered to by the king’s men again, whereupon they said, if you want to move us, you’re going to have to bring in the men with the guns. Then they all renewed the tennis court oath and reaffirmed their declarations of June 17 and dared the king to order their dispersal by force.

[(27:01)](#!):

But when someone rushed to tell the king that the Third’s delegates weren’t going anywhere, he just shrugged his shoulders and said, oh well, let them stay. And this was the problem with Louis. He could never decide what he was really trying to do. He had just held a royal session to reassert his authority, and when that authority was directly challenged, he said, yeah, okay, whatever. The French Revolution did not happen because Louis XVI was an evil tyrant, but it was helped along the way by him being a pretty spineless feather in the wind.

[(27:33)](#!):

The next little crisis Louis faced after the session was that upon his return, he was greeted by Neckerre’s resignation. It had become clear to Neckerre that arch-conservative elements inside the royal family were intentionally sabotaging all attempts to bring the estates together. Though he was ultimately persuaded to stay on, news that he had not been at the royal session led to rumors that he had already been dismissed. In Paris, tens of thousands of people gathered around the Palais Royale to vent their frustrations. Then, the same thing started happening in Versailles itself, and then a whole mob marched on the palace, pushed their way past the gate and into the courtyard. Neckerre had to come out to say that, no, no, no, I have not been dismissed.

[(28:19)](#!):

But back in Paris, the crowds continued to loiter ominously, and then, when two guard units were ordered in to break them up, the guard units refused to move. These were common soldiers, and they had much more sympathy for the crowds than for their own officers. Coincidentally, these were the same two units that had followed orders to go break up the Revillon riots just a few months earlier. So times are changing fast.

[(28:48)](#!):

During the failed royal session, all that remained of the walls between the estates broke down for good. On June the 24th, all the clergy still holding out came over. And then on June the 27th, 47 nobles, led by the duc de Orleans, showed up at the door and were welcomed by thunderous applause. Two days later, the king gave it up and ordered everyone to convene as a single body. Anyone who was still holding out because they had instructions from back home to only meet as separate orders was hereby relieved of those instructions. The National Assembly was now truly the National Assembly.

[(29:28)](#!):

Next time, we will get into one of the biggest dramatic set pieces of the whole revolution \xe2\x80\x93 the fall of the Bastille. Probably one of the most defining revolutionary moments in the whole history of the world \xe2\x80\x93 even if it was pretty well blown out of proportion. But we’ll talk about that.

[(29:46)](#!):

Now I say next time, though, because the Family Revolutions is about to take off on a vacation back to the northwest, so I’m taking the next week off. But keep an eye on the feed, because though I won’t be posting an episode, I will be posting something next Sunday night, and I’m pretty sure it will be about the next round of tours, which will be launching in spring 2015. So keep an eye out for that, because it’s all first come first serve. And then I will be back in two weeks to talk about the destruction of the great symbol of tyranny, and the freeing of its hordes of political prisoners, and by that I mean a handful of forgers and a couple of lunatics.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions, Episode 3.11, The Fall of the Bastille.

[(02:14)](#!):

Okay, so we are back from vacation and ready to plunge into the thick chaos that was France in July 1789. Hopefully everyone downloaded the tour announcement while I was gone, and if you didn’t, please go check it out. There is a brand new American Revolutions tour and another run through England and Paris, which will include stops at the very places where most of today’s episode is going to take place. So go to revolutionspodcast.com for all the details, and then sign up, because the slots are going fast.

[(02:47)](#!):

So we left off last time with the final disintegration of the Estates General and the King’s Order for all three Estates to come together under this self-declared thing, the National Assembly. As will often be the case over the next few years, many observers at the time thought that this moment would mark the end of the Revolution. The demands of the Third Estate for double representation and voting by head had now been achieved. It had taken more of a fight than the Third Estate delegates had really wanted, but having emerged victorious, it was time for everyone to settle down, come together, and work up a plan to save the Kingdom from its many, many problems.

[(03:27)](#!):

Little did they know that this supposed finish line was about to be reduced to a mere footnote in history, because just two weeks later, the Paris mobs went nuts and stormed the Bastille, and that sort of became the IT event of the summer, at least until two weeks later when the National Assembly got drunk on enlightened patriotism and tore down the entire feudal apparatus of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime in a single night. But that will wait for next week.

[(03:55)](#!):

Now though the actual storming of the Bastille could not be predicted, that something bad might be ready to erupt in Paris was something any keen observer could divine. For one thing, the bad harvests of 1787 that had led into the bad harvests of 1788 meant that the food stocks were dangerously depleted in all major metropolitan areas. The middle of July was especially bad, because what had been stockpiled from the previous harvest was basically gone, and this year’s crop had yet to be brought in. These few midsummer weeks were a tough time to be a French stomach.

[(04:33)](#!):

So in July 1789, bread prices were as high as they had been since the flower war, and everyone was just a wee bit on edge. On top of that, the first of July marked the biannual, that is twice yearly, deadline for settling of debts, including any overdue rent. So just as everyone’s already meager income was going to purchase a meager amount of bread, all the bills started coming due, and no one had any money to pay them off. So to say that the people of Paris were restless would be a massive understatement.

[(05:08)](#!):

Into this dangerous mixture of hungry anger, the royal ministry decided to throw a spiky ball of fun into the middle of it. Slowly at first, but then increasing by the day, troops started to be reassigned from the frontiers into the city, and no one didn’t notice. At first, the troop buildup actually went on behind the back of the king. Louis had been distracted by the death of his son and trapped by his own indecisiveness in the lead up to the royal session, and so the minister of war had colluded with reactionary members of the royal family to increase the garrisons of Paris and Versailles in case force would be needed to push through the king’s will. As I touched on at the very end of the last episode, when the people’s hero Jacques Necker didn’t show up for that royal session, the people of Paris and Versailles started gathering in huge numbers and going rabble, rabble, rabble, and the troop buildup seemed to be justified. Even more so when the local guard unit sent in to disperse the crowds straight up refused the order.

[(06:09)](#!):

With the local units clearly unreliable, four more regiments were ordered in from the frontier. In just about a week, the residents of Paris saw the soldiers in their midst go from about 4,000 to about 20,000. Like I said, no one was missing what was going on, and everyone expected the hammer to drop at any moment.

[(06:30)](#!):

In the aftermath of the little mutiny of the guard units, ten soldiers were arrested for disobeying orders and publicly denouncing their own commanding officer. But this only provoked the Parisians to further direct action, and on June the 30th, some 4,000 people marched on the prison the arrested guardsmen were being held in, pushed their way in, and absconded with the prisoners.

[(06:52)](#!):

These freed guardsmen were kept out of the reach of royal authority, but the emerging independent political leaders of Paris who we will talk about more of in a second were concerned about provoking the crown too much, and so arranged a face-saving compromise where the mutinous guardsmen were returned to their cells for a night and then released without charges in the morning.

[(07:13)](#!):

But even with that crisis defused, troops continued to arrive in Paris, and as if that wasn’t bad enough, those troops were very often foreign-born mercenaries, mostly Germans and Swiss. Paris folded in neatly with the prevailing conspiracy theory that Queen Marie Antoinette was now actively working with her brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, to like seize control of France and destroy the burgeoning democratic movement. And for the moment, this conspiracy theory went way too far, because as we’ll see down the road, the other European heads of state were positively delighting in the news coming out of France that the Bourbon dynasty was getting kicked around by its own people. Weak Bourbons means weak France, and weak France means strong ami. I can promise you, there is not a lot of sympathy or sentimentality at that level of international politics. But the Queen was involved in a smaller conspiracy that would wind up sparking all that was about to explode in Paris. Specifically, she and the king’s brother, the Comte d’Artois, were working day and night to get Jacques Necker kicked out of the Royal Ministry. They didn’t like him because he was foreign, they didn’t like him because he was a Protestant, and they really didn’t like him because he was a commoner.

[(08:29)](#!):

They wanted the king to take a tough line on all this rebellious nonsense that was consuming the monarchy, and replacing the people’s hero with someone more sensible only seemed prudent. So in the lead up to the Estates General, and then over the first months of its life, they worked to undermine Necker’s influence at every step. It was probably as a result of their pressure that his speech at the opening ceremony focused almost entirely on technical matters of the budget, and was definitely the result of their pressure that the royal session turned from conciliatory gesture to hard-line stare-down.

[(09:04)](#!):

But the Queen and the Prince were forced into a tactical retreat when confronted by the rage over the mere hint that Necker might have been dismissed, and they had to support the king when Louis persuaded Necker to stay on. But that was only a tactical retreat. Once they had enough troops in place, it would be time for the Swiss wonderboy to go, and time for the monarchy to reassert its authority at gunpoint if need be.

[(09:31)](#!):

The first week of July, though, was not quite the time, and the matter that started to absorb the kingdom was the escalating bread crisis. Things were bad in Paris, but the whole country was facing food shortages. There were bread riots in Flanders and Normandy, and confrontations in all the areas surrounding Paris where it seemed like any available grain was being confiscated to feed the Parisians.

[(09:54)](#!):

The worst of it all happened in the now dangerously underemployed manufacturing city of Lyon. There, bread prices led to mob attacks on the tollgates, whose sole purpose it now seemed was to make already expensive bread even more expensive. With reports like this coming in from all over, the newly harmonized National Assembly debated what to do about the bread shortages from July the 4th to July the 7th, but they could come up with no viable solution. Discounting the arch-conservative defenders of the old order, the majority of the delegates were the kind of enlightened reformers who were all about free trade and free markets. But this was not exactly the moment to be publicly defending free market principles, with the mobs demanding cheap bread, and we don’t care how you do it.

[(10:40)](#!):

So the delegates studiously talked their way around the issue without committing to anything in particular. And this is one of the main reasons Necker enjoyed such mass popularity. He was just about the only guy with any kind of power actively pursuing subsidized bread and enforced price controls. He had long positioned himself as an opponent of the old Physiocrat platform, and he continued to push for controlled markets now more than ever, and the people loved him for it.

[(11:10)](#!):

So it was a really bad time for the Queen and the Carme Tartuat to decide that the second week of July was the right time to make their final move against Necker. Obviously under the impression, they now had the strength to handle whatever fallout would come. They convinced Louis to sack Necker on the afternoon of Saturday, July the 11th. The king did not need much personal convincing, as he detested Necker going back to the showdown over the Compte-Rondu in 1781. So just as Necker was sitting down to dinner, he received a note from the king that not only fired him from the ministry, but also ordered him to leave the country at once and further to tell no one he had been fired and exiled.

[(11:50)](#!):

The idea here was that Sunday was a day off, so by the time everyone got up on Monday morning and heard the news, Necker would be long gone, and the troops in Paris and Versailles would be ready to nip in the bud any attempt to agitate in the ousted minister’s favor. Necker amazingly kept up his end of the bargain. He didn’t even tell his dinner guests what the note said, and he quietly slipped out of Versailles on a roundabout route back to Switzerland.

[(12:16)](#!):

The mobs in Paris most assuredly did not keep up their end of the bargain. Day off or no, as soon as they found out Necker was gone, they went bonkers. News reached Paris of Necker’s dismissal the next day, on Sunday, July the 12th, and it set off a shockwave. Coupled with the sudden influx of troops, it was all but taken for granted that Necker’s dismissal was the precursor to violent reprisals against the people and the probable shuddering of the National Assembly. Given the atmosphere, it was impossible for the common people not to believe that unless they did something, they were all like about to be massacred.

[(12:55)](#!):

So in those heady moments of fear and anger and uncertainty, a 26-year-old aspiring journalist leaped onto a table at a caf\xc3\xa9 inside the Garden of the Palais Royale and started giving the speech of his life. This young man was Camille de Moulin, and he was about to launch a revolutionary career that would eventually see him become one of the prominent children the revolution wound up devouring. De Moulin was the son of a provincial lawyer and administrator who arranged a scholarship for his son to attend the prestigious Coll\xc3\xa8ge Louis-Lagrand in Paris, which is known today as the Lyc\xc3\xa9e and is still probably one of the most prestigious secondary schools in France. There he was not only steeped in classical literature and the law, but he was also a classmate of the man we’ll get to when it comes time to transition from the National Assembly to the Legislative Assembly, Maximilien Robespierre.

[(13:53)](#!):

De Moulin was supposed to become a lawyer, but he didn’t have quite the makeup for it. He was tempered, and ironically enough, not eloquent enough of an orator. But he had a sharp and passionate mind and turned to political journalism to make a living, just in time for the Ascien regime to enter into its fatal death spiral, which was quite a time for a 26-year-old with a sharp and passionate mind to go into political journalism. On the evening of July the 12th, he gathered with friends at the Palais Royale to protest the dismissal of Nicaer, and almost spontaneously became the center attraction of the unorganized milling about that was going on.

[(14:34)](#!):

With news and rumors swirling, he stepped up on a table and started haranguing the crowd. The gist of what he said was, this is it, they’re coming for us, and it’s only a matter of time. We can either submit or arm ourselves to see this thing through. At a well-timed moment, perhaps dramatically or perhaps honestly, Demoulas looked off in the distance and spied the troops marching in to arrest them all. He waved a pistol in one hand and pointed at his heart with the other and said, I would rather die than submit to servitude, or in the American version, give me liberty or give me death.

[(15:10)](#!):

The crowd was convinced, mostly leaderless but filled with desperate energy. They marched out of the Palais Royale to fight whatever was about to be thrown against them. The first thing they did was parade through all the theaters where the people were enjoying their day off, closing them up and forcing everyone out into the street to join the agitation. From there, people started gathering in strength in the garden of the Tuileries Palace, basically the front yard of the Louvre if you’ve ever been to Paris, and if you haven’t, well there is a tour in the spring and we’ll be standing right in the middle of it.

[(15:44)](#!):

With this angry crowd mobilizing, a regiment of mercenary German cavalry rode in to try to restore order, but they were completely outnumbered. Then when units of the French Guards showed up, ostensibly to reinforce them, well the French Guardsmen, all being pulled from the ranks of the urban workers, just switched sides and started fighting against the German cavalry, forcing them to retreat from the Tuileries, leaving into the hands of no one in particular, the headless mob.

[(16:12)](#!):

But there was a little head that would attempt to control this outburst of public anger. Not very well, ultimately, but not too bad given the circumstances. These were the electors of Paris who had taken over the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, basically Paris City Hall. The Paris electors were the guys who had elected the delegates to the Estates General, but after those elections were over, they had voted to keep convening as a sort of shadow government, one that would be far more responsive to public opinion than the existing administrators. With the people up in arms, the electors became the one body who might be able to lead them.

[(16:50)](#!):

Now they couldn’t move fast enough to control anything on that first explosive night. And pretty soon, just as had happened in Lyon, the tollgates and customs walls surrounding the city were smashed randomly, but with a great deal of relish. As it all spilled into the next morning of July the 13th, every swordsmith and gun shop in town was raided for weapons, and then a huge group turned its attention to the Abi Saint-Lazare. Now, I’ve got conflicting information on what they were actually looking for, whether it was a weapons cache or grain stores, but whichever it was, what they found was a pretty big quantity of surplus grain, which only fueled the paranoid rumors that the evil aristocrats had been purposefully starving them out this whole time.

[(17:34)](#!):

The abbey was ransacked. In the middle of all this, the troops that had been called in over the last few weeks were just overwhelmed, and their officers pulled out of the city center completely. Basically, Paris was now in revolt. And winning. But the Paris electors were not wild anarchists, and they didn’t like the idea of mob rule any more than the archist arch-conservative. So they started organizing a citizen’s militia to help tone down the excesses and bring a little order to this rebellion.

[(18:06)](#!):

Without obviously the time or the means to give anyone uniforms, it was suggested that everyone wear an identifying cockade\xe2\x80\x94that is, a round ribbon that could be pinned on a hat or shirt or whatever\xe2\x80\x94to help identify each other out in the streets.

[(18:20)](#!):

Originally, this cockade was supposed to be green, green being the color of hope, and green flags even started going up as the official color of the rebellion. But then someone pointed out that green was also the color of the comp d’artrois, who was now rising to major villain status, and so they instead went with the red and blue, the colors of Paris. This would later be added for political reasons, the white of the Bourbons, to produce the official revolutionary tricolor of blue, white, and red. So that is where that comes from. But even with the policing now becoming self-policing, it was nearly impossible to keep order.

[(19:00)](#!):

On the fateful morning of Tuesday, July the 14th, mobs stormed Les Invalides, a complex of buildings that served as a veterans’ hospital, and today houses the Mus\xc3\xa9e de l’Arm\xc3\xa9e, the museum of the army, which, hey look, the revolution’s tour is going there too. Come on, you know you want to come. Easily brushing past the veteran guards, the mob located an arsenal of nearly 30,000 muskets, which were then just handed out indiscriminately.

[(19:30)](#!):

The mob also got their hands on a couple of heavy guns, but what they didn’t have was powder, because the officer in charge of Les Invalides, knowing it was only a matter of time before his cash was ransacked, managed to transfer 250 barrels of gunpowder to the only place in the city that might be able to keep it out of the hands of this crazed rabble, the great fortress at the east end of Paris, the Bastille. So before we go on, we should probably stop for a minute and talk about what the Bastille actually was.

[(20:02)](#!):

The Bastille was a medieval fortress. Construction began in the mid-1300s when France was deep in the middle of the Hundred Years War with England, and the east side of Paris needed defending. It was rectangular in shape, with four towers on each of the long sides. These towers were five to seven stories tall, and did indeed provide a formidable obstacle for anyone trying to come at Paris from the east.

[(20:28)](#!):

But though the Bastille was designed for defense against foreign enemies, and then wound up being used as a pretty critical strong point in a number of different internal upheavals over the centuries, it was most famously, and most reliably, used as a prison, holding enemies of the state from at least the early 1400s on. During the reign of Louis XIII, or more specifically, the reign of Cardinal Richelieu, the Bastille really started to earn its permanent reputation as a symbol of tyrannical and arbitrary imprisonment.

[(21:01)](#!):

Employing those Lettres des Cach\xc3\xa9s we’ve talked about, the king and his ministers could arrest anyone, for any reason, at any time. Most high-profile dissidents found themselves locked up in the Bastille at some point or another, as did any writer who ran afoul of the censorship laws or wrote something seditious. But as much as this all smacked of despotism, one of the easiest ways to wind up in the Bastille was to simply be a juvenile delinquent in a prominent noble family.

[(21:31)](#!):

Once you had ticked off mommy and daddy one too many times, they could go to the king and purchase a Lettres des Cach\xc3\xa9s to have their little black sheep thrown in prison to be rid of the headache for at least a little while. Once in the Bastille, the prisoners were held in octagonal cells in the middle stories of those eight towers.

[(21:51)](#!):

Conditions depended obviously on who you were, with poor sods living off meager but adequate meals in bad but not nightmarish conditions. The wayward nobles and men of Lettres, though, could generally live pretty comfortably. They were allowed to bring in their own furniture and books and receive visitors pretty much whenever, because if you had the money, it’s not like the guards weren’t going to be friendly. But though the conditions weren’t that bad, stays weren’t that long, and often came at the request of your own family, the popular myth of the Bastille as a symbol of torturous despotism only grew during the 1700s, as various embellished memoirs were published by former inmates that described hundreds of skeletal figures chained to the walls of pitch-black dungeons with only diseased rats for company. This, even as the Bastille housed fewer and fewer prisoners, and its daily upkeep became harder and harder to justify in the face of crippling state deficits.

[(22:50)](#!):

So on the eve of the Revolution, the Bastille sat on the east side of Paris, a massive living symbol of all that was arbitrarily unjust about the Ancien regime, even if it was not really that thing in fact.

[(23:04)](#!):

But, as I am now contractually obligated to tell you, none of that had anything to do with why nearly a thousand Parisians started gathering outside the fortress on the morning of Tuesday, July 14, 1789. It had nothing to do, at least for the moment, with tearing down this symbol. It was all about getting the powder necessary to fire the muskets and guns seized from Les Anvalides. Inside the Bastille, Governor Bernard Ren\xc3\xa9 Delaunay watched the crowd grow with mounting unease. He had accepted the powder, but had been given only 32 additional Swiss guards to help him protect it.

[(23:44)](#!):

Related to his permanent complement of 82 veterans who were too old or disabled to serve in the field, Delaunay was not exactly commanding an impressive defensive force. On top of that, the Bastille currently held enough food to last them all just two days and had no internal water supply, so withstanding a siege was basically out of the question.

[(24:08)](#!):

Soon enough, two representatives sent by the Paris electors pushed their way through the crowd and asked to be let in to parlay with Governor Delaunay. They were let in to talk. But by accident or design, their conference went on far too long, and the crowd started to suspect that their two representatives had just disappeared into the evil maw of the great prison. So a third representative from the Paris electors went in, with specific instructions to demand the powder and the two dozen or so heavy guns stationed around the Bastille and then come back out. Delaunay said that handing over the powder and guns was impossible, without orders from Versailles, but did point out that he was in the process of removing the guns from the walls, and then he sent the representatives on their way.

[(24:56)](#!):

When nothing further had happened by noon, the representatives headed back to the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville to confer with their elector colleagues. But while they were gone, all hell broke loose. A small group of adventurous souls scaled the guardhouse, got inside the outer courtyard, and cut down the rope holding up the drawbridge. Once it dropped, the crowd rushed inside. Which is, of course, when the panicked soldiers guarding the inner fortress fired their guns either by accident or by orders, who knows, and something like a hundred Parisians were killed or wounded. This of course only enraged the mob further. Most had no idea that their own people had cut the drawbridge, and thought they had deliberately lured into a bloody trap.

[(25:41)](#!):

Over the next few hours, the mostly civilian mob was bolstered by soldiers from the now openly rebellious guard units and defecting soldiers from the regular army. These soldiers gave the siege some much needed professional direction. They dragged down the heavy gun seized from Les Invalides and pointed them at the door to the inner fortress. Knowing that those doors would never hold, Governor Delaunay waved the white flag. Or more specifically, he stuck a white handkerchief through the door to signal that he was ready to talk.

[(26:13)](#!):

At around 5 o’clock that evening, he then stuck a note through the door, saying he would give up, as long as he and his men were allowed to go free. If not, he was fully prepared to ignite all the gunpowder and just blow the whole fortress and everyone in it to smithereens. This surrender, though, was refused by the angry crowd, who weren’t about to let the butchers inside the Bastille walk out without facing a little mob justice. So the guns were pointed back at the door, and this time they dropped open.

[(26:46)](#!):

The crowd rushed into the inner fortress, disarmed the soldiers, and seized the gunpowder. Then they excitedly looked around for the great hordes of political prisoners, no doubt still chained pitifully to dungeon walls, dying to be set free. But all they found were seven old men, four who had been convicted of forgery, two who were lunatics in the parlance of the times, so suffering from some mental health problems in the parlance of our times, and one was a deviant aristocrat, held at the request of his own family. None of these guys were particularly thrilled to be caught up in the middle of all this. Even the most infamous prisoner of the Bastille, the super-deviant Marquis de Sade, had been transferred out the week before, after repeatedly shouting revolutionary slogans at people passing the streets below his window and generally making a nuisance of himself.

[(27:37)](#!):

But that didn’t stop the mobs from parading these seven old men through the streets like they had just freed a gaggle of Nelson Mandela’s.

[(27:45)](#!):

The mob then turned its attention to the now-captive soldiers, and most especially Governor Delaunay. Demanding some kind of justice for their fallen comrades, the mob seized on Delaunay as a wicked mastermind who had purposefully lured them to their deaths. They marched him back towards the Hotel de Ville, and though he survived the journey, he was pretty badly beaten, kicked, and spit on along the way. For those of you who have asked about what’s going on in the Revolution’s podcast logo and in the artwork at the masthead at RevolutionsPodcast.com, that is poor Governor Delaunay being led out of the Bastille.

[(28:23)](#!):

When the mob reached the Hotel de Ville, people started shouting suggestions about how exactly to dispose of this bloodthirsty little villain they had captured from the Fortress of Tyranny. After some creative suggestions were thrown out there, one guy tried to bring a little sanity to the proceedings and said, look, we should take him inside the Hotel de Ville and decide his fate after tempers have died down a little. Whereupon Delaunay, and I’m not making this up, shouted, enough, let me die, and kicked this guy, and it’s crude I know, but I’m just gonna say it because it’s true, he kicked him right in the balls.

[(28:59)](#!):

In about two nanoseconds, Delaunay was stabbed from a dozen different directions. When his lifeless body hit the ground, a barrage of pistol shots hit the corpse just to make sure. Then his head was sawed off with a pocket knife and paraded through the streets in triumph. Shortly thereafter, three other Bastille officers and two regular soldiers were also lynched by the crowd. The Bastille had fallen. What would happen next?

[(29:31)](#!):

Nobody knew. It was not until the next day that news of all this reached the shocked members of the National Assembly and the even more shocked king up in Versailles. In one of the most hilariously out-of-touch diary entries in history, all Louis had noted for July the 14th, 1789 was quote, nothing today.

[(29:50)](#!):

But as bad as that looks, I will tell you in the king’s defense that this was a hunting diary and he had simply caught nothing that day while out on a hunt. Then of course, there was the likely apocryphal but still widely recounted conversation on the morning of July the 15th. When the Duke de la Rochefoucou told the king that the Bastille had been stormed, Louis asked, is it a rebellion? And the duke replied, no sire, it is a revolution. But was it a revolution quite yet?

[(30:23)](#!):

If it wasn’t, if this could all be written off as the kind of aimless mob uprising that sprinkled the history of all major cities, then what happened next certainly lodged it firmly in the collective historical memory as the moment that the French Revolution really began. Because as we will see next week, back up in Versailles, the king will all but concede that he was now merely a partner in government rather than an absolute monarch.

[(30:48)](#!):

Out in the provinces, an irrational panic will sweep the countryside and lead to the complete destabilization of all existing social, economic, and political bonds. And in the National Assembly, the delegates will try to get out in front of this panic turmoil by tearing down whatever was left of the Asian regime over the course of one single delirious night.

[(01:53)](#!):

So we left off last time with Paris rising up in armed revolt and then storming the Bastille. But as I hinted at the end of last week’s episode, it was the response to this unexpected turn of events that puts the fall of the Bastille at the center of every revolutionary chronology.

[(02:11)](#!):

The attack on this ill-defended and archaic fortress prison could have passed as a random outburst or it could have marked the beginning of a violent conservative reaction. But instead, it was the immediate precursor to the demise of absolute royal authority in France. Because as Louis’ ministers came to advise him about what to do next, they were forced to conclude that there was very little he could do next. And being able to do nothing is what sealed the fate of the absolute monarchy.

[(02:44)](#!):

Now the reason Louis could do nothing gets to a prescient question asked by listener Svante in the comments to last week’s show that is setting me up beautifully for how I want to start this week’s show. He asked if the royal family had pulled 20,000 soldiers into Paris in anticipation of riots, why weren’t those soldiers used against the rioters? Surely it would have been possible to at least relieve the Bastille, even if they didn’t have time to stop the first riots, why didn’t that happen? The answer, in short, is that no one in a position of authority now trusted those 20,000 soldiers to do what they were ordered to do.

[(03:24)](#!):

The problem, though, was not just that the common soldiers might disobey or defect, which yeah, they might very well. It was that all levels of the regular army, the senior officers, the junior officers, the rank and file, were deeply dissatisfied with their present condition and all for their own reasons. To put it plainly, in 1789 the French army was deeply dysfunctional.

[(03:50)](#!):

Now I skipped past all the military issues when we walked through the pre-revolutionary period because it would have muddled already muddled waters, but I want to run through it now real quick because it does help explain why Louis was basically powerless to stop the uprising in Paris and why he could never hope to use his own army to overcome the revolution. So a good place to wind back to is May 1781. Jacques Neckerre has just been kicked out of the ministry for the first time, and a new set of counselors is taking over. Almost immediately, they push through the so-called Siguer Ordinance, named after the minister of war, Marshal Siguer.

[(04:31)](#!):

The Siguer Ordinance was a reactionary reform measure aimed at restricting the rise of all those new-robed nobles into the upper echelons of the army. For the last hundred years or so, the newly wealthy and newly ennobled men of the kingdom had been buying and pushing their way up the social hierarchy, and they clearly had designs on moving up the military chain of command as well, a chain of command that was supposed to be the exclusive preserve of the old sword nobility.

[(05:02)](#!):

So the Siguer Ordinance set requirements on how far back your hereditary rights had to go before you qualified for those upper ranks. The Ordinance was very much appreciated by the poor old provincial nobles, who really had only the army to look to anymore as a place to direct their sons for social advancement.

[(05:21)](#!):

It was detested, on the other hand, by the new nobles who could now only top out at captain, and it was really super detested by career soldiers who were good at their jobs, deserved promotion, and saw their career prospects decapitated right before their very eyes. It didn’t help that these professionals usually had to slave away under the command of some twenty-year-old brat son of a courtier who was mostly in it for the hats and the girls. Starting with resentment, the actual talent within the army was now trapped. But as the fiscal crisis grew, change would hopefully soon be coming to the army.

[(06:00)](#!):

Change then came in a huge way in 1787 when Archbishop Brienne, desperately looking to economize the state, looked at the army as a prime target for savings. To go dig up these savings, Brienne put in charge of the project a reforming colonel, the Comte de Guibert, who was given this two-fold task, make the army better and make the army cheaper. Guibert took up this nearly impossible assignment with zeal. He started eliminating or vastly reducing redundant regiments, especially those used only for show. Then he took a look at the insanely top-heavy officer corps and just started hacking it down to a reasonable size. At that moment, the French army had twelve hundred generals, more than all other European armies combined. The cost of maintaining these fancy but utterly redundant positions was simply unjustifiable.

[(06:56)](#!):

So as generals retired, the plan would be to just not hire new ones until everything was in much better balance. Then he went after the civilian contractors who supplied the army at a cost far in excess of what the army would pay if it just took on the job of supplying itself. But of course everything I’ve just rattled off, showpiece regiments, high-ranking generals, civilian contractors, well these are filled with prominent and well-connected men, and they didn’t like any of it one bit.

[(07:26)](#!):

But while he was busy alienating the pants off the old sword nobles, Guibert did little to satisfy the new nobles and the professional soldiers who wanted a shot at promotion. Guibert was a disciple of Frederick the Great, and he truly believed in the concept of a permanent military aristocracy that you couldn’t just buy your way into. So far from eliminating the severe ordinance, he actually made it even stricter.

[(07:50)](#!):

His plan was to expand and further subsidize the twelve provincial military academies to identify good young nobles and train them properly for a life in arms. He had no use whatsoever for prancing dandies, but he clung to the belief that properly trained the old sword nobles were in fact the only suitable men to lead a great army. As for the common soldiers, Guibert was initially their hero. He took a look at their pay and determined that it was utterly inadequate. So as he cut across the board on everything else, he actually increased the pay for privates.

[(08:27)](#!):

But as he gave with one hand, he beat them senseless with the other. As I said, Guibert was a disciple of Frederick the Great, and Frederick the Great was all about discipline. So incredibly strict rules of conduct were introduced, with incredibly strict penalties for violations. The soldiers were not prepared to be suddenly judged by such inflexible Prussian standards, and morale plummeted.

[(08:52)](#!):

So adding it all up, Guibert’s reforms looked great on paper\xe2\x80\x94he was cutting costs, he was increasing efficiency and discipline, he was creating a whole new generation of well-trained noble warriors to lead the French army back to its rightful place as the greatest military force in Europe. But on the ground, it was a very different story. The soldiers sulked under the painful new disciplinary regime, the junior officers continued to resent their inability to rise higher in the ranks, and the senior officers were deeply offended at having their pensions cut, their expenses unreimbursed, and then their jobs simply eliminated. And of course, as they looked at the royal ministry with now undisguised contempt for shoving this all down their throats, they looked at each other with undisguised contempt, and everyone blamed everyone else for their misfortunes.

[(09:42)](#!):

So this was the army that was being called on in July 1789 to restore order in Paris, and after a few first confrontations, it was pretty apparent that it would be madness to rely on them to bring the hammer down without just making everything ten times worse. So after being told that it was just too dangerous to put the troops in the field, Louis was now left with only one option\xe2\x80\x94go down and inform the National Assembly that he was going to order the army out of Paris.

[(10:12)](#!):

But though this in and of itself was a fairly momentous admission that wherever authority now lay, it did not lay exclusively with the king, the way Louis chose to make this announcement dramatically underscored the point.

[(10:26)](#!):

Because when on the afternoon of July 15, he went in person to the National Assembly, he went down there by himself, well practically by himself, he was flanked only by his two brothers, the Comte d’Artois and the Comte de Provence. But other than that, no one. No grand retinue, no fancy clothes, no pomp, no circumstances, no ceremonies, none of the pageantry that had been so essential to the myth of royal absolutism.

[(10:55)](#!):

The delegates of the National Assembly were downright shocked when the king was announced, and then when he just walked in. Some of the delegates tried to give him a cold reception, but when Louis told them he was pulling the troops out, there was unrestrained cheering for our father the king. And though this speech, on the day after the fall of the Bastille, has become the moment many historians point to as the end of royal absolutism in France, the thing to remember is that no one in the room at that moment wanted this to be the end of the monarchy. That would have been unthinkable.

[(11:31)](#!):

So after the king’s visit, a group of about a hundred delegates saddled up their carriages and made straightaway for Paris to give the city the good news. This group was led by two of the most prominent members of the National Assembly, the Marquis de Lafayette and Jean-Sylvain Bailly. Now Lafayette we know, but Bailly we do not, though most Frenchmen at the time surely did.

[(11:55)](#!):

Bailly was probably the most renowned scientist and astronomer in the kingdom. When the Estates General was called, he was one of the few delegates with national name recognition of any kind, and when the Third Estate finally started to start transacting business, one of their first votes was to make Bailly president of the assembly. Which meant that he was the providing officer at the tennis court oath, and if you pull up that famous David drawing, Bailly is the guy front and center with his right hand raised.

[(12:25)](#!):

When this delegation from the National Assembly reached the Hotel de Ville in Paris, they were greeted, obviously, by mass jubilation in the streets. But amidst the happy and idealistic cheering, something ominous was lurking in the crowd that day, namely the widespread assumption among the people of Paris that they had just single-handedly saved the National Assembly from destruction, and that their role as defenders of the revolution was now set in stone. As we will see, the conflation of Paris with the revolution, and that to be against one was to be against the other, would not ultimately lead to particularly happy and idealistic results.

[(13:07)](#!):

But for the moment, it was all pretty good. Lafayette, the man who had made his name as an officer in the American Revolution and who was the surrogate son of the great George Washington, was asked by the Paris electors to take command of that hastily raised citizen militia we talked about last week, a citizen militia that would soon be more formally organized into the National Guard.

[(13:29)](#!):

Then the electors selected Bailly to be mayor of Paris, a brand new office that would lead a brand new political entity called the Paris Commune, an elected assembly representing the 48 sections of the city, which would, in time, become the engine of the revolution, and help do things like cut off the head of the man they first elected mayor, Jean-Sylvan Bailly. The next day, the king himself came down to the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville to confirm all of this in person. To great public acclaim, he confirmed Bailly as mayor, confirmed Lafayette as head of the National Guard, and announced again that the troops were being pulled out of the city.

[(14:08)](#!):

Then he gave everyone the last bit of news they had been waiting for. Couriers had been dispatched to track down Jacques Necker, wherever he was on the road back to Switzerland, and bring him back to run the ministry. This was everything everyone wanted to hear. Then the king donned one of the blue and red cockades, signaling that everything that had gone on since the convening of the Estates General was now ratified.

[(14:32)](#!):

Louis was no longer some brilliantly shimmering symbol of absolutism that hovered somewhere in between God and France. He was a citizen king. He had come down from Versailles a quasi-deity and returned just a man, though, much to the relief of his wife and children, he did in fact return. Back in Versailles, this was all too much for some conservatives to take. All their scheming having come to naught, the queen and the Comte d’Artois had to figure out their next move. The queen was advised to leave the palace, but she refused to take flight, and besides, where would she go, and what would she do when she got there?

[(15:11)](#!):

No, for better or for worse, the royal family was going to have to stick it out. The Comte d’Artois, meanwhile, was all done, and with a small retinue of loyal friends and associates, quickly and quietly decamped Versailles and headed for the northeastern frontier, leading what would become the first batch of aristocratic emigres fleeing from the revolution, who would collectively become known as the capital-E emigres. Some of these emigres would collect around the Comte d’Artois’ little court in exile, wherever it happened to be stationed, others settled in England, and still others made it all the way to America to await the day when hopefully the madness would stop.

[(15:52)](#!):

Though the king basically capitulated to the uprising in Paris and given them everything they wanted, it’s not like the situation immediately improved. Bread was still scarce and way too expensive, and the mob was not quite done dispensing justice. When the intendant of Paris, that is, the guy who had been running the show, tried to join the first wave of emigres and hightail it out of town on July 22, he and his son-in-law were discovered. They were summarily lynched, and their decapitated heads paraded around Paris. If the fall of the Bastille had surprised everyone in the National Assembly, the lynching of the Paris intendant was downright chilling.

[(16:33)](#!):

The Bastille had been a reaction to a perceived mortal threat, and though distasteful was very possibly justified given the circumstances. But the lynching of the intendant? That had come after the king had backed down, after Bailly had been elected mayor, after Lafayette had been given control of the National Guard, and under whose protection the intendant supposedly was. There was no justification for such lawless cruelty. As had been the case with the Magistrates of the Parliament, if you were a delegate of the National Assembly, you had to wonder just how safe it really was to be protected by the Paris mobs, especially if your interests ever diverged.

[(17:14)](#!):

But for the moment, there was no immediate hint of a break between Paris and the national government, and the unfolding crisis of the summer of 1789 turned out from the center to the periphery. Conditions were bad everywhere, and had been for quite some time. The process of drawing up those grievance lists prior to the Estates General had focused everyone’s displeasure, given its specific names and specific faces. And then the newly focused Provincials had all been forced to sit and wait for something, anything to come of it.

[(17:48)](#!):

They sent their delegates off to Versailles at the end of April, and then they waited through May as literally nothing happened, with the Third Estate fighting its little war for common verification of credentials. Then all of June passed without anything of substance being done. The declaration of the National Assembly and the Tennis Court oath were neat, but to some broke silkworker in Lyon, or some suffering peasant in Provence, it was just so much semantic posturing.

[(18:16)](#!):

So when the Provincials II hit the hungry midsummer weeks of July 1789 with no relief in sight, well, the uprising in Paris and the fall of the Bastille was taken as a signal that all bonds were cut and it was time to start taking matters into our own hands.

[(18:32)](#!):

In almost every municipality, self-declared committees followed the lead of the Paris electors and started unilaterally taking control of local government. Mostly these groups were the provincial electors, but others were just like-minded men getting together and saying, okay, we’re now in charge. These guys were for the most part middle-class lawyers, coming from the same demographic as the majority of the delegates in the National Assembly. Citizen militias were then organized with the help of defecting soldiers from the regular army, the old men of local prominence, the nobles or ranking clergymen, and either got on board or were simply pushed aside.

[(19:11)](#!):

While this revolution was going on in the municipalities, the cities and the bigger towns, something much less focused was brewing out in the countryside. Remember, France was still overwhelmingly rural, and this little municipal takeover by the bourgeoisie still left the vast majority of the population without much of a political voice. They were now about to start making enough noise to shake the kingdom to its foundations. So when we last left the peasants, they had gotten together and drawn up their little grievance lists and cast their little votes for who would go off to the next round of elections to select the real delegates to the Third Estate.

[(19:51)](#!):

Then they returned to their farms, and as soon as they did, most of their specific little grievances were edited out by the Third Estate delegates who could not really be said to be representing the peasantry at all. The peasants, though, still expected their burdens would be lifted, and as they too heard only of deadlock and Versailles, they started to get restless.

[(20:13)](#!):

As I touched on last time, there were bread riots across the kingdom through the spring and early summer, and confrontations with local authorities everywhere as many peasants acted as if the simple act of writing down their complaints had broken any obligation to pay this toll or work on that project for free. Then when Paris went into revolt, everything kinda went a little crazy, and a sudden panic swept across the countryside that has since been dubbed the Great Fear.

[(20:44)](#!):

It’s tough to pinpoint exactly where and how the Great Fear started, but the basic ingredients were this. You have hungry people with no food, unemployed people with no work taking to the road to look for work, already organized migrant beggars getting a little too pushy about their begging, the widespread belief that the aristocracy had been purposefully hoarding grain to drive up prices, and the further widespread belief that the upper echelons of the royal family were in cahoots with foreign powers, be they the British or the Austrians, to crush the people beneath the boot heel of a reassendant and tyrannical nobility.

[(21:23)](#!):

So after the fall of the Bastille, rumors started swirling that reactionary members of the aristocracy, working on their own or with the help of foreign agents, were hiring groups of brigands to fan out across the countryside to terrorize the people of France back into their previous state of oppressed submission. With so many poor migrants now clogging up the roads from everywhere to everywhere else, it became easy to believe that there was something deeply menacing going on. Local peasants started gathering together to form protective patrols, who would arm themselves with whatever was laying around, and then go out themselves to look for these villainous brigands who were supposed to be just over the next hill.

[(22:04)](#!):

But of course, when these protective patrols were spotted by the next town over, they were often mistaken for these alleged brigands. Panic swept across rural France in a matter of days. But once they were all suitably riled up and paranoid, it didn’t take long for the defensive posture of the peasantry to go into attack mode.

[(22:26)](#!):

Wherever the great fear spread, people started refusing to pay basically anything they had once been expected to pay. No more taxes, no more feudal dues, no more church tithes. All of it was simply a part of the same oppressive apparatus that was lining the pockets of the evil aristocrats who were now sending brigands and thieves to loot and pillage our countryside. Plus it was taken for granted that the National Assembly was about to abolish it all anyway. So no, we’re all done with all of that.

[(22:57)](#!):

Then they actively turned their attention to the physical manifestations of aristocratic tyranny. Those noble mills that they had been forced to use, smashed. The noble wine presses they had been forced to use, broken. But as these angry peasant mobs began to descend on the manor houses that had for so long dominated their little corners of the world, there was one thing above all that needed to be destroyed. The feudal records. I’m talking about the physical pieces of paper that noted exactly who owned what, who owed what, and for how long they owned or owed it.

[(23:35)](#!):

The angry peasants simply pushed their way in past terrified noble families, located the records, and burned them in great bonfires. Soon enough, huge plumes of smoke were rising up across the countryside, visible for miles around, spreading the general fear and panic even further. At this moment, in the last weeks of July 1789, political authority in rural France simply collapsed. And the records that all that political authority was based on was currently going up in smoke.

[(24:10)](#!):

Meanwhile, back in the towns, and then up in Paris and over in Versailles, the little cliques of revolutionary bourgeoisie who had taken over were utterly appalled. Remember, these guys were lawyers, or men who did enough business to respect utterly the sanctity of contracts, and more than that, the fundamental concept of private property. Marching around burning property records was insane, and it scared them.

[(24:37)](#!):

The delegates of the National Assembly had to sit through weeks not just of official reports about the state of the provinces, but also frantic letters from their families about what was happening in their own hometowns. They issued a totally inadequate appeal to the peasantry to please stop burning records and please keep paying taxes and tithes until we, your appointed representatives, can work out a new system. But this appeal was just ignored. So come August the 3rd, the men still meeting after hours as the Breton Club hatched a plan both to get out in front of the chaos and then secure the further list of demands they had now come up with for the king.

[(25:16)](#!):

They decided to launch this plan as the next day’s session wound to a close, when attendance would hopefully be sparse and one of the Breton delegates would be serving his turn as presiding officer. Which brings us to the night of August the 4th. The Breton Club’s plan was pretty straightforward. At the appointed moment, a liberal noble, one of those members of the Society of 30 whose name I won’t trouble you with, would step forward with a motion to allow the peasantry to escape their feudal obligations and to force all men to pay taxes in proportion to their income, without notice of social status.

[(25:56)](#!):

This would basically begin the process of demolishing feudalism in France, and hopefully get the rampaging peasants off the warpath. With the chamber sparse and no one prepared to oppose such a bold gesture, the Breton delegates would then rally, push it through, and then dare anyone to try to undo it. But as bold as the Breton Club thought it was about to be, they had no idea what was about to be unleashed.

[(26:23)](#!):

First of all, the chamber wasn’t quite as sparse as they had hoped. Okay, well, no matter, but then the appointed liberal noble got his lines stepped on by a rival noble whose name I also won’t trouble you with. This guy had caught wind of the plan, and wanted to steal a little glory for himself, and so he unexpectedly jumped up and moved for the abolition of feudalism himself. All our appointed liberal noble could do was then stand up and say, yeah, I basically agree with that, let’s do it.

[(26:52)](#!):

This quick one-two punch caught many of the delegates off guard. Then they heard three prearranged speeches by Breton delegates agreeing with those motions. This all made it look like some spontaneous domino effect had been triggered, and far from wanting to fight against it, all the delegates suddenly wanted to join the fun. So other men, now truly spontaneously, started coming forward with their own calls to abolish specific parts of the feudal apparatus.

[(27:23)](#!):

Now at first, this was all driven by an infectious sense of patriotic self-sacrifice, with nobles themselves stepping forward to renounce their own rights, like when a bishop moved that the church’s feudal claims should be abolished along with those of their noble cousins. In these first motions, serfdom, that is, families being legally bound to the land, was abolished in the few places it still existed, then all forms of forced labor went with it.

[(27:49)](#!):

Then noble hunting rights went away, all internal tollways, any kind of private court. Then the third estate representatives from the cities and corporations came forward and renounced their own privileges, their own exemptions, and their own rights. Venal office was abolished, and public employment was opened to all on the basis of merit alone.

[(28:11)](#!):

But along the way, the self-sacrifice gave way to fun little offers for others to make self-sacrifices. The motion to abolish noble hunting rights, for example, had been put forward by a bishop. So a few speeches later, a noble who happened to really like his hunting rights stood up and moved for the abolition of tithes, which, like everything else, was approved with passionate acclamations. So now the clergy had no income, which is not what anyone was expecting going into this. As midnight passed, this just went on and on, and everyone who was there describes the experience as surreal, with everyone trying to outdo everyone else.

[(28:51)](#!):

Sometime after 2 AM, the crazy session finally wound down, and a 16-point declaration was drawn up to try to summarize what had just happened, because by then, no one could quite remember who had said what or what they had all agreed to. Of everything that had gone on, only three big motions didn’t make the final list. Full religious freedom for Protestants, the end of slavery in the colonies, and the call to just abolish nobility outright. The rest was approved to weeping and hugging. Then they all went to bed convinced they had just participated in one of the greatest events in French history.

[(29:32)](#!):

What had begun as a general attempt to declare that in principle feudalism should probably be abolished, had turned into a delirious and hyper-specific deconstruction of the entire structure of privilege that had bound the kingdom together for centuries. And remember, until this moment, those privileges had been synonymous with political liberty. Relating privileges had been the crux of the war between the parlement and the royal ministry.

[(30:02)](#!):

But now, those privileges had been razed to the ground. So if Frenchmen still wanted to enjoy this thing called liberty, they were going to have to invent a whole new definition from scratch.

[(30:15)](#!):

And next week, that is exactly what they will try and do. And with the example of the revolutionary Americans to look to, the National Assembly will produce one of the great statements of the French Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

## 3.13a- The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. The representatives of the French people, constituted as a national assembly, and considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man, are the sole cause of public misfortunes and governmental corruption, have resolved to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, inalienable, and sacred rights of man, so that, by being constantly present to all the members of the social body, this declaration may always remind them of their rights and duties, so that, by being liable at every moment to comparison with the aim of any and all political institutions, the acts of the legislative and executive powers may be more fully respected, and so that, by being founded henceforward on simple and incontestable principles, the demands of the citizens may always tend towards maintaining the Constitution and the general welfare. In consequence, the national assembly recognizes and declares, in the presence and under the auspices of the Supreme Being, the following rights of man and the citizen. 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on the common good.

[(01:34)](#!):

2. The purpose of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imperscriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. 3. The principle of all sovereignty rests essentially in the nation. No body and no individual may exercise authority which does not emanate expressly from the nation.

[(02:02)](#!):

4. Liberty consists in the ability to do whatever does not harm another. Hence, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no other limits than those which assure to other members of society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law. 5. The law only has the right to prohibit those actions which are injurious to society. No hindrance should be put in the way of anything nor prohibited by the law, nor may anyone be forced to do what the law does not require. 6. The law is an expression of the general will.

[(02:43)](#!):

All citizens have the right to take part, in person or by their representatives, in its formation. It must be the same for everyone, whether it protects or penalizes. All citizens being equal in its eyes are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices, and employments, according to their abilities and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.

[(03:07)](#!):

7. No man may be indicted, arrested, or detained except in cases determined by the law and according to the forms which it has prescribed. Those who seek, expedite, execute, or cause to be executed, arbitrary orders should be punished, but citizens summoned or seized by the virtue of the law should obey instantly and not render themselves guilty by resistance. 8. Only strictly and obviously necessary punishments may be established by the law, and no one may be punished except by virtue of a law established and promulgated before the time of the offense, then legally applied.

[(03:48)](#!):

9. Every man being presumed innocent until judged guilty, if it is deemed indispensable to arrest him, all rigor unnecessary to securing his person should be severely repressed by the law. 10. No one should be disturbed for his opinions, even in religion, provided that their manifestation does not trouble public order as established by law. 11. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may therefore speak, write, and print freely, if he accepts his own responsibility for any abuse of this liberty in the cases set by the law.

[(04:29)](#!):

12. The safeguard of the rights of man and the citizen requires public powers. These powers are therefore instituted for the advantage of all and not for the private benefit of those whom they are entrusted. 13. For maintenance of public authority and for the expenses of administration, common taxation is indispensable. It should be apportioned equally among all the citizens, according to their capacity to pay.

[(04:57)](#!):

14. All citizens have the right, by themselves or through their representatives, to have as demonstrated to them the necessity of public taxes, to consent to them freely, to follow the use made of the proceeds, and to determine the means of apportionment, assessment, and collection, and the duration of them. 15. Society has the right to hold accountable every public agent of the administration. 16. Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured or the separation of powers not settled has no constitution.

[(05:34)](#!):

17. A property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one may be deprived of it, except when public necessity, certified by law, obviously requires it, and on the condition of a just compensation in advance.

This time, I am going to recommend The Black Count by Tim Rees, a narrative history of one of the more interesting and little-known characters from the French Revolution, Thomas Alexandre Dumas, the father of the famous novelist. Dumas was the Haitian-born son of a French nobleman and his African slave, who would go on to live a pretty crazy life, rising to the rank of general in the revolutionary armies, commander of the cavalry during Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign. Then he gets captured, he gets thrown in prison, and when he finally gets back, he’s shunned by all his former comrades. It’s a pretty amazing story.

[(01:30)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.13 The Rights of Man On the morning of August the 5th, 1789, the delegates of the National Assembly woke up with a bit of a legislative hangover. The night before had turned into a raucous orgy of bold and far-reaching declarations, denunciations, and renunciations. But now that it was morning, and whatever the Breton Club had put into the water the night before had worn off, it was time to take stock of just what they had done.

[(02:14)](#!):

And though in general the delegates were pleased with what they had accomplished, and they were optimistic about what it would all mean for the future of France, it appeared that some of the declarations might have been a bit too sweeping, some of the denunciations too pointed, and some of the renunciations, well obviously there will have to be some qualifications and exceptions that still need to be worked out. The delegates, after all, were pretty uniformly committed to protecting private property, and all those feudal rights and privileges were very much considered a form of property. If you’ll recall from way back in episode 3.1 when we were first going through the three states, one of the reasons upwardly mobile commoners liked to buy noble titles was because they were a good investment that came with all those little automatic revenue streams. So the deconstruction of feudalism could never go on without those being stripped of their property, being compensated for the loss. It was only fair.

[(03:06)](#!):

So on August the 11th, the National Assembly drew up a more sober version of the August 4th declarations. Though the preamble stated flatly that, quote, the National Assembly entirely destroys the feudal regime, end quote, the August 11th decree made it clear that you could only get out from under your feudal obligations if you bought your way out according to a clearly spelled out legal path that you can read as soon as we’re done writing it. And while this decree was designed to keep the process of deconstructing feudalism within reasonable bounds that respected private property and the rule of law, in practice it had to have very little effect. By the time this all filtered out to the peasantry, all they heard was the National Assembly entirely destroys the feudal regime, and so they just stopped paying their dues and obligations. It would take years of fruitless pursuit of the required buyouts to convince property holders to just give it up, and by then the revolution had taken a few more radical turns and the requirement for compensation was eventually dropped.

[(04:07)](#!):

But the August 11th decree did have one immediately helpful effect. It really did help mollify the angry peasantry, and with the harvest now coming due, the great fear that had swept the provinces dissipated by the end of August 1789. One of the big impacts of the political tornado that had just ripped through France from the fall of the Bastille to the great fear to the night of August the 4th was that it redrew the political lines within the National Assembly. Men who had stood side-by-side in the fight for the Third Estate, and had literally stood side-by-side reciting the tennis court oath, were now beginning to break into opposing camps.

[(04:49)](#!):

Specifically, the alliance between the more conservative delegates from Dauphine and the more radical delegates from Brittany broke down. Nothing successfully merged the orders into a single assembly, the ultimate objectives of these two factions now pointed them in opposite directions. The men from Dauphine were horrified by the sweeping unrest, the attacks on noble estates, the out-and-out rebellion in Paris.

[(05:13)](#!):

They were after stability and order. The men from Brittany, on the other hand, along with their new friends from Paris, were perfectly willing to exploit all this mob action to ensure that the political revolution kept moving in the right direction. They weren’t in favor of mob action, mind you, just that, hey, if that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes. But after successfully engineering the events of August the 4th, the influence of the Breton Club went into a period of decline, and the influence of Meunier and the Dauphine group steadily rose.

[(05:46)](#!):

Meunier and his associates seemed to stand for a sane and sober way forward, occupying the middle ground between the unsettling radicalism of the Bretons and the Parisians and the really unsettling reactionary position of the arch-conservatives.

[(05:60)](#!):

Meunier’s program could best be described as constitutional royalism, and the delegates who fell into his orbit were soon dubbed the Meunarchian. Hopefully I’ve got that right. It reads in English like monarchian, to give you an idea of where the name came from. They wanted reform, and they wanted a rational constitution for France, but they still had respect for traditional order. They believed now more than ever in a strong central government, in case you haven’t noticed, the provinces are like literally on fire, but they also believed in constitutional government and the rule of law, and respect for the rights of citizens.

[(06:34)](#!):

Meunier himself described their attitude as quote, sensible, deliberate, moderate, and cool. In the wake of the midsummer crisis, this became an enormously attractive position. The Meunarchian started to draw in adherents and drive the assembly’s business. To aid in this drive, Meunier and his allies set up a small executive committee that would decide which way to vote on a motion, or which person should be elected to a vacant office. Then they would distribute little slips of paper to their like-minded colleagues, and suddenly unified voting blocs started showing up in the national assembly for the first time. It helped by way of contrast that the Breton Club was essentially a free-wheeling debate society, with an emphasis on democratic principles and individual free thinking. So when it came time to elect a new secretary or president or whatever, the Meunarchian were unified and the Bretons were not, so the Meunarchian started to dominate the leadership positions as summer gave way to fall.

[(07:34)](#!):

But that was not quite enough on its own to skew the assembly in a more conservative direction, and Meunier got some help from two other sources.

[(07:42)](#!):

First were all those sulking arch-conservatives who were opposed to everything that had happened since the convening of the Estates General. Now sitting in the national assembly pretty much against their will, they had so far been bowled over by the rush of events. But with the help of our old friend and ex-parliament leader, de Premenil, they too had taken to meeting after hours, plotting strategy and building a unified voting bloc. These reactionary conservatives, though, quickly determined that they did not have the juice on their own to just bend the assembly to their will, so they had to form a working alliance with the more moderate Meunarchian, and de Premenil got himself a seat on Meunier’s decision-making committee.

[(08:24)](#!):

Then there was the clergy. As you’ll recall, the first Estate delegations were mostly full of ordinary parish priests sympathetic to the grievances of the Third Estate. These priests had been the first to cross the line that divided up the Estates General, and thus they had helped found the new National Assembly. But after everything that had just happened, they began to follow Meunier into moderate conservatism. They hadn’t been too keen on the explosive violence in Paris\xe2\x80\x94the destruction of the Abbey Saint-Lazare was particularly galling\xe2\x80\x94but it was the night of August the 4th that really started to divorce them from the radicals. The abolition of tithes had pretty much come out of nowhere. The basic position of the parish priest was that tithes ought to be collected more equitably and distributed more evenly, not that they be abolished. It didn’t help that in the initial negotiations with the Third Estate, the clergy had been given every assurance that should they come over and join them, that church property would not be touched. And then, adding insult to injury, when on August the 11th, the National Assembly walked back some of what had happened on August the 4th, the abolition of tithes remained. The clergy was not very happy about it.

[(09:35)](#!):

With the Munartian, the arch-conservatives, and the clergy aligning somewhere to the right of wherever the new middle was, the more radical delegates found themselves in a distinct minority, and after August the 11th, they had a very difficult time directing the Assembly’s business. But remember, the National Assembly has close to a thousand guys in it, and at least a third of those delegates couldn’t be said to have any real allegiance at all. So though the radicals and the conservatives were themselves polarizing into these mutually exclusive little parties, the middle was still very fluid, and votes still went back and forth because it was almost impossible for any one faction to completely control the Assembly, which is something that is often pointed to as a reason the course of the French Revolution keeps slipping from any one group’s grasp.

[(10:23)](#!):

The issue that really started to crystallize the growing divide within the National Assembly was the matter of what France’s new political constitution would look like.

[(10:32)](#!):

Now I haven’t talked about this a lot because there were far more pressing events to cover, but from the beginning, it had been taken for granted by almost all the delegates, well not the third of state delegates anyway, that one of the central purposes of the National Assembly would be to produce a written constitution for France. When they took the tennis court oath, the key provision had been that they would not disband until France had a new constitution. This writing of a new constitution became so central to the National Assembly’s identity that back on July the 7th, they had voted to rename themselves the National Constituent Assembly. So to keep things simple, I’m just going to keep calling them the National Assembly, or just the Assembly, since it’s still the same body, and a lot of people even at the time just kept referring to it as such. But if you read around about the French Revolution, the Assembly will as often as not be referred to from here on out as the Constituent Assembly. It’s all the same thing, just different names.

[(11:34)](#!):

A few days after this little name change, the Marquis de Lafayette came forward, a move that the new constitution they would soon be drafting ought to be prefaced by a formal Declaration of Rights.

[(11:45)](#!):

But he introduced this motion on July the 11th. And of course, the next day, Jacques Necker was dismissed from office, and all hell broke loose in Paris. It was not until weeks later that the Assembly returned to the question of whether to draft a written Declaration of Rights. Meunier and his allies objected, believing that a specific list of rights would create too many unrealizable expectations in the public at large. But over these objections, the delegates approved the motion on the afternoon of\xe2\x80\xa6 August the 4th. That is, just hours before the night of August the 4th. And with all the fallout from that fateful night, the Declaration of Rights was once again put on the back burner.

[(12:26)](#!):

But since this was Lafayette’s little pet project, he kept pushing it forward, believing that the resulting statement of principles would elevate the dignity of the burgeoning revolution, and would help justify all the fighting, both verbal and physical, that had consumed France over the last few months.

[(12:44)](#!):

So Lafayette spent the first weeks of August working on a rough draft, drawing from the general principles of the Enlightenment, the specific writings of Montesquieu and Rousseau, and then various examples coming from the American colonies. And he sought guidance from the American ambassador to France, Thomas Jefferson, who was only too happy to help the excitable Lafayette get his thoughts down in language befitting the moment. Lafayette’s draft then passed under the pen of master orator and propagandist, the Comte de Mirabeau, who I have criminally neglected thus far, and who I may as well shoehorn into the story right now before he gets too far away from me.

[(13:23)](#!):

Honore Gabrielle Riccati, the Comte de Mirabeau, was born in 1749, the fifth child and second son of a noble family. At the age of three, he survived a bout with smallpox that left his face permanently disfigured. This, along with his soon growing to be a great hulk of a man, meant that he stood out in every crowd he was ever in. The young Mirabeau then made himself even harder to ignore by embarking on a scandalous path of black sheepery that included numerous high-profile affairs, the accrual of massive gambling debts, and the blackmailing of a wealthy widow into marrying him.

[(14:01)](#!):

He was a frequent target of lettres de cachet, and found himself in various states of imprisonment or exile all through his early years, often bouncing back and forth between France, where there were always charges hovering around him, and the United Provinces, where he would get by hiring his pen to anyone who would pay him to say whatever they wanted him to say. In the early 1780s, while enduring another round of imprisonment, Mirabeau penetrated the popular consciousness by writing a fierce denunciation of lettres de cachet, gee I wonder why, but also by publishing a series of pretty dirty love letters between himself and a girl named Sophie, which became a bestseller.

[(14:43)](#!):

After being released, he returned to the United Provinces and quickly made himself a ton of enemies by publishing an attack on financial speculators. So he hopped over to Berlin for a while, where he gathered material for his best-selling takedown of the entire Prussian monarchy, the Secret History of the Court of Berlin. The work was vicious enough, and popular enough, that it actually became something of a diplomatic incident, right as the Prussians were deciding whether or not to invade the United Provinces in 1787, and the French Royal Ministry promised to suppress the book.

[(15:16)](#!):

With the political situation deteriorating by the end of the 1780s, Mirabeau joined Adrien Dupour’s group of liberal nobles, the Society of Thirty, and when the Estates-General finally did get called, Mirabeau went out looking for a constituency, and wound up getting elected by the good people of X. He was, along with Meunier and Bailly, one of the few delegates from the Third Estate with a national name, and in his case, face, recognition. He stood out in the crowd, he wore ostentatious clothes, and he started positioning himself as a key leader in the Third Estate. He was the one who had dared the king to send troops, when the Third Estate delegates refused to break up after that failed royal session back in June.

[(15:58)](#!):

With the chaos of the midsummer crisis swirling, though, he came down squarely on the side of the more moderate Munartian, and he probably helped moderate some of the more fanciful language in Lafayette’s original drafts for the Declaration of Rights.

[(16:13)](#!):

Okay, so getting back to it, by the last week of August, the final rough drafts of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was ready for the Assembly to take up. Now I’ve gone ahead and recorded a little supplemental of the verbatim text, so I won’t go through it all point by point. But in general, what the Declaration of Rights did was enshrine for all time the so-called principles of 1789, the capstone of enlightened 18th century political philosophy. Individuals had natural rights that had to be respected, including liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. Political sovereignty lay with the whole nation, rather than some divinely appointed king. Protection by citizens in their own government was a prerequisite for any law or tax to be considered legal. The rule of law was essential to a just society, and that law was to be considered the expression of the general will. A rather nebulous concept developed by Rousseau that, as we will see, will wind up being surprisingly easy to divorce from something so pedestrian as the majority will, leading to tiny little cliques with their own hyper-specific agendas being able to justify practically anything because they were the true representatives of the general will. But we’ll get to all that down the road.

[(17:34)](#!):

Now though what came out of this debate over the exact wording was substantially what had been fed into it, the Declaration of Rights was tempered in a few key places by the increasingly conservative voters. For example, Article I begins, Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. But this wound up qualified by, Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good. So the principle of equality was established, but so too was the principle of social hierarchy, though this hierarchy did have to be founded on the general good, whatever that meant.

[(18:14)](#!):

A few articles later, the dream of complete freedom of thought and worship ran into stiff resistance from the clerical delegates, and would be modified to say that freedom of thought was fine so long as it did not threaten public order. And it didn’t take too much of an imagination to picture a place down the road where any challenge to the Catholic Church would in and of itself be considered a threat to public order, and the ode to free thinking and the Declaration of Rights would simply be gutted.

[(18:42)](#!):

And this gets at something inherent about the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. It was a statement of aspiration, rather than a set of legal guidelines, sort of like the American Bill of Rights. Between the vague language and the total impracticality of putting it into effect overnight, the Declaration stood for what these delegates thought France ought to be aiming for, not codifying what it had already accomplished. It was finally passed on August the 26th, 1789, and immediately became the holy scripture of the French Revolution.

[(19:17)](#!):

So the last thing we should probably talk about before we move on is who this all actually applies to, because that and of the citizen business is important. Though it wouldn’t be worked out formally for a few months, the National Assembly would soon divide the French population into two types of people, active citizens and passive citizens. Active citizens in a nutshell meant property-holding males over the age of 25 who could not be classified as a servant. This was perfectly in keeping with enlightened political philosophy that assumed you couldn’t possibly have a say in government unless you had an ownership stake in the nation. So of the nearly 30 million people living in France, active citizenship could only be claimed by about 4 million people, and as the years passed and the revolution just kept trucking along, this distinction between active and passive citizens would become a major problem, especially once the Saint-Qulottes, that is the poor workers in Paris, started flexing their political muscle, clearly determined to prove that there was absolutely nothing passive about their citizenship.

[(20:23)](#!):

With the soon-to-be-hallowed Declaration of Rights now completed, the National Assembly was forced to turn to what would come after the visionary preamble, that is, the nuts and bolts of the written constitution itself. To begin the process, an eight-man committee was established to hopefully pick through some of the thornier issues before the full assembly was asked to start voting on things.

[(20:46)](#!):

Meunier, of course, got himself appointed along with a few of his Meunarchian associates, but so too did the Abbe CS and a few of his more radical friends. So the committee was deadlocked over most of the key issues. Would there be one legislative chamber or two? How big would those chambers be? How often would they be elected? Who would be electing them? What would the scope of their powers be? On almost every point, the two sides disagreed, with Meunier constantly pushing for a British-style system with a lower house and an upper house and lots of prerogatives left to the king, so a truly mixed monarchy. The radicals, on the other hand, wanted a more democratic single chamber that would essentially be the government of France, with the king there to execute their decrees and maybe host a fancy party now and again.

[(21:34)](#!):

But the really big sticking point, and the one that truly flung them in opposite directions, was the matter of the royal veto. The Meunarchians said the king should have an absolute and unlimited veto. The radicals said he should have no veto at all. And this was a fantastically important question because it would define the power relationship between the king and the assembly. Would he become their puppet, or would they be reduced to his window dressing? In short, who was going to wear the pants in the new order? Or I guess more specifically, who would wear the culottes?

[(22:12)](#!):

For the radicals, this debate over the constitution was deadly serious, because it was becoming clear to them that they were being outmaneuvered routinely by the Meunarchian. If that kept up, and the king got ahold of an unlimited veto, everything that had been accomplished would soon be chucked out in the trash. So on the night of August the 30th, very possibly at the instigation of radical delegates within the assembly, a mob started gathering in Paris, intending to march on Versailles. But as it turned out, Paris wasn’t quite ready to follow up on the mid-July mob actions, and only a few hundred turned out, and they were easily contained by Lafayette’s National Guardsmen. It would, however, not be too long before Paris was ready to follow up on the mid-July mob actions, and Lafayette’s National Guardsmen wouldn’t even come close to containing them.

[(23:04)](#!):

By early September 1789, stubborn anger within the constitutional committee prevented the two sides from agreeing on anything, and the Marquis de Lafayette started to despair a little bit. He was an idealistic guy, and not a little bit dreamy, and he didn’t like that the grand pronouncements of the Declaration of Rights was being sucked down by factional bickering among former friends and allies. So he picked some neutral ground \xe2\x80\x94 Thomas Jefferson’s house in Paris, as it turned out \xe2\x80\x94 and he invited a few key players to come parlay. Representing the Meunarchian was Meunier and two of his colleagues from Dauphine. Representing the Radicals were three leaders who had recently started working very closely and very well together, and who will soon rise up to a dominant position within the assembly \xe2\x80\x94 Adrien Dupour, Alexandre de la Mette, and Antoine Barnouve.

[(23:57)](#!):

This trio would soon be dubbed the Triumvirate, and we’ll be talking much more about them as the revolution races on. But just to give you a little thumbnail to work with, Adrien Dupour was, remember, that young liberal noble magistrate who helped lead the Paris parlement in their fight with the ministry. Alexandre de la Mette had served as an officer in the American Revolution along with Lafayette, and upon his return had become a vocal leader for liberal progress. And then Antoine Barnouve, who was himself a member of the Dauphine delegation, and who had been on the front lines during all that Day of the Tiles stuff.

[(24:33)](#!):

Meunier and Barnouve were friends. But where Meunier had reacted to the events of the last few months by locking into a more conservative worldview, Barnouve had become more radicalized. That said, the Triumvirate of Dupour, de la Mette, and Barnouve came to the meeting at Jefferson’s house willing to make some kind of compromise. Meunier, though, dug in his heels, believing this now to be a matter of principle. He stuck his flag on a full and unlimited veto for the king, and he refused to talk any more about it.

[(25:07)](#!):

With this attempt at compromise failed, the deadlocked constitutional committee then kicked the question to the full assembly and planned to let the chips fall where they may. When this debate hit the floor, it became clear that though Meunier’s Meunarchian were better organized, and that the great mass of uncommitted delegates were probably inclined to support his brand of constitutional royalism, those uncommitted delegates were as nervous as the radicals about giving the king an unlimited veto.

[(25:36)](#!):

So it was into this mix that Jacques Necker made his only real contribution to the political situation after his recall following the storming of the Bastille. His trip back from the frontier had been a rolling party, and he had been cheered through every town he passed. But when he got back to Versailles, it turned out that he really didn’t have a master plan to save France, the king now hated him with a passion, and the national assembly was gaining enough self-confidence to not really need the controller general dictating policy anymore. Though for all the fighting over the fate of Jacques Necker, he’s basically going to leave the stage of history not with a bang but a whimper, because the next time he gets tossed out of the ministry, no one is even going to lift a finger in protest. He was already old news.

[(26:19)](#!):

So his last little contribution was suggesting that the king be given a Suspensive Veto. That is, the king could delay legislation but not stop it permanently if the people willed it, whatever that meant.

[(26:33)](#!):

The Suspensive Veto was greeted pretty enthusiastically by the uncommitted delegates as a nice compromise. But even the Suspensive Veto was fraught with danger for everyone because the devil would be in the details. How long would the suspension last? Weeks? Months? Years? And what could override it? A simple majority vote? A supermajority? Something more? A popular referendum? Would the sitting session be allowed to take up the question or would it have to wait until after the next election? So on the one extreme, this could all be as easy as pie. The king issues a veto, a week later the assembly overrides it, and that’s it. The king is powerless.

[(27:14)](#!):

On the other extreme, it could be set up where you had to wait through multiple elections to be held and even then require a supermajority vote, meaning that unless the king was insanely out of touch with public opinion, his temporary veto would, in practice, be permanent.

[(27:31)](#!):

So Meunier fought hard against the Suspensive Veto, but he was finally undone by the very man he was trying to give the unlimited veto to because the king let it be known that he himself would now be in favor of a Suspensive Veto, and that if he were allowed to have a say in the override formula, that he would further sign his name to the August 11 Declaration and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, giving both an ironclad aura of legality that they had so far been lacking.

[(28:02)](#!):

But before the vote on the veto was taken up, the assembly sidetracked onto another issue dear to Meunier’s heart. Whether France’s new legislative body would have an upper and a lower house, or whether it would just be one unified chamber. By an overwhelming majority of 849 to 211, the single house was approved. This vote, though, is a little bit misleading. The radicals wanted it because they thought it would be more democratic and representative of the general will. They were joined by poor nobles, who were afraid simply that courtier super nobles would come to dominate the upper house and then punt the poor nobles right back out of power.

[(28:44)](#!):

The single house formula was also cynically supported by most of the arch conservatives, who believed that it would be highly unstable and thus hasten the demise of this disgusting little revolution. With that settled, the assembly debated the question of the veto on September the 12th. An initial roll call showed no clear consensus. No veto got 220 votes, full veto got 325, and the suspenseive veto got 450, including votes from the coming triumvirate of Dupour, Lamette, and Barnoff.

[(29:23)](#!):

On the next vote, the radicals switched sides and threw their support to the suspenseive veto, because some veto is better than no veto. And so it finally won 673 to 325. With two of his most cherished ideas now defeated, Meunier resigned the constitutional committee. But this dramatic gesture was a signal of nothing more than Meunier’s injured pride. Because as I said, the devil was going to be in the details on all this.

[(29:51)](#!):

With Louis’ input, the Meunarshian quickly organized and pushed through the motion defining the terms of the suspenseive veto that had just won. And what they got was this. Three legislative sessions had to pass before the king’s veto could be addressed by the assembly, and no appeal to the people would ever be a part of it. Depending on the intervals between sessions, this meant that something like four to six years might very well pass before a veto could be overwritten. So just like that, in all ordinary times and under all ordinary circumstances, the king had his permanent veto.

[(30:28)](#!):

The shocked radicals, riding high on what they just thought was a nice little victory, were completely devastated. Then at the end of September, another slate of vacancies in the assembly leadership needed to be filled, and the Meunarshian all but ran the table. Meunier himself was elected president. The disenchanted radicals now talked openly of just quitting the national assembly completely. Whatever the revolution had been promising, it was sure starting to look like it would never be fulfilled.

[(30:59)](#!):

But next week, the tide will suddenly turn, and as happens so often, events will start to take on a life of their own. And what will begin in early October, as a protest among Paris housewives over the continuing bread shortages, will turn into a dramatic march on Versailles that would change the course of the revolution.

Episode 3.14, The Women’s March on Versailles. So last time, we talked about the conservative-ish reaction in the National Assembly to the chaos of the summer of 1789. The Declaration of the Rights of Man had been passed, sure.

[(02:08)](#!):

But as France’s new political constitution began to take shape, the moderately conservative Munartian, led by Jean-Joseph Meunier, had taken over the Assembly. The king had been given what looked an awful lot like a permanent veto over future legislation, and he still hadn’t signed the August 11 Decree or the Declaration of the Rights of Man. As a result of all this, the radicals in the Assembly started getting a little depressed about how things were shaking out. They thought the drama of the last few months was going to blast France into a new age. But now it seems like maybe the old days were going to start coming back bit by little bit.

[(02:45)](#!):

But today, the pendulum is going to swing wildly back into the radicals’ favor. And in the span of just about 24 hours in early October 1789, the conservative tilt will be reversed, and France will once again find itself hurtling into new and uncharted territory. So we left off last time in mid-September 1789 with the vote to give the king a Suspensive Veto, which in theory seemed like a nice check on his powers, but which was then drawn up to be almost impossible to overturn in practice.

[(03:17)](#!):

Though these votes looked reasonable to the delegates within the Assembly\xe2\x80\x94after all, they were the ones voting for them\xe2\x80\x94when word got back to Paris what the Assembly had just done, it did not look anywhere near reasonable to the Parisians.

[(03:30)](#!):

It looked to them like the Revolution was about to be sold out. And as you will recall, agitators in Paris had basically declared themselves to be the defenders of the Revolution. Up until now, that had meant defending the National Assembly. But if they themselves turned against the people, then ought not the Assembly be purged? Ought not the evil aristocrats pulling the strings behind the scenes be strung up on the nearest lamppost? Sentiments along these lines started filling the pages of the daily and weekly newspapers that were now flooding off the Paris presses.

[(04:02)](#!):

The whole newspaper industry had just been growing exponentially ever since the summer of 1788\xe2\x80\x94that was back when Archbishop Brienne had invited the nation to chime in on how the Estates General should be formed. This open invitation to publish meant that anyone could just set up shop one day, start putting out a paper where he could say whatever he wanted to say. And so, just as the debate over the King’s veto swirled, one such anyone decided it was time to get in on the action, and push back strongly against those who would betray the Revolution. On September the 12th, 1789, new daily newspapers started up that would soon be called La Mi du Publ\xc3\xa8, the friend of the people. The sole writer, editor, and publisher was a wily little piece of\xe2\x80\xa6 name Jean-Paul Marat.

[(04:51)](#!):

Jean-Paul Marat was born in what is now Switzerland in 1741. He moved to France at 16, and got set up as a tutor to children of a merchant trader in Bordeaux. After that, he moved to Paris to study medicine, but never completed his degree. In 1765, he moved up to London and started climbing his way into the world of Enlightenment discourse, with a particular focus on science and political philosophy. He moved up to Newcastle a few years later, and a paper he wrote earned him a degree from St. Andrews.

[(05:22)](#!):

After ten years in England, he returned to Paris in 1776, and finagled his way into an appointment as physician to the personal bodyguard of the Comte d’Artois. This opened up a lot of doors for him, and he was soon earning pretty good money as a doctor to various aristocratic families. Marat then used the money he earned to fund his real passion, which turned out to be scientific research. In those days, practically everything was open to the new principles of scientific experimentation. And so, convinced of his own genius, Marat spent a lot of time trying to disprove the laws of Newton. And though he never quite pulled it off, he did publish a few well-regarded papers about optics. In 1786, he abandoned his medical practice to focus on his scientific pursuits full-time, though he did still crank out political commentary from time to time, including an essay on judicial reform. When the pre-revolutionary breakdown of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime really started to break down though, Marat dove headfirst into the middle of it, and he restyled himself as a staunch advocate for the rights of the Third Estate, and he himself published an essay that closely tracked the ideas in C.S.’s more famous work, What is the Third Estate?

[(06:35)](#!):

The whole ordeal of 1789 then pushed Marat firmly on the path to political agitation, and as the debate over the Constitution swirled, he actually got some of his ideas introduced on the floor of the National Assembly. Then, as the tide seemed to be turning against the revolution, Marat launched the Friend of the People, and from that platform became the quintessential revolutionary polemicist. In time, he would go completely overboard and be a one-man engine for the bloody mania that was on the way. But for now, all he was calling for was the purging of the National Assembly of all conservatives and the stringing up of aristocratic swine. Pretty crazy stuff for the times, but man, not nearly as crazy as Marat is going to get.

[(07:20)](#!):

Marat found a particularly willing audience for his special brand of overheated rhetoric in the fall of 1789 for many of the same reasons Paris had gone into revolt back in July. Hunger, stress, and fear.

[(07:34)](#!):

Because though the harvest had finally come in and there probably was enough grain to go around, the weather had turned unseasonably dry, which left a lot of the creeks and rivers and streams that ran the flour mills too weak to grind the grain into flour. I mean, plants cannot catch a break here. By the end of September, bread was once again scarce and prices were sky high. Added to this was the fact that October the 1st was another one of those semi-annual deadlines for the settling of debts. Just as had happened back in July, when the King and the National Assembly appeared to be turning their backs on the revolution, they were doing it at a moment when the people of Paris were hungry and stressed out and very afraid. Paranoid rumors again started taking hold among the lower classes that the aristocrats were plotting to starve them out and trample their recently proclaimed rights and liberties. But the paranoia at that moment absolutely cut both ways, and more well-to-do citizens in Paris were always looking over their shoulder just waiting for that gang of ruffians on the corner to march over and lynch them just for having a silk shirt. The capital was an extraordinarily tense place to be living in in the fall of 1789.

[(08:45)](#!):

With the atmosphere in Paris recharging, the Marquis de Lafayette and his newly organized National Guard found themselves scrambling to keep order. Lafayette had taken a page from Washington’s playbook and tried to instill in his newly formed regiments of citizen recruits a professional and patriotic esprit de corps. He designed and arranged for uniforms. He perfected the tricolor by adding the white of the Bourbons to the blue and red revolutionary cocaine. After all, the monarchy was not going to be overthrown, it was going to be a partner in the new constitutional regime.

[(09:18)](#!):

Then Lafayette had his men swear all kinds of loyalty oaths to the nation. But their loyalties were immediately tested when grain riots started breaking out in the municipalities surrounding Paris, and then further when the grain that eventually made its way to the capital started being surrounded by gangs of housewives who had come to keep an eye on things, to make sure the grain didn’t get hoarded, and to make sure it was all sold at a fair price. Eventually men from the National Guard had to be posted at every bakery to protect the bakers from getting torn limb from limb when they ran out of bread for the day, which happened way too frequently, and way too early in the morning.

[(09:53)](#!):

But as we are about to see, though they were currently being deployed to preserve order, when push came to shove the rank and file of the National Guard were far more loyal to the hungry women waiting in line for bread than their own fancy-pants leader Lafayette, who, for all his enlightened talk, was still just another aristocrat with a nice full belly. Now ironically, one of the key sparks that lit the fuse for everything that’s about to happen was not supposed to be a spark at all. It was supposed to be the opposite of that. It was supposed to be a wet, smothering blanket that would stop future explosions.

[(10:27)](#!):

On September the 14th, that is, just a few days after the Suspensive Veto was passed, King Louis got together with his war minister and decided that in the interest of palace security they should call in from the northeastern frontier the Flanders Regiment. The Flanders Regiment was the crack in his crack squad in the French army. Close knit and highly disciplined, they could be counted on to provide the king a formidable defense should some great angry mob try to come calling in the middle of the night. But more than that, their very presence was supposed to warn off that angry mob before it even got going. Instead, as we will see in just one moment, it sucked in that angry mob like a moth to a flame. But it wasn’t just the Flanders Regiment that was the problem. Because after the king ordered them to come reinforce Versailles, Louis then decided to start waffling a bit on the promises he had just made to the National Assembly. Remember, he had basically said, give me a Suspensive Veto and let me help draw up the details, and I’ll sign on to the August 11 Decree and the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

[(11:32)](#!):

Well, now that he had his veto, on the terms that he wanted, he turned around and said, you know, look, I like most of what’s in the August 11 Decree, but I can’t support all of it. And as if that alone wasn’t bad enough, one of the problems he pointed to was that it took insufficient account of the rights of German princes out on the borderlands who owned French property or had family claims to French noble privileges.

[(11:55)](#!):

The moderate, uncommitted delegates who filled the center of the National Assembly now felt betrayed. They had negotiated a deal with the king in good faith, and now he was going to try to double-cross them so he could help the Germans? I mean, who cares about the Germans? And oh, by the way, if you’re looking to clamp down on rumors that the royal family is plotting with foreign powers against the people of France, maybe double-crossing the National Assembly as a favorite of some German princes isn’t maybe your best play right now. So once again, Louis’ vacillation is coming into play. He wouldn’t follow through on the hard line his wife and family had advocated, and now he wouldn’t follow through on the softer line public opinion seemed to demand. The guy just had no follow-through on anything, and mostly what he wanted to do was go out hunting, which is what he did almost every day through arguably the most critical months in the whole history of France.

[(12:46)](#!):

King Louis was I think a decent and sensitive guy, but he was not a very good leader. When the king started making noises about amending the decrees, the National Assembly came back and said no, sign the thing as it stands and just get it out there. So what Louis did was say fine, I’ll publish it, but I won’t promulgate it. Now I’m personally a little unclear honestly about the technical difference, but there definitely was one, and I’m sure officially promulgating something means it goes out through whatever official mechanism the monarchy had for disseminating its decrees, while publishing meant just that and nothing more. You guys figure out how to distribute it, and this of course was taken as an insult.

[(13:28)](#!):

So just as the king is playing this game with the National Assembly, the Flanders Regiment shows up, which in and of itself was not as troubling as the welcome that they received at the palace. First the conservative nobles and the royal family were openly jubilant to see this stiff reinforcement of troops now here to protect them for whatever the rabble might try and do. And when the conservative nobles and the royal family are jubilant, everyone else starts to get a little edgy.

[(13:54)](#!):

Then on October the 1st, a welcome banquet was held in their honor. Now it does not matter in the slightest what actually happened at the banquet that night. All that matters is what was reported to have happened. The first account started to be published the very next day in Paris. First there were the regimental toasts, the endless rounds of toasts, and in the endless rounds there was not one, not a single one to the nation, the foundation of all sovereignty. That was a conspicuous oversight. But more galling was the report that someone had taken the revolutionary cocky, thrown it on the ground, and trampled it beneath his boots. That was a flagrant provocation. And what was worse, the king and the queen had somewhat unconventionally come down to the banquet themselves, so clearly this all met with their hearty approval.

[(14:44)](#!):

So by now everything is adding up. The new veto power, the backtracking on signing his name or promulgating the revolutionary declarations, the lack of bread in Paris, the presence of the Flanders regiment, and now this public degradation of the physical symbol of the revolution. Clearly some kind of conservative coup was in the making. Then the king added one more affront to the list. On October the 4th he said he wasn’t too sure about the Declaration of the Rights of Men either, and he didn’t want to sign it unless a few small changes could be made here and there. All of these ingredients were thrown into a pot that finally boiled over on what the French now call the October Journ\xc3\xa9e, or the October Days, which is a little formula that they use to designate the big popular uprisings of the revolution. So we’ll have the Journ\xc3\xa9e of June the 20th and the Journ\xc3\xa9e of August the 10th, that’s a really super big one. There’s actually a bunch of them over the next decade. But don’t worry, we’ll get to them all and in the order that they come.

[(15:45)](#!):

So on to the October Days. On the morning of October the 5th, 1789, the people of Paris awoke to the sound of church bells ringing. These bells had started ringing at the rather intimidating request of a group of really super angry housewives who were organizing a mass demonstration to protest the lack of bread, the high prices for bread, and the unscrupulous merchants who were profiting from the people’s misery. Just the night before, a baker had narrowly escaped being lynched, but was saved by a few National Guardsmen.

[(16:16)](#!):

On the fateful morning of October the 5th, General Lafayette was out of the city and the officer left in charge of central Paris had spread his men pretty thin. So when some six or seven thousand angry women suddenly started congregating outside the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, the Guardsmen left in the neighborhood were just totally outnumbered. With no one really to stop them, the women then busted into the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville and started collecting all the weapons, the guns, and the cannons that they could find. I mean, this is some serious public disorder. The officer in charge of the National Guard was about to order his men to try to do something about all this when he was bluntly told, look, sir, we’re not going to fire on these ladies, so don’t even think about it.

[(16:57)](#!):

So the angry wives and mothers of Paris were allowed to just carry on as they pleased. It actually got to the point where the women were about to light the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville on fire and then someone suggested that dealing with the Paris city government was pointless and what they needed to do was go straight to the source where the impotent King Louis and his Austrian whore wife sat fat on their throne spitting on the cockades and plotting to kill them all. So they about faced and marched off in the direction of Versailles, picking up new recruits wherever they went.

[(17:28)](#!):

Lafayette meanwhile was hustling back into town, but with the city immobilized by the demonstration he did not reach the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville until 11 in the morning. There he found the women gone, but his men still waiting patiently for him, ready for the order to take off for Versailles themselves.

[(17:45)](#!):

But it became immediately apparent to Lafayette that the men wanted to march off not to stop the demonstrators, but to join them. The idea had already taken root in the rank and file that the best way to preserve the revolution would be to dismiss the offensive Flanders regiment and substitute themselves as the King’s personal bodyguard. The King needed to be under their protection, you see, to keep him safe from reactionary aristocrats who might whisper evil things in his ear. Lafayette made a brief attempt to talk them out of all this, but he was abruptly confronted with the reality of the situation. He was told, you don’t seem to understand, we’re going to Versailles, you can either lead us there or we’ll just march right over you.

[(18:25)](#!):

There was in this an implicit threat that they were ready to string up Lafayette himself if he tried to get in their way. So deciding that leading an organized march rather than dying and letting the National Guard go off as a headless but very well armed mob, Lafayette agreed to lead them. So off they went, just as some pretty heavy rain set in. Lafayette did, however, manage to send a rider off to warn both the King and the National Assembly that about 15,000 troops were now headed their way, loyalties TBD.

[(18:60)](#!):

It was four o’clock in the afternoon by the time Lafayette got his men moving. By then, the ladies had already reached the gates of Versailles. There they were greeted coolly, but not with any overt hostility, though they were told in no uncertain terms that they weren’t getting into the palace ground, so just forget about that. So for the moment, the women did. They decided instead to go after the less well defended and hopefully more open to reason National Assembly, which was winding down its business for the day. The women first sent in one of the men who had come along to make a formal statement of their demands, but then they just bagged whatever stiff protocol they were trying to observe, and by the hundreds, they started streaming into the hall where the Assembly met, sitting in empty seats, confronting the delegates, and just kind of generally making themselves at home.

[(19:48)](#!):

These Paris housewives are not the classiest bunch of ladies, and they made quite a little spectacle of themselves up to and including heaping abuse on any clergyman they spotted. I think they called the Archbishop of Paris a dog right through his face.

[(20:02)](#!):

Meunier, recently elected President of the Assembly, took the floor and did his best to say whatever it was going to take to get the women out of the hall. And at the very least, his speech did eat up enough time for the ladies to decide it was time to go do what they had really come to do, which was go confront the king and queen and make them pay, do something, not do something. They weren’t too clear about that anymore. So out they went, to some very audible sighs of relief from the flustered delegates of the National Assembly.

[(20:34)](#!):

Okay, so by now it’s getting past five o’clock. The king, who had been off on his daily hunt, rushed back to the palace when he was told that something like 10,000 armed women were at the gate sire, what should we do? And when he got back, he agreed to meet with a small delegation from the crowd. When the delegation arrived, he told them what was very likely the truth, that he knew they were suffering, he hated that they were suffering, and had already ordered all available grain to be gathered up and carted down to Paris to relieve the situation. This was all already in motion. So hopefully relief is on the way, but there’s not really a whole lot I can do right at this very second.

[(21:12)](#!):

When the delegation returned to their comrades with the king’s response, a few of the more vocal agitators dismissed it as so many lies, but for the rest, the news that the king did seem to be doing everything he could did help dampen their wrath a bit. And that’s about when the rider showed up telling everyone that the National Guard was on the way, and who knows which side they are going to be on.

[(21:33)](#!):

So Louis scrambled to keep the situation from getting out of hand, and he quickly let it be known that on second thought, he had decided to sign the August 11 decree, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man after all. See, I mean, yeah, I had my reservations about it, but I don’t know where you got this crazy idea that I wasn’t going to sign it at all. I mean, come on, give it to me, I’ll sign it. Just let’s not massacre me and my family, please.

[(21:57)](#!):

It wasn’t until just about midnight, though, that the National Guard finally showed up. And by that point, it had gone through the ranks that not only were they going to become the king’s bodyguard, but that they were going to have to escort both the king and his family back to Paris. It simply wasn’t safe, or in keeping with the spirit of the times, for them to remain at Versailles anymore.

[(22:18)](#!):

When they arrived at the scene, their nominal leader, Lafayette, beat a quick path over to the National Assembly, who were obviously still in emergency session, and told them, look, as much as I hate to admit it, my own men have basically come here on their own accord, and I couldn’t stop them. Then he said that there was a very quick way to defuse the situation. The Flanders regiment needed to be sent back to the frontier. The king needed to make some kind of positive gesture towards the besmirched cockade, and then the king needed to relocate to Paris.

[(22:48)](#!):

This little list was then transmitted to the king, along with a request for a one-on-one meeting with Lafayette, so Lafayette could tell the king directly just what the score was. The meeting was granted, as long as Lafayette came alone and unarmed, and over the objection of his men, Lafayette agreed.

[(23:05)](#!):

At the meeting, the king said, okay, look, I’ll dismiss the Flanders regiment, though for the record, all that stuff in the paper is made up, I’ll kiss the cockade, or hug the cockade, or whatever you want me to do, but I’m going to have to think about relocating to Paris. That’s a big request, and it will impact a lot of people, so you know, just let me think it over. So Lafayette returned to his men, and they all then sat around, awaiting the king’s decision. Lafayette himself stayed up until dawn, but as the sun broke, he started to nod off, just in time for the lid to blow off the whole thing.

[(23:42)](#!):

At about 5.30 in the morning, someone, probably a sympathetic guard inside the palace, opened up the gates to the inner courtyard, and the camped women, who had just been sitting around all night in some pretty crappy weather, went rushing in, and they were in a foul mood. They then pushed their way right into the royal apartments. They were screaming and yelling, and looking for all the world like they were quite literally out for blood, with the queen number one on their hit list. As the mob came storming in, the palace guards did their thing. They tried to force them back, and there was sporadic gunfire, and a few on both sides soon lay dead.

[(24:18)](#!):

But the alarm was raised quick enough for Marie Antoinette to slip out of her own room through a side door that took her directly over to the king’s room, and I’ve got a picture of that little door posted at RevolutionsPodcast.com that I took while we were in the royal apartments at Versailles on the last Revolutions tour. But of course, after Marie Antoinette hustled down the hall, she found the king’s door was locked, because Louis himself was off trying to locate their children and stick them someplace safe. So the queen pounded on this locked door for 10 or 15 minutes, trapped inside a narrow passageway with a bloodthirsty mob literally breaking in the doors and calling for her head. So this is not really the greatest 10 to 15 minutes of Marie Antoinette’s life. But before the mob got her, the door to the king’s room finally opened, and the royal family all hunkered down together.

[(25:09)](#!):

They were rescued, at least for the moment, by a contingent of national guardsmen led by a young officer named Lazar Hoche, who will in time become one of the most successful of the revolutionary generals, but that’s all for later. For now, Hoche and his men secured the royal family, and the women protesters were steadily but firmly pushed back out into the grounds, though by now they had cut off the heads of two dead bodyguards and were parading them around in triumph, so it’s not like all order had been restored.

[(25:40)](#!):

Lafayette by this point had managed to push his own way into the palace and made his way to the room where the royal family was being held, quite likely fearing the worst. But when he got there, he found the king chatting calmly with the guardsmen, who had apparently told the king that they wanted now to be his bodyguard, and they had gone ahead and sworn a loyalty oath to him right then and there on the spot. Okay, so that’s good. So Lafayette got together with the king and said, look sire, here’s what you’re going to have to do. You have to go out on your balcony and present yourself to everyone assembled outside. We’ll think of something to rehabilitate the cockade, and then you’re going to have to announce your willingness to relocate to Paris.

[(26:21)](#!):

This being no time to argue, the king agreed. He and Lafayette went out on the balcony, where the king was greeted by great cheering even more so when he announced that yes indeed, he and his family would be relocating to Paris to be closer to their people. Then Lafayette brought out a non-commissioned officer from the Flanders regiment and pinned a tri-color cockade on his jacket. The crowd went nuts. Finally, at Lafayette’s insistence, Marie Antoinette was brought out onto the balcony too. Now, a lot of those women out there had been calling for her head just a few minutes earlier, so the queen was understandably hesitant. But in the moment, the crowd did not bury her in catcalls and heckling insults. Instead, there was vaguely positive murmuring, and even a few long-lived queens.

[(27:08)](#!):

So it was settled. The royal family now belonged to the people. Shortly thereafter, the king and queen hastily packed up, as did their ministers and courtiers and servants. Then everyone\xe2\x80\x94the protesting housewives, the National Guard, the entire royal retinue, something like 60,000 people in Lafayette’s estimation\xe2\x80\x94slowly started out on the road back to Paris. Upon hearing that the king was leaving, the National Assembly immediately declared that they were inseparable from him and voted to relocate to Paris as well. Once everyone was gone, the palace at Versailles was locked up and guarded by a few soldiers who would prevent locals from trashing the place while the royal family was away.

[(27:51)](#!):

But as it turned out, the royal family would never be coming back. When the king and queen and their children left Versailles on October 6, 1789, the great Palace of the Sun King was done forever as the center of the French kingdom. It was the most visible and opulent symbol of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, and it was now permanently abandoned. The march of the Paris housewives shuttered it for good.

[(28:19)](#!):

With the benefit of hindsight, we also now know that those Paris housewives also brought to a close what I’ll call the first phase of the French Revolution, which had begun with the calling of the Estates General, and then produced the National Assembly, the Tennis Court Oath, the Fault of the Bastille, the Night of August the Fourth, and then the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It had, in many ways, been a revolution of the bourgeoisie, as men of that general rank, demeanor, and education found themselves elevated into positions of major authority, not just in the national government, but also the government of Paris and municipalities across France.

[(28:57)](#!):

These guys stood for the principles of 1789, enlightenment philosophy and science, free trade, national sovereignty, constitutional government. But with the women’s march on Versailles, and the carrying away of the king back to Paris, a new phase of the revolution is about to begin, one that would be marked by everyone trying to make the new constitutional system work, and quickly finding that no one was committed to making it work. The conservatives would constantly try to undermine it, and more radical elements would constantly try to extend it even further.

[(29:32)](#!):

So though there would be a great party on July the 14th, 1790, to celebrate the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille and revel in the brotherhood of man that had been born of it, it turned out that just under the surface, everyone was ready to tear everyone else limb from limb.

Before we go today, I should probably mention that I was just recently a guest on Cameron Reilly and Ray Harris’s new Life of Caesar podcast, which was a great deal of fun. We spent almost an hour and a half loosely talking around the life and times of my old friend Julius Caesar. There is other stuff that’s mixed in there too, and apparently nothing got edited out. So if you want a little freewheeling conversational history, go to the Life of Caesar podcast and find the episode starring me, Mike Duncan, because Cameron assures me that the other episodes are complete rot. So don’t even bother.

I’m kidding. It’s a good show. Check out Life of Caesar. I’ll see you in the next video.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.15, The Birth of the Jacobins.

[(01:25)](#!):

The women’s march on Versailles fundamentally changed the course of the French Revolution. By dragging the king back to Paris, the political dynamic is about to shift dramatically. For one thing, no one was quite sure whether the king was there of his own free will or whether he was actually some kind of hostage. Was he a citizen king living closer to his people or a divine monarch being held hostage by a blasphemous rabble? Everyone mostly tried to agree it was the former, but more than a few, including probably the king himself, knew that it was the latter. In time, this question of just how much free will the king had left would become a major point of contention, but for now, everyone attempted to entertain the fiction that they were all on the same page.

[(02:12)](#!):

But aside from the question of the king, the move to Paris also dramatically rearranged political alliances within the National Assembly. The very act of moving to Paris helped polarize the assembly even more than it had been, and led directly to the rise of organized political clubs who would wage the next series of battles over the meaning and direction of the revolution. And of course, that it was all now unfolding under the watchful eye of the radical Parisians? Well, that would be a thing too.

[(02:42)](#!):

Over the winter of 1789-1790, there were two big issues on the table that helped fuel the new political polarization. What did it mean to be a citizen, and what are we going to do about the Catholic Church? Both questions had huge implications for the future of France, and both questions helped split the delegates and their supporters into warring camps.

[(03:06)](#!):

Now, the last thing I’ll say before we get going today is that though these two issues were the main points of contention, the National Assembly dealt with a whole host of issues during the months after the move to Paris, and I’ll sort of be plucking them out as needed in the episodes to come. So like, in March 1790, the National Assembly is going to fundamentally reorganize the administrative map of France, and though we will definitely talk about it, we’re not going to talk about it today. So just to set the stage here a bit, remember that the king was hauled off to Paris on October 6th, 1789. But it wasn’t actually until October 9th that the National Assembly voted to follow him to the capital. In the interim, they still had some business to attend to, including finally responding to a plea made by Jacques Necker the week before.

[(03:56)](#!):

At the end of September, Necker had come down to the Assembly to remind the delegates that the country was still massively in debt and still running unsustainable deficits. Remember? That’s why you were all called in the first place? Some of the debt pressure had come off simply by virtue of the National Assembly’s very existence. Creditors liked the revenue possibilities of a government with a representative body a whole lot more than they liked one built on the failing despotism of the late Bourbon dynasty.

[(04:25)](#!):

But the estates had been called back in May, and it was now October, and very little had been done on the financial front. So Necker proposed to close the gap with a one-time patriotic contribution that would amount to 25% of a citizen’s annual income. This obviously caused a huge uproar, and charges that Necker was now trying to fleece the people to pay off his banker friends. But with no other clear solution to the problem, the National Assembly voted on October 6th \xe2\x80\x93 that is, probably just a few hours after the king and 60,000 of his closest friends had left for Paris \xe2\x80\x93 to approve the patriotic contribution. But then they voted no mechanism for assessment or collection, and the patriotic contribution never really went anywhere.

[(05:09)](#!):

After this stark reminder about the financial health of the kingdom, though, some delegates started discussing an alternative to the patriotic contribution that would rest on the massive amounts of property owned by the Catholic Church. Ever since the night of August the 4th, the status of the French Catholic Church had been up in the air. Tithes had been abolished, they didn’t look like they were coming back, so how were we going to pay the parish priests? And was it really fair for the Church to control so much property independently of the nation \xe2\x80\x93 especially as the nation continues to face a financial crisis?

[(05:44)](#!):

To answer both these questions simultaneously, the Bishop of Outain, my good friend Talleyrand, took to the floor on October 10th, and proposed that some church property should be nationalized, and that clergymen should become salaried employees of the state.

[(05:60)](#!):

Talleyrand reckoned that two-thirds of what the church owned could easily cover the expenses for all the church functionaries, while the other third could be used to shore up the nation’s finances. Basically, Talleyrand was proposing to make the church a public institution and turn priests into bureaucrats running the Department of Morality. This obviously caused quite an uproar itself, and no less because it came straight from a bishop, although Talleyrand never was much of a bishop. He was just a rational, unsentimental statesman who believed that nationalizing the church would help make France stronger.

[(06:36)](#!):

But the pushback to this was stiff and immediate, led obviously by the clergy themselves. They had just seen their tithes stripped away without a second thought, and now the National Assembly planned to confiscate all their property to boot? They didn’t care that Talleyrand promised that their state salaries would be more lucrative than the old tithes. This was a matter of religious principle, and also, frankly, civil principle. The abbey CS, himself a clergyman, and strongly radical in most things, stood up and said this absolutely violates the sacredness of property enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

[(07:13)](#!):

So with this fairly massive proposal on the table, the delegates then put a hold on all business to make preparations for the move to Paris. And as I just said, the very fact of this move helped shift the dynamics of the debate.

[(07:27)](#!):

When the delegates had arrived in Versailles back in April and May, they had often settled into group lodgings to cut down on costs, and delegates inevitably lodged with their provincial colleagues. But the last few months of political drama had rendered those old provincial attachments obsolete. So when the delegates began to hunt for lodgings in Paris, they again sought out group accommodations, but this time they tended to go out looking with men who shared their ideological point of view and voting habits. So the radicals got together, and they tended to live together in the city center close to the action, while the conservatives tend to come together to take up lodgings on the outskirts of the city, where they would be less likely to be, you know, lynched.

[(08:10)](#!):

So obviously, if you’re living and working exclusively with people who agree with you, well, that creates polarization.

[(08:18)](#!):

Also nudging this polarization along was the structure of their new meeting hall. By early November, the assembly would settle into the menage, that is, the horse training grounds of the Tuileries Palace. This was a big rectangular room, with the delegates sitting in risers built along the two long sides. So naturally, delegates who were friends and allies tended to sit together. And almost immediately, the conservatives took over the right side of the hall, while the radicals took over the left. Which is, no joke, where the right-left political labels that we still use today come from. So that’s pretty cool.

[(08:58)](#!):

In this new world, the delegates were going to retake up the question of the church. But before they got to that, they wound up embroiled in another debate that would both shape and be shaped by the new political environment. And that was the question of citizenship. Now I already talked about this back when we went through the Declaration of the Rights of Man. But it was just now, right after the move to Paris, that the distinction between active and passive citizens was invented. The radicals were of course opposed to the whole distinction, and wanted a much more open and democratic definition of citizenship.

[(09:33)](#!):

But the conservatives, and other sensible men in the middle, were like, no, we’re not going to give some foul-mouthed day-worker a say in government. So at the end of October, the fairly restrictive definition of a 25-year-old man who pays the equivalent of three days’ wages in taxes, that is, guys who own some property, would be an active citizen. Everyone else would be merely passive. This set the radical delegates to further despondent soul-searching. But it also set to work agitators who claimed to speak for the now-disenfranchised masses.

[(10:08)](#!):

In the hyper-radical Paris section, called the courtelier, self-declared spokesmen like Jean-Paul Marat, Camille Demoulas, remember he was the guy who gave the fiery speech on the day the Bastille fell, and then Georges Danton, who we haven’t even gotten to yet, but who was about to become a revolutionary giant. These guys will take the passive citizen slap in the face and start building a political force to oppose the queue-lot-wearing dandies running the National Assembly. And when those guys start getting into the mix, boy, this thing is going to get crazy.

[(10:42)](#!):

So though the radical assembly delegates had just lost another vote, the Munarussian coalition that had risen up in the summer of 1789 was already starting to splinter in the aftermath of the October days. Not for the least reason that the central pillar of the coalition, Jean-Joseph Meunier, did not make the move to Paris. Deeply put out by the events of October 5th and 6th, Meunier decided he could no longer serve a government that could be so nakedly coerced by mob violence. Before the assembly moved to Paris, he withdrew from the assembly and headed back home to Dauphin\xc3\xa9. Meunier had been one of the principal leaders of the Third Estate for well over a year now, and had been way out in front on doubling the third and voting by head. But in his estimation, things were now out of control, and going too far. So he quit the very institution he had done so much to bring about. Shortly, he will come under attack from his former friends in Dauphin\xc3\xa9 as a reactionary counter-revolutionary, and will be driven into exile, because that’s how it goes in the French Revolution.

[(11:47)](#!):

So the debate over citizenship, then, was something of a high watermark for the Conservatives. As the next order of business showed their influence clearly on the wane. On November 3rd, the Comte de Mirabeau came forward with a rewording of Talleyrand’s motion to nationalize church lands. Rather than out-and-out nationalization, church property would simply be put at the disposal of the nation, still administered by the clergy, but on the understanding that they were acting as stewards of the nation’s wealth. To the shock and horror of most church delegates, this motion passed, and whatever the fancy wording was, it looked a hell of a lot like the National Assembly had just claimed ownership over the church’s property.

[(12:28)](#!):

Then about a month later, the National Assembly put its money, or rather the church’s money, where its mouth was, and they voted to sell off 400 million livres in unspecified church property to improve the nation’s financial outlook. On December 19th, the first batch went up for sale, and the proceeds would then be used to back a new kind of bond bearing 5% interest, called the assigneur. The assigneur would be distributed in 200 or 400 livres notes, and be used to pay the kingdom’s creditors, and then the creditors could turn around and use them to acquire national property. The church, obviously, was utterly incensed, and it appears that priests across the kingdom took to the pulpit to denounce this theft of church lands, and basically promised eternal damnation for anyone who even thought about buying a piece for themselves.

[(13:17)](#!):

Having lost the vote on citizenship, but then winning the vote on church property, the radicals sensed an opportunity to reclaim the initiative, and so they spent the winter of 1789-1790 getting ready for battle. After moving to Paris, the old members of the Breton Club gathered together to form a new club, a club that would be far more organized, disciplined, and centralized than the freewheeling Breton Club meetings had been. Something that would allow them to combat the organized voting that was already in force over on the right side of the hall.

[(13:50)](#!):

So in late November, or early December, these guys leased space from the Dominican convent of Saint-Jacques. Officially, their new club was called the Society of Friends of the Constitution, but everyone else just started calling them the Jacobins, and by January 1790, the unofficial title was adopted in practice by the members themselves.

[(14:13)](#!):

Though the Jacobins would go through a couple of intense periods of radicalization, initially they invited in everyone who could support three basic principles. One, you must be dedicated to upholding constitutional government. Two, you must support political equality for all, that is, be opposed to the active-passive citizen dichotomy. And third, you must be ready to combat counter-revolutionary plots. As long as you were down with that, then come on in.

[(14:43)](#!):

When new members joined, what they found was a national assembly in miniature. Meetings were generally held three times a week, mostly to rehash assembly business, respond to past events, and then draw up future plans. Rules for speaking and debate followed those of the national assembly, and everything was open to the public. The debates at the Jacobin Club soon became a staple form of public entertainment. But to keep everything on track, the Jacobins also had a central steering committee, modeled quite explicitly on the committee Mounier had developed. This committee would guide policy decisions, and then hand out marching orders after all the debating was done.

[(15:23)](#!):

Then the Jacobins developed one further institutional branch that helped their rapid ascendancy to shadow revolutionary government. They established a committee of correspondents to open the lines of communication to like-minded men out in the provinces. By actively pursuing political organization outside the capital, the Jacobins would soon be able to make a convincing claim to be more representative of the nation than the national government itself. At its height, there were 7,000 Jacobin Clubs across France, boasting almost 500,000 active members. No other political faction could even come close to putting together that strong of a party. Because the Jacobins are about to start driving events, it should come as no surprise that most of the major revolutionary figures will count themselves as members of the Jacobins at some point or another.

[(16:15)](#!):

We’ll get to them all in turn, but there’s one guy that we should peel off and talk about right now. I was thinking that I would wait to introduce him, but since he and the Jacobins are so inextricably linked, we might as well just cover it now. And I’m talking, of course, about Maximilien Robespierre. Maximilien Robespierre was born in 1758 in Arras, a city in North France, near the border with the Austrian Netherlands, that is, Belgium. Both his grandfather and father had been lawyers in Arras, but after Robespierre’s mother died, his father went out on some kind of world tour and only rarely came home, so Robespierre himself was raised mostly by his grandparents.

[(16:59)](#!):

He was a bright kid, and after catching the attention of the bishop of Arras, he received a scholarship to attend the Lycee Louis-Lagrand, where, as I already noted, he was a classmate of Camille de Moulin. But the two did not really travel in the same social circle. And in truth, it seemed like Robespierre didn’t really travel in any social circle at all. He earned a reputation as a hyper-serious student with a passion for classical Roman virtue and Enlightenment philosophy.

[(17:27)](#!):

He graduated the Lycee in 1781 and returned to Arras to take up a career as a provincial lawyer. Over the next few years, he made a local name for himself, often representing poor plaintiffs just because of the principles at stake. He also earned himself an election to the local academy, one of those prestigious intellectual clubs that dotted the landscape of Enlightenment-era France. So still only in his late 20s, Robespierre was now well established, he had written a few prize-winning essays, and was basically on his way to becoming a pillar of the local community. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less.

[(18:04)](#!):

But when the pre-revolution came, and the convening of the Estates General seemed more and more inevitable, Robespierre wanted in. Like everyone else, he wrote an essay calling for new electoral procedures, the doubling of the Third’s representatives, and then voting by head. When the Estates General did get called, he stood for election and barely squeaked his way in, more prominent and more conservative men grabbing up most of the vote. But once he arrived in Versailles, Robespierre immediately found himself becoming a leader of the radicals and a frequent speaker.

[(18:38)](#!):

Carrying around in his head a mix of Rousseau and Montesquieu and classical philosophy, Robespierre stressed the goodness of the average Frenchman, and called for an end to any institution that tended to threaten that fundamental virtue. He was opposed to the division between active and passive citizens, believing that the more representative the government, the better it must be.

[(19:00)](#!):

All of this meant that Robespierre had been one of those delegates put out by the conservative tilt of the National Assembly. So after they all moved to Paris, Robespierre was right in the middle of the reorganization of the left. He helped found the Jacobin Club, and then sat on the Executive Steering Committee, along with the Triumvirate of Dupour, Barnab\xc3\xa9, and Lema\xc3\xaetre, and the great orator Mirabeau. The others would soon become alienated from the very club they had just founded, but Robespierre? Robespierre’s power and influence are only going to grow. So welcome to the stage, Maximilien Robespierre.

[(19:41)](#!):

Now though the left was really starting to get their act together, they were not the only ones reorganizing after the National Assembly moved to Paris. On the conservative right, a similar process was underway, though not on the scale or with the success of the Jacobins.

[(19:58)](#!):

The first thing to note is that as a result of this reorganization, the right will become even more conservative than it had been before. If you’ll recall, when Meunier had organized the Munartian coalition, the moderate conservatives were the drivers, and the arch-conservative aristocrats were basically the junior partners, supporting Meunier on a lesser-of-two-evils basis. But after the jump to Paris and the resignation of Meunier, these roles reversed. Meunier’s old allies tried to organize a new coalition of sensible, moderate men called the Impartials, but they had trouble recruiting. Their basic position was that the revolution as such was now over. The country needed a strong king and a strong Catholic Church to consolidate what had just happened. This earned them obviously no love from the left, but it also got them very little love from the far right, who wanted to undo, not consolidate, everything that had just happened.

[(20:56)](#!):

The only place the Impartials could look to for allies were the group of liberal nobles surrounding Lafayette, but Lafayette and his crew were enlightened on the matter of religion and could not support the kind of super-pro Catholicism espoused by the Impartials. So though the Impartials went through the motions of setting up an independent political club and publishing newspapers, they never had more than about 70 members, and of those, only about 20 were really into it. The vacuum left by the receding power of the center-right was thus filled by a far more conservative group, who was shadowy then, and remains shadowy now.

[(21:34)](#!):

Dubbed the Augustinians, because they initially held their meetings in a convent of the Grands Augustin, this far-right group had a core of about 200 members, the old disaffected nobles who never wanted to break up the three estates in the first place, joined now by clergymen shocked by the anti-clerical turns the National Assembly had been taking of late. Unfortunately for future historians, the Augustinians weren’t interested in printing manifestos or publishing minutes of their meetings, preferring instead the kind of secrecy that only bred paranoid fears about counter-revolutionary plots, or frankly, not-so-paranoid fears about counter-revolutionary plots.

[(22:14)](#!):

But we do have references to a small group of commissioners who steered the club’s business and plotted parliamentary strategy. We also know that the club meeting house in central Paris was soon the object of scorn for local Parisians in the neighborhood who didn’t like these aristocrats plotting the downfall of the revolution in their own backyard. So though the Augustinians retained their name, they were forced to move, and then move a few more times, before simply using members’ own homes for their meetings.

[(22:44)](#!):

One of the reasons I say that some fears about counter-revolutionary plots were not paranoid was that just before Christmas, the Marquis de Fravra, a retired army colonel, was accused of some fantastic treachery. The Paris press uncovered a plot allegedly masterminded by the Comp de Provence to rescue the royal family and rush them out of the country to safety. Lafayette, Bailly, and Jacques Necker were all allegedly slated for assassination, and then Paris would be surrounded by troops loyal to the Comp de Provence.

[(23:18)](#!):

The Marquis de Fravra was accused of being the point man for this insidious operation, and so the Marquis de Favra was arrested on December 24, 1789, whereupon the Comp de Provence came down to the Paris Commune to assure them that he knew nothing about nothing. Favra was then put on a lengthy trial lasting almost two months where scanty evidence and refusal of witnesses to testify led to major doubts about his guilt. But in late January, an attempt to spring him from jail was foiled by Lafayette, and doubts about Fravra’s guilt disappeared.

[(23:55)](#!):

On February 18, he was sentenced to hang, and the next day he went to the gallows, which the Parisians simply loved because no special privileges about the mode or place of execution was extended to the condemned Marquis. He would hang in public like a commoner. And so, on February 19, that’s exactly what happened. Fears about these kinds of plots, many of which were real, but many more of which were figments of the imagination, are about to play a major part in turning the revolutionaries down the bloody road to the Reign of Terror.

[(24:32)](#!):

Just as the trial of Fravra was reaching its conclusion, the National Assembly continued on with its business. On February the 4th, they welcomed into the hall their citizen King Louis, who came dressed in plain black clothes. He promised to uphold the Constitution, and was greeted by rapturous applause. Then the delegates took another bold step against the Catholic Church. Led by the Jacobin delegates, now ready to start flexing their political muscle, the Assembly voted on February the 13th to simply stop recognizing monastic vows. So every monk and nun in France was no longer under any obligation to remain at their posts.

[(25:12)](#!):

The hope was that this vote would both free those who would become virtual prisoners of the convents, and then also it would clear out the freeloaders who were happy to remain lazy parasites freed off the nation. It went without saying that the property of the religious orders would become a major part of that 400 million livre the National Assembly had already laid claim to, and this was a factor in helping moderates justify their vote to suppress their religious orders. Real church land wouldn’t be auctioned off, just those of the parasitic monasteries.

[(25:47)](#!):

But then on March the 6th, Jacques Neckerre came down with yet another bleak financial report which forced everyone to start making hard choices. Do we really start auctioning off all church property, or do we back off these sacrilegious plans and find a different way out of the financial hole? On April the 9th, the debate began in earnest when two Assembly subcommittees both published reports calling for a decision on just how much church property was available for the nation to use. The key question now was, were they going to keep futzing around with semantics, or was the church going to be nationalized?

[(26:23)](#!):

A corollary to this was how to start treating the asignat, which had already been issued and were now being informally treated as a form of currency. Should their status as currency be officially recognized? And if so, then we’d better make sure they’re backed by something substantial. The Jacobin delegates argued then for full nationalization, but for more reasons than just economics. Yes, there was a financial crisis, but even more than that, the first estate needs to be demolished if the nation is going to come together as one. Allowing them to run their own little private empire over there is just not going to work anymore. Others chimed in to say that nationalization might actually be beneficial to the church, because it would presumably shed fatal light on corrupt aristocrats stealing from the church’s coffers. And then others said that this was actually a really good way to secure the future of the revolution because anyone who buys church lands will have a vested interest in the revolution’s success. On the other side, the Augustinian conservatives came back and said this is crazy. Property is sacred, especially church property. Plus, if you just flood the market with the auction property, it isn’t going to be worth nearly what we’re going to be giving up. More than a few hinting that what they would be giving up was their very souls.

[(27:41)](#!):

Now I think the arch-conservative Augustinians were more often than not simply using the language of piety to splinter the national assembly, which they wanted to see destroyed anyway. But the majority of the clerical delegates and more than a few uncommitted delegates were truly concerned about the fate of the church and all of their souls. One such conflicted delegate then stepped forward with what he hoped was a proposal to bridge the divide. A member of the Jacobin Club, but also a devout Catholic, this guy proposed that the assembly immediately declare the Catholic Church the official state religion.

[(28:17)](#!):

This sent the debate spinning in a whole new direction, with attacks levied on both sides that had really never been so bitter. The left accused the right of helping hypocrites in the church bankrupt the nation, while the right accused the left of greedy sacrilege. After the Jacobins engineered an adjournment for the day, they reconvened and plotted strategy, and came up with the following plan. The next day they would bring out a motion that so majestic a thing as religious belief could not be legislated by the national assembly, but that clearly the Catholic Church would be favored in the new constitutional order. This appeased just enough uncommitted members to get the motion passed by a slight majority the next day. In response, the conservative delegates started resigning and boycotting the national assembly in protest. On April the 19th, 292 signed a petition against what the national assembly had just done, sending copies across France to stir up resentment. Anti-clericalism played well on the streets of Paris, but not out in the rural provinces, as we will see in a major way once the revolution really gets radicalized a few more episodes down the road.

[(29:29)](#!):

But with all the conservatives now out of the room, the left simply passed the decree as nationalizing church lands and recognizing the asignat as a form of currency by huge majorities. Then they started opening up letters coming in from the provinces supporting what they had just done. These letters took everyone by surprise, and would egg the delegates onto further attempts to force the church into a subservient position in the new constitutional order. But these letters were likely the work of the Jacobins Correspondence Committee was of course neither here nor there, nor did it give anyone a false impression about what the people of France did and did not want.

[(30:08)](#!):

So the suppression of the religious orders, coupled with the abolition of tithes, the nationalization of church lands, this can all be taken as a modern spin on the old medieval tug of war between the church and the king, but it was now being recast as a tug of war between the church and the nation. Who ultimately served who? Next week, the nation will make its most audacious play for supremacy in this new modern tug of war, and it will be a play that will backfire mightily.

[(30:40)](#!):

Just as everyone was getting ready to celebrate the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille and the unity of the French nation, the National Assembly would unveil the civil constitution of the clergy, which as much as anything helped destroy the unity of the French nation.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions, Episode 3.16, The Society of 1789.

[(01:53)](#!):

So we left off last time with the National Constituent Assembly moving forward with its plans to nationalize the French Catholic Church. Today, that process will take another huge step forward. But the Church was not the only thing on the table in the spring and early summer of 1790. The delegates of the assembly worked extraordinarily long hours, seven days a week, to try to work out a new constitution for France. But every issue they took up seemed tangled up with every other issue. And then as they tried to untangle the knot, they were forced to take up issues they had not meant to take up at all. But that’s how it goes when you try to rewrite the fundamental laws of an ancient kingdom from scratch.

[(02:34)](#!):

Today, we will see them dive into questions about the judicial system, the making of war and peace, the future of hereditary rights, and then of course once again back to the Church. During the course of these debates, we will also see the center of political gravity shift again. This time in the direction of the Marquis de Lafayette and his liberal, noble friends. Now as we discussed last week, the Conservatives were already in decline. The move to Paris had simultaneously weakened the right wing of the National Assembly while immeasurably strengthening the left.

[(03:08)](#!):

But the left was such a broad coalition that it started to fracture the moment it triumphed. A key turning point in both the fading of the right and the splintering of the left was the King’s speech to the National Assembly in early February. I mentioned it very briefly last week, but just to rehash it, the King came down on February the 4th, dressed in plain clothes without retinue or ceremony, and pledged to uphold the Constitution, whatever it turned out to be. If we trace the loop-de-loops of the King’s endless political vacillation, this is one of those moments where he seems to be genuinely accepting what has happened and reconciling himself to the new order. He could be a citizen king. He would be a citizen king. Thus, the Conservative position was deeply undercut by the King’s new patriotic attitude. If the monarchy was prepared to accept Constitutional government, the lynchpin of any Conservative reaction was gone. Conservative morale went into the toilet.

[(04:06)](#!):

But the King’s reconciliation also splintered the left for two basic reasons. At first, many of the delegates on the left had been held together by the mutual fear of a counter-revolutionary attack. With the King saying, I’m ready to accept the new order, well, that pretty much eliminated the possibility of counter-revolutionary attack. I mean, there might be some dead-ender marquee out there still fantasizing about going back to the good old days, but the King has given up on that fantasy for himself. So where does that leave our dead-ender marquee? With no leg to stand on, that’s where.

[(04:40)](#!):

But the other reason the left splintered was that a bunch of the moderate delegates on the left had always wanted to work with the King. They’d been dying to work with the King. But his waffling intransigence had made it almost impossible. So with the King now reaching out his hand, they absolutely wanted to take it. Meanwhile, the radical delegates still didn’t trust the King. They didn’t want to work with Louis. They wanted to tell Louis what to do. So just as the newly founded Jacobin Club was coming into its own, it fractured. And for the rest of 1790, it looked to many like the Jacobins were not the future of the revolution, but rather a collection of men as dead-ended as our fantasizing marquee.

[(05:21)](#!):

So if the far right and the far left were boxed out by the King’s new attitude, who was left in the box? Well, I’ll tell you, the liberal nobles who formed a new political club called the Society of 1789.

[(05:37)](#!):

As a colonel, the Society of 1789 came to life shortly after the move to Paris when a few liberal nobles began to meet up informally. Most had joined the new Jacobin Club, and initially the Society of 1789 was more social than political. Prominent at these early gatherings were the Abb\xc3\xa9cs and Condorcet, and a few other like minded fellows, most of whom had been members of Adrien Dupour’s loosely organized Society of 30, back during the lead up to the Estates General. Though interestingly enough, Adrien Dupour himself, the man who had been at the center of the Society of 30, did not join the Society of 1789.

[(06:16)](#!):

After the King’s speech in February seemed to remove the threat of counter-revolution, the liberal nobles started to see in the radical Jacobins the next threat to the new enlightened order. The first big split came in March, over the issue of who could be a member of the Jacobin Club. The Central Committee, run by Robespierre, Dupour, Barnab\xc3\xa9, and Lema\xc3\xaetre, were happy to open membership to anyone who could pay the dues. But the liberal nobles thought that it ought to be restricted to men who were delegates of the National Assembly. After all, if the club planned to hand down instructions to its delegate members on how to vote, inviting in just anyone off the street to have their say, that made no sense.

[(06:56)](#!):

With the open membership policy adopted, though, the Comp de Crillon and a group of associates walked out in March 1790 to set up their own little club. Then just a few weeks later, Lafayette himself stopped attending Jacobin Club meetings for the same basic reasons, though his withdrawal was also driven by a running feud with Alexandre Lema\xc3\xaetre. Though they had fought together during the American Revolution, Lema\xc3\xaetre never liked or trusted Lafayette, who he found exhaustingly vainglorious. Lafayette, meanwhile, suspected with good reason that Lema\xc3\xaetre was aiming to supplant Lafayette as the head of the National Guard.

[(07:32)](#!):

By April, the Society of 1789 had solidified into an organized political club with dues and rules of order and a basic agenda. And from their name, it’s not hard to guess what their agenda was. Ensure the survival of a constitutional monarchy built on principles outlined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

[(07:52)](#!):

As I said, these guys were mostly liberal nobles, and soon joining their ranks were Mirabeau, Talleyrand, Bailly, and making his very first peek into the history books, a writer and man of business for the Duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, Jacques-Pierre Brissot, who would, a few more factional splinterings down the road, find himself at the center of the Girondins. So that will make him kind of a big deal.

[(08:17)](#!):

For the moment, most of the members of the Society of 1789 continued to hold dual membership in the Jacobin Club, but it wouldn’t be long before they were forced to pick a side. With tensions on the left rising, the National Assembly took up two matters in May 1790, which ruptured the binds that so tenuously held them together. First, the matter of judicial reform, and second, the matter of who would be allowed to declare war in the new constitutional order. One of those things the National Assembly had done over the winter of 1789-1790 that I said I would go back and pluck out as needed- was to suspend the functions of the Parliament.

[(09:01)](#!):

With everything that had gone on over the last year, having some little backwater of hereditary privilege running the judicial system was unacceptable. The rule of law was of paramount importance, so having these judges who bought or inherited their offices rather than earning them by merit just wasn’t going to fly. In early November 1789, the Parliament were suspended, and as I said a while back, no one came to their defense this time around. But that left the very obvious question, well what do we replace it with?

[(09:35)](#!):

In May 1790, the National Assembly finally took up the question. From his central position within the Jacobin Club and the National Assembly, Adrian Dupour, along at the forefront of battles over the judiciary, obviously took the lead. He drew up a plan that called for the democratization of the legal system. He wanted judges to be elected, juries to hear civil cases, and all laws applicable to everyone regardless of wealth or social status.

[(10:02)](#!):

But when this program was taken to the National Assembly, the delegates balked at its sweepingly democratic nature. Even Jacobin delegates shrugged off party discipline to vote against the package. From the critical question of whether the king would have a veto over judicial appointments, the Jacobin left just barely held it together enough to squeak through a narrow no vote. It was obvious where the Jacobin defections were coming from. It was the liberal nobles of that society of 1789 who were now clearly running away from the radicals and toward the king. This was confirmed just a few days later when the National Assembly got word that England and Spain were on the brink of war.

[(10:42)](#!):

If war did break out, France might have to make good on its long-standing alliance with Spain, the so-called family pact between the two branches of the Bourbon royal dynasty. With the war clouds brewing, Louis did what kings of France had done for time immemorial. He issued orders to prepare warships for possible engagement. War and peace, after all, were the king’s business. That much, at least, we can agree on. The members of the society of 1789 were certainly willing to entertain that idea, and so in response to the king’s orders, they pushed through the National Assembly a retroactive ratification of Louis’ actions.

[(11:20)](#!):

But their erstwhile allies on the far left wanted no part of this. They saw the National Assembly now more than ever as the sovereign political body, and thus the only body that could legitimately declare war or negotiate peace.

[(11:34)](#!):

From May the 15th until the 22nd, the National Assembly raged over this question. Even the rapidly declining conservatives got in on the action, putting forward a proposal for the king to have sole discretion over war and peace. The radical Jacobins rejoined that no, the National Assembly will have sole discretion over war and peace. Which left the center wide open for the members of the society of 1789 to come in and say it should be a decision reached jointly. In a somewhat stunning turn, this was the moment when the Comte de Mirabeau showed which side he was really on by supporting this mixed system. And that was the formula that carried the day.

[(12:14)](#!):

Luckily for everyone, England and Spain did not go to war at that moment, so none of this was put to the immediate test, but the debate did prove that the liberal nobles, who always considered themselves to be the natural leaders of the revolution, were finally in the driver’s seat. Right, where they had always thought they belonged.

[(12:33)](#!):

Shortly after this victory, the society of 1789 then backed the abbey CS for the president’s chair. Which I haven’t mentioned, but you may have realized was an office in the National Assembly elected on a monthly basis. Anyway, the 1789ers backed CS over the radical Jacobin candidate and CS won. In the wake of this battle, Mirabeau and Talleyrande both walked out of the Jacobin club never to return, and when they departed, others quickly followed.

[(13:01)](#!):

So the initiative was now with the society of 1789, and they strengthened their own position by offering associate member status to delegates who couldn’t afford the fairly steep dues expected of full members. Soon they had about 160 delegates on their rolls, including most of the guys who had walked out of the Jacobins back in March. Meanwhile the Jacobin club itself was left with almost the same number, because the walkouts were hitting them hard.

[(13:30)](#!):

But though the left had now split into two camps, that did not mean they disagreed on everything. And so, after the divisive debates of May, they came together in June to tackle the fates of those men who formally comprised the first estate, and those men who formally comprised the second estate. After closing the debate on declarations of war, the National Assembly returned to the question of the Catholic Church. Its lands had been taken by the nation, its monastic orders had been suppressed, its tithes had been abolished. So now that everything was stripped away, it was time to decide what would be built up to replace it.

[(14:06)](#!):

This issue was debated for just over a month, and with the society of 1789 and the Jacobins more in agreement than disagreement, this debate was not nearly as contentious as the resulting total reorganization of the French Catholic Church might suggest. But since the resulting civil constitution of the clergy wouldn’t be formally adopted until July the 12th, I want to set that aside for a minute so I can talk about the big thing that happened in the interim. The complete suppression of hereditary nobility, privileges, emblems, and offices. As with the night of August the 4th, the suppression of hereditary privilege kind of came out of nowhere during an evening session of the National Assembly.

[(14:51)](#!):

On the night of June the 19th, the Jacobins decided to stage a weird little piece of theater where a group of about 30 foreigners, each decked out in their native garb, came in to laud the assembly for the universal rights they had proclaimed for men of all nationalities. This was all a very odd and very transparent little bit of stagecraft, and it was fairly well known that these guys, whoever they were, had rented their native garb from the Paris Opera. But after this stage disruption was over, a real disruption burst forth. A delegate, apparently on his own initiative, stepped up and moved that in keeping with the universal equality of man that they had all just applauded, that hereditary titles should be abolished.

[(15:35)](#!):

With the door thus opened, the waters came flooding in. More delegates, mainly our liberal noble friends, rushed in to denounce all marks of noble status. They renounced their coats of arms, their special liveries, their inherited titles, and any social distinction that they enjoyed strictly on the basis of their quote-unquote nobility. The few conservatives in the hall tried to halt this flood, pointing out quite rightly that the routine of the National Assembly had become major national issues during the day, more provincial or limited issues in the evening. The suppression of hereditary rights had no place being debated in an evening session.

[(16:16)](#!):

But of course, the ever-present audience was ever-present. The boos and catcalls rained down on the conservatives. The cheers embraced every liberal who stepped up to suggest some other odious mark of nobility that could be ditched. When the vote came in, it wasn’t even close. And soon enough, the member roles of the National Assembly no longer contained any mention of the Marquis de Lafayette. Instead, you have some guy named Monsieur de Montier.

[(16:43)](#!):

No more Comte de Mirabeau. Now he was styling himself simply Gabriel Raquette. Conservative nobles were aghast. They had already given up all their feudal rights, and now they were barred from the few remaining social trinkets they had to show that they were still better than the commoners. You’re stripping me of both my honor and my identity. This would mark the beginning of a steady wave of emigration, as these nobles simply couldn’t live in a kingdom they no longer recognized, and which no longer recognized them. Years later, a few leftist delegates looked back on the night of June the 19th with some regret, believing that the whole exercise had turned sullen nobles reluctantly giving way to the new order into implacable enemies, ready to fight the revolution to the death.

[(17:32)](#!):

With that sudden business out of the way, we can now turn our attention back to an item that will be even more fatal to the continued unity of the French nation, the civil constitution of the clergy. When last we left the clergy, they had been getting pretty well kicked around by the National Assembly, which was clearly driving to make the Church subservient to the French nation. As to this kicking around, listener Joseph asks a very simple question. Just out of curiosity, what’s the reaction of the Pope to all this?

[(18:03)](#!):

It’s a good question, and the answer is the Pope did not like it one bit. In March, he condemned both the declaration of the rights of man and the steady assault on the autonomy of the French Church, both of which were incompatible with true Catholicism. Adding to the Pope’s heartburn was the fact that citizens of the little enclave of Avignon, well within the French frontier but long controlled by the papacy, started making noises about reuniting with their French brothers, and pretty soon riots would break out with the local pro-French annexationists winning control of the city.

[(18:37)](#!):

But the National Assembly, aware that they were already pushing the Pope to the limits of toleration, weren’t in much hurry to annex Avignon just yet, lest the Pope declare some kind of holy war. Now until this point, relations between France and the Vatican had been governed by the Concordant of Bologna, agreed to back in 1516. The Concordant of Bologna said many things, but among the most important was that the French king would henceforth appoint all candidates for high office in the French Church, and the Pope would merely confirm those appointments.

[(19:14)](#!):

And that’s how it had worked for the last 275 years, the Pope wielding a theoretical veto, but one that was little used in practice.

[(19:22)](#!):

But as the new civil constitution of the clergy was debated in the National Assembly, the delegates told the king that he needed to prepare to bring the Concordant to an end, because in all likelihood we’re about to vote to end the Pope having any role whatsoever in the selection of French clergy. And indeed, the formula that the committee produced said that the Pope is still obviously the visible head of the universal church and his spiritual authority is unchallenged, but henceforth he would be merely notified of appointments. Which is a fairly momentous challenge to the Pope’s authority. Gee, I wonder if he’ll accept it without a fight.

[(20:00)](#!):

Now the interesting thing about the civil constitution of the clergy is that though in time it would help kill any lingering goodwill between the revolutionaries and the church, most of its specific tenets were actually welcomed by the French clergy. Indeed, many of these tenets were drawn directly from the original grievance lists of the first estate delegates. The clergymen would now be paid a state salary instead of living off of tithes. But regular priests would see their pay go up, while bishops would see their pay dramatically go down. Less wealth disparity within the church had been a major complaint, and now it was all squared away.

[(20:37)](#!):

On top of that, the civil constitution imposed residency requirements on clergymen, so no more of this absentee bishop stuff where guys like Talleyrand can be the bishop of Uton without ever stepping foot in Uton. There would also now be service requirements for promotion, so no more courtier’s sons who can barely get through a mass suddenly being appointed bishop. And then, any part of the church not directly involved in cure of souls, that is actually ministering to the spiritual health of a flock, well those were just abolished, reaffirming among other things the suppression of all those monastic orders. All of this was right in line with what the majority of the first estate delegates had been asking for.

[(21:20)](#!):

The only thing that was really controversial was that the clerics would now stand for election like any other public office, from the simplest parish priest to the mightiest bishop. But though the priests and bishops wouldn’t be subjected to the same electoral bodies, they would both be subjected to electoral bodies that might include Protestants, atheists, and even Jews.

[(21:40)](#!):

The idea that those heathen dogs would have any say at all in who could and could not be a Catholic priest was enough to make the stomach of any devout Catholic term. But it was in keeping with the spirit of the times. The church’s new role in the constitutional order would be to support the moral and spiritual well-being of the nation, the whole nation, nothing more and nothing less. All of this was debated, worked through and revised through June, and the civil constitution of the clergy was finally approved on July 12, 1790.

[(22:13)](#!):

But though it appears that the majority of the clergy were prepared to accept it, the sad-sack Ancien Regime bishops notwithstanding, there was still one enormous question left on the table. What if the pope came out and said to the French clergy, you must not accept this? That would leave them and the French nation in quite a bind. And indeed, when he did, it did. But we will leave that confrontation for an episode or two down the road, because I want to wrap up today with the big mega-party that France celebrated two days later, on the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.

[(22:52)](#!):

Just to back up a little bit, after the Women’s March on Versailles, which represented a triumph of popular will over absolute monarchy, the institution that best represented that triumph was the National Guard. And the National Guard soon came to represent a very specific form of popular will. Because after the active-passive-citizen distinction was established, it was further decreed that only active citizens could volunteer for the National Guard. And over that winter they did, in patriotic droves, the true citizens of France joining the militia that would defend the nation from its enemies both internal and external.

[(23:31)](#!):

Alongside the patriotic rise of the active citizens’ National Guard were spontaneous feasts celebrating the federation of the nation, the unity of the French people, and the universal values proclaimed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man. With these improvised parties cropping up all across France, the Paris Commune got together in May and said, hey, we should do one of these too, and it should be the biggest one yet. We’ll call it the F\xc3\xaate de la F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration, the Feast of the Federation, and we’ll hold it on the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille.

[(24:05)](#!):

Now since Lafayette was the head of the National Guard, and Bayi was the mayor of Paris, both were leading members of the Society of 1789, obviously what the Society of 1789 had to say about all this was pretty critical. And after some hesitation, they decided to back the plan. They were definitely coming to the conclusion that the revolution was winding down, and it was time to start thinking about how they were going to perpetuate the new order. And big commemorative ceremonies are a handy way to celebrate everything that’s happened, while also implying that those days are now in the past.

[(24:39)](#!):

Conservatives, of course, were appalled by the whole notion of a giant party celebrating the demise of everything they held dear. But as it turned out, the radicals weren’t too keen on the idea either. There were some pretty deep suspicions that Lafayette and his cronies were planning some kind of political coup backed by the active citizen-filled National Guard.

[(24:59)](#!):

But though this was emphatically not Lafayette’s plan, the great F\xc3\xaate de la F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration was going to invite representatives from every National Guard company in France to come march in a great procession. With tens of thousands of guardsmen expected to attend, was it really a stretch to wonder what use Lafayette might put them to? Sure, the Parisian units had stood up to him during the Women’s March on Versailles, but all the passive citizens had now been weeded out, so who knows where their loyalties now lay. But despite the misgivings of both the conservatives and the radicals, preparations for the party moved forward. With something like 400,000 people expected to attend, the Champs de Mars was selected as the only suitable site. If you’ve ever been to Paris, it’s now the big park where the Eiffel Tower is.

[(25:48)](#!):

The plan was to transform the field into a very Romanesque space, with triumphal arches and a great altar to the Fatherland as the centerpiece of the show. But with only a few weeks to get everything done, it turned out that there was too much to do and not enough workers to do it. So in a scene almost as moving as the celebration itself, Parisians of every social stripe came out to help finish the job. Nobles worked alongside commoners, artisans with lawyers, men with women. Even the royal family came down to oversee the project and lend a hand. All driven, it seemed, by simple patriotic solidarity.

[(26:26)](#!):

In the days leading up to the feast, representatives from the provincial National Guard units began to arrive, and they were offered space to camp in the Tuileries Garden, where the king would come down and greet them and mingle with them. It really was starting to look like the revolution was over. On the morning of July the 14th itself, it started to rain and rain heavily. But the crappy weather could dampen no spirits. The assembled National Guardsmen marched down the streets of Paris towards the Champs de Mars. Along the way, they were joined by all the National Assembly delegates, and when they all reached the Champs de Mars, they paraded through the hundreds of thousands of onlookers, miserable in the driving rain, but otherwise pretty buoyant.

[(27:08)](#!):

The king and delegates of the National Assembly sat together on a stage off to one side of the great altar, signaling the unity of the new constitutional order. And then at about 3.30, Bishop Talleyrand, I think the only bishop willing to do the job, proceeded with an opening Mass in benediction. And if he screwed it up, as he was very nervous he would do, not being much for religious ceremonies by nature, it helped that no one could really hear him. Then Lafayette came forward, and he took center stage. It was undoubtedly the high point of his life and career.

[(27:41)](#!):

As a young man, he had fought for the cause of liberty with the noble Americans, and then he had come home and fought for the same liberties for his fellow countrymen. He was the commander of the National Guard, he was a key leader in the ascendant political club of the day, his own personal values had become enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Now he stood in front of hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens, as the most popular, well-known and distinguished leader probably in the whole nation. It was all as he had no doubt seen in his head a thousand times before. He was fulfilling his destiny as the hero of two worlds.

[(28:20)](#!):

At just about five o’clock, Lafayette climbed up on a great white horse and rode over to ask the king and president of the assembly permission to administer the great oath to his National Guardsmen. Then he returned to the altar, and he pledged, we swear forever to be faithful to the nation, to the law, and to the king, to uphold with all our might the constitution as decided by the National Assembly and accepted by the king, and to protect, according to the laws, the safety of people and properties, transit of grains and food within the kingdom, the public contributions under whatever forms they might exist, and to stay united with all the French with the indestructible bounds of brotherhood.

[(29:04)](#!):

The Guardsmen then followed this oath. Fireworks cracked, lit, and thundered. Then the king stood to take an oath of his own to defend the constitution, and critically he referred to himself not as the King of France and Navarre, but as King of the French. He was now a leader of men, not a ruler of some abstract land. The queen then held up their young son dressed in National Guardsmen’s uniform and proclaimed that the boy would be raised on the values of constitutional government.

[(29:34)](#!):

With these momentous declarations declared, the ceremony proper broke up and everyone retired back to the city to party, which they did pretty much uninterrupted for the next week straight. But of course, we all now know that the F\xc3\xaate de la F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration was nowhere near the end of the French Revolution, not by a long shot. Next week, the fissures that had been artfully papered over for the celebration will rip back open. The \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 conservatives will plot their revenge. Radical political agitators will demand even more revolutionary reforms. Lafayette and the liberal nobles will try desperately to hold the center.

[(30:14)](#!):

And King Louis will change his mind, and then re-change his mind about what he thought about all of this. And then of course, in the capitals of Europe, the statesmen of the great powers talked amongst themselves about how best to exploit the situation in France.

[(01:43)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions, episode 3.17, a temporary summit.

[(02:01)](#!):

After the great feast of the Federation, France passed into a period of outward calm as everyone went through the motions of trying to make the new order they had just celebrated work in practice. But as I hinted earlier, beneath the surface, there were surprisingly few people dedicated to defending what had just been celebrated, least of all the king himself, because though Louis was, for the moment, playing the part of citizen king, happily working alongside the people’s representatives, he was privately dejected by the lot that had fallen on him and his family, the monarchy, and the whole of the kingdom. The concessions he had made had been forced on him by servants, but Louis he had made had been forced on him by circumstances, and he was just waiting for the opportunity to renege as soon as circumstances changed.

[(02:48)](#!):

But he was not the only one who saw the current constitutional settlement as anything but permanent. Conservatives, both inside and outside of France, were just biding their time, waiting for the revolutionaries to falter so that heathen dogs could be swept aside once and for all. And the most reactionary of the emigre nobles weren’t just biding their time, they were actively working to overthrow the new order.

[(03:10)](#!):

Meanwhile, the Jacobin radicals were developing policy proposals that would take France even further down the road to full national regeneration, to say nothing of the ultra-radical working-class Parisians who were just starting to organize politically and wanted to turn the world upside down. In the summer of 1790, only Lafayette and his liberal noble brethren in the Society of 1789 looked at the current situation and liked what they saw. Everyone else saw it as a temporary summit to either climb back down from, or push further on up from.

[(03:45)](#!):

But though all these tensions swirled under the surface, a year would pass before France would be hit by another one of those revolutionary tornadoes that would send everything spinning out of control. So today, I want to go back and pick up a few of the lingering constitutional issues that the National Assembly dealt with after moving to Paris, and then set up all the players on the board for the next major crisis that would hit in June 1791, when the king tried to bolt from France in the middle of the night.

[(04:16)](#!):

So the first thing we need to talk about is the total administrative reorganization of France. Especially because of all the permanent contributions made by the revolution to modern France, this one is the most prominent and longest lasting.

[(04:30)](#!):

If you’ll recall from way back in episode two, The Broken Regime, one of the things that plagued Ancien Regime France was the administrative chaos. Provinces didn’t line up with the generalit\xc3\xa9, and those didn’t line up with the jurisdictions of the parlomat, which didn’t line up with the church diocese, which didn’t line up with tax regions, and all of the divisions had these customs barriers erected between every other division. It was a mess, everyone knew it, but trying to untangle it would require massive social, political, and economic upheaval. But now that France was already dealing with massive social, political, and economic upheaval, well, we may as well clean up this mess while we have the opportunity. And after the move to Paris in October 1789, the National Assembly took up the question of administrative rationalization in earnest.

[(05:19)](#!):

The first suggested reorganization, though, was frankly a little too rational. This initial plan called for France to be divided up into 80 square shaped departments, equal in size. This number was quickly bumped up to 81 to fit in with a nested administrative system based on the number 9. So there would be 81 departments, each department would be divided into 9 districts, and those districts would be divided into 9 communes, with each level having an elected assembly to govern it.

[(05:50)](#!):

But as geometrically sound as the plan was, it was a wee bit rigid for a kingdom that had cultural, linguistic, and geographic divisions that stretch back into the misty past. So the Comp de Mirabeau got up and said, yes, we need to rationalize the administrative map, but these straight lines are no good. We need to take into account natural borders like mountains and rivers, and then account for both the number of people and kind of people who will actually wind up grouped together. This was a much more difficult task, obviously, but the National Assembly heeded Mirabeau’s advice, and went back to the drawing board.

[(06:27)](#!):

But though what they came back with fit France a bit more naturally, one of the objectives of the new system was to push the heterogeneous subjects of the king into becoming homogeneous citizens of the nation, so old ethnic and cultural divisions were deliberately ignored, hopefully creating a more unified France in the process. So in February 1790, they produced a new map of 83 departments, roughly equal in size, but with borders that made a bit more sense in the real world. These new departments would become the subunit of French administration.

[(07:00)](#!):

Tax assessment and collection, civil and criminal jurisdictions, even the diocese of the newly organized French church would be forced to fit into the departmental system. There would be elected assemblies at every level, who would work in concert with the elected assemblies above them and below them to ensure that every citizen, active citizen for the moment, both happens to be a member of the community, both had a say in lawmaking and then had the means to carry out the law uniformly and equally in every corner of the nation.

[(07:34)](#!):

It goes without saying that any lingering rights and privileges enjoyed by this ancient province or that special generalit\xc3\xa9 were just straight up nullified, and that did cause some friction here and there. Plus, the new system inevitably undermined the prestige of, say, Grenoble, one of just 13 seats of the parliament, and was now merely one of 83 departmental capitals. But other cities welcomed the reorganization as it elevated backwaters into local political, economic, and cultural hubs.

[(08:06)](#!):

But critically, it was still to be determined what the relationship would be between the national government seated in Paris and the local government seated in the departmental capitals. And that is going to be a thing.

[(08:20)](#!):

When all the elections started being held for the local and departmental offices over the course of 1790, a few things became apparent. First, there were a dizzying array of elections. In the new order, everyone had to be elected. Judges, mayors, assemblymen, even priests. The average French citizen suddenly went from having no say in who was going to be appointed to public office, to being required to weigh in on every candidate for public office. It was an unexpected burden. And as the revolution progresses, one thing we’ll see is that electoral turnout will drop to the point where blanket non-participation was practically the rule. And guys serving, for example, in the Paris Commune would be literally elected by dozens of votes. And that’s not the margin of victory. That’s the total number of votes. So the dream of democratic participation definitely ran into the reality of political fatigue, indifference, and alienation, especially after politics becomes a super deadly business to get mixed up in.

[(09:25)](#!):

The other thing that became apparent is that though France now had a whole new administrative apparatus, the personnel actually doing the administrating changed very little at first. Of course, new men fired up by the revolution entered the system for the first time, and old men turned off by the revolution withdrew. But there was a pretty good swath of public officials in the middle who adapted quite naturally to the new order. So old counselors of the parliament stood for and won the judgeships in their new departments. Men appointed by the king to serve at the local level simply took off their royal robes and donned the revolutionary cockade. Many indeed were local aristocratic nobles who just stopped using their titles after those titles had been suppressed and recast themselves as citizens with experience and an aptitude for public management. And they would, of course, win because who else was going to do it? So though the revolution seems to be so obviously a clean break with the past, nothing can ever be quite so clean. And through these first years, public administration was as much a continuation as it was a total reinvention.

[(10:32)](#!):

Along with this major rationalization of the administrative apparatus, the National Assembly pursued other political and economic reforms that showed their continued commitment to the kind of enlightenment ideals held by the old philosophs, and now best represented by the liberal nobles of the Society of 1789.

[(10:51)](#!):

So old marks of tyranny like the Lettres des Cach\xc3\xa9 and those unjustly levied taxes like the Gabelle that despise salt tax, and the Lettres des Cach\xc3\xa9 that despise salt tax were abolished. But as much as these decrees aligned with the desires of most French citizens, active or passive, the National Assembly also made moves that would help alienate the lower classes from the supposed leaders of the revolution. So for example, just as they were abolishing Lettres des Cach\xc3\xa9 and the Gabelle, the National Assembly also took a look at which feudal dues and rights would be abolished in the spirit of the night of August the fourth, and which required some form of monetary compensation.

[(11:30)](#!):

The private property-loving delegates wound up classifying most of the dues as real property, and so not really subject to the sweeping declarations of August the fourth. But though this classification rankled those who found out about it, out in the provinces, or should I now say out in the departments, good luck getting the average peasant to understand the difference.

[(11:51)](#!):

Then, they made another fairly big step away from public opinion, but it was all right in keeping with their own philosophy when they reintroduced free trade in grain. That, as you can imagine, earned them quite a bit of ill will from the Paris mobs, who were now surrounding the deliberations of the National Assembly, and of whom we will speak directly.

[(12:13)](#!):

But this was matched by the abolition of all internal customs barriers, which no one in their right mind could complain about. So throughout 1790, we see the National Assembly pursuing an enlightened agenda that at times earned them heaps of praise, and other times heaps of scorn. They were all doing their best to heal old wounds, but unfortunately, in the process, they opened up a few new ones.

[(12:39)](#!):

So shortly after France as a whole was reorganized, Paris underwent a similar transformation, and I’ll use that transformation to pivot into a discussion of the pieces that would be on the board come the royal family’s ill-fated flight from Paris in June 1791. We’ll start with the radicalizing lower-class mobs of Paris, and then move our way across the political spectrum, before rounding out today’s episode with a brief look at the army and the clergy, both of whom are currently being torn asunder.

[(13:13)](#!):

So, as you’ll recall, the city of Paris had been rechristened the Paris Commune after the fall of the Bastille, and representatives from the 60 districts of the city now ran Paris from the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville with Sylvain Bailly as mayor. But one particular section, the Cordelie, immediately started making a great nuisance of itself. The men and women of that most radical district had played a central role in the storming of the Bastille, and they now found themselves cast aside as mere passive citizens. And so for them, the revolution was now on the verge of being utterly betrayed, and they railed against Bailly and Lafayette and the whole agenda of the Society of 1789.

[(13:56)](#!):

Jean-Paul Marat, that most inflammatory of newspapermen, set up shop in the Cordelie, where he was safe to publish his screeds without fear of reprisal. Well, mostly without fear. In January 1790, he had set his pen against Lafayette in particular, and once the rhetoric got ugly enough, a warrant was finally issued for Marat’s arrest. But the good people of the Cordelie district refused to let the police execute the warrant, and Marat safely made his way into hiding.

[(14:25)](#!):

Partly in response to the hyper-radical sentiments now spewing forth from the district, the Paris Commune voted to rejigger the district lines, producing now 48 sections that erased the Cordelie from the map as an autonomous unit. But in response to this attack, the popular agitators in the Cordelie rallied and formed a political club to keep up the fight, because that was just the sort of thing you did in those days. And thus, the Cordelie Club was born in April 1790, though it was officially called the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

[(15:03)](#!):

Their goal was to defend the universal rights proclaimed by that sacred document, which already seemed to be eroding, as fancy-pants nobles and their slick-talking lawyer friends refused to even recognize the vast majority of Frenchmen as full citizens. In keeping with their egalitarian ideology, the Cordelie Club required less than two livre as an entry fee, and thus drew in what the Society of 1789 and even the Jacobins might dismiss as the dregs of society, but which they themselves called the people.

[(15:38)](#!):

The club was led by the soon-to-be major revolutionary figure, Georges Danton, and was supported by the pens of Marat and Desmoulas, who called the Cordelie District the only sanctuary where liberty had not been violated. It was from these beginnings that the working class sans-culottes would be drawn, organized, and directed as a potent political force.

[(16:03)](#!):

To the right of the populist Cordelie, but well to the left of everyone else, was the Jacobin Club. They had taken their licks of late, as many original members defected to the Society of 1789, but their open-door membership policy did not keep them down for long. By August 1790, there were fully 1,200 members in the Paris Club and 150 affiliate clubs scattered across France, mostly in major urban areas where middle-class intellectuals tended to gather.

[(16:34)](#!):

True, they were not able to dominate roll calls in the National Assembly anymore, but their message was beginning to spread far and wide. The defection of so many liberal nobles paved the way for speeches and pamphlets promoting universal education, opposition to the Catholic Church, equal rights before the law, even hinting around the idea that maybe France ought to be a republic, though officially the Jacobins supported a constitutional monarchy. They also continued to push for an end to the distinction between active and passive citizens, which they thought unjustly disenfranchised the vast majority of the population.

[(17:12)](#!):

It was this last point that put them in a box with the populous radicals in the Cordelier Club, and though neither side really liked or trusted the other, when their forces would combine over this issue they would form a revolutionary juggernaut. That said, for the moment the Jacobin Club was still in the main moderate, not yet having shed itself off the die-hard constitutional monarchists who would first rise above their more radical brothers, and then be felled by them shortly thereafter. To the right of the Jacobins was, of course, the Society of 1789, at this moment the Ascendant Party.

[(17:52)](#!):

They controlled most of the key political positions in France. Lafayette, head of the National Guard, Bailly, mayor of Paris, six of the eight members of the National Assembly’s all-important Constitutional Committee, and then, over the rest of 1790, almost all the presidents elected to lead the National Assembly were members of the club. On top of that, these guys were able to start shouldering their way right into the Royal Ministry itself, at least by proxy.

[(18:22)](#!):

The National Assembly had passed a decree back in November 1789, stating that delegates could not become royal ministers, a law designed to prevent anyone from wielding power in both wings of government simultaneously. This came as a blow to the Comte de Mirabeau, who appears to have been angling for just such an appointment into the ministry. Denied the opportunity to do it out in the open, the great orator of the people and vocal defender of the revolution secretly offered his services to the royal family as a paid advisor, and early in 1790, Louis accepted the offer, much to his own distaste.

[(19:00)](#!):

After that, Mirabeau’s extensive debts were suddenly gone, and though he continued his public role as orator for the people, he was simultaneously doing his best to see that the king’s position was stabilized and even enhanced. The revelation that Mirabeau was a paid agent of the monarchy would not come out until after he died and was given the first great hero’s funeral of the revolution.

[(19:25)](#!):

By September 1790, the power of the society of 1789 was such that they were able to finally force the resignation of Jacques Neckerre, who had been hanging on as a sort of useless appendage all these months, and that triggered a little wave of ministerial reshuffling over the next few weeks that saw men closely associated with either Lafayette or Mirabeau appointed to key positions. So as 1790 drew to a close, the liberal nobles were absolutely in the driver’s seat and appeared to control the Paris Commune, the National Assembly, and the royal ministry.

[(20:00)](#!):

But as quickly as they had risen to power, history would soon dispense with them. And in case you’re wondering, almost every member of the society of 1789 will wind up either dead or in exile. But for the moment, the society of 1789 and their fellow travelers still orbited the revolution. Outside the orbit of the revolution, however, were the unreconstructed conservatives on the far right of the political spectrum, many of whom were now choosing voluntary exile rather than submitting to the new order.

[(20:35)](#!):

The first wave of emigration came after the fall of the Bastille when the Comte d’Artois and his friends left the country, eventually setting up a little court in exile in Turin, Italy. Other waves of emigration followed as the great fear in the summer of 1789 erupted, and then after the women’s march on Versailles in October. Every day, it seemed some noble decided that he had reached the end of the line, packed up his things, and quietly slipped across the border.

[(21:01)](#!):

Some of these emigrants were content to wait out the storm patiently, but others led by the Comte d’Artois dedicated themselves to playing the role of the French to plotting an end to the revolution. To this end, they did their best to foment unrest inside of France, and then convinced the European powers outside France to come to the aid of their beleaguered royal family.

[(21:23)](#!):

For the work inside France, their best angle was the revolutionary assault on the Catholic Church, which we’ll talk about even more in a second. Beginning in the spring of 1790, that is, just as the civil constitution of the clergy was being worked out, the first genuine counter-revolutionary demonstrations began to break out, mostly in the south of France, where a.) emigrate agents could easily stay in contact with their masters in turn, and b.) the long-dormant Protestant community was starting to come out from under the shadows, much to the dismay of local Catholics.

[(21:58)](#!):

With these quasi-uprisings spreading, d’Artois and his followers laid plans for a huge coordinated rebellion all across southern France. When word of the plot reached Louis, though, he sent back orders to stop the planned uprising, believing it would only make a bad situation worse, to which d’Artois responded that he and his friends must continue to serve the king and queen in spite of themselves. In the end, though, the plot was halted, but only because agents of the counter-revolutionary emigres were apprehended in Lyon in December 1790, with all the written details of the whole conspiracy in their pockets. The uprising fizzled out.

[(22:40)](#!):

For the work outside France, the emigres bombarded the courts of Europe with pleas for assistance, money, troops, intelligence, sanctuary, anything, everything\xe2\x80\x94all of this much to the great annoyance of those courts of Europe. To this end, the emigres generally stressed how the contagion of the revolution might begin to spread across Europe. The Declaration of the Rights of Man was intended not just for the French, but for everyone, so if you don’t want to wind up like our poor king and queen, now trapped in their palace by degenerate mobs, you’d better help us out here.

[(23:16)](#!):

But for the moment, the heads of Europe had no intention of getting into it. Even the Holy Roman Emperor brothers of Marie Antoinette, first Joseph II, and then Leopold II after Joseph died in September 1790, well, they all but ignored the cries of their sister and her in-laws. They were far more concerned about the situation in the East, the continued ambitions of Catherine the Great, and the fate of Poland. Prussia seemed slightly more interested in armed intervention, but only as a way to gobble up more territory, not to help the king overcome his domestic troubles. Britain, of course, wanted no part of any of this whatsoever.

[(23:55)](#!):

Indeed, the European powers actually got together in July 1790 to try to settle any differences they had with each other on their western fronts. The resulting Treaty of Reichenbach swapped around some territory and gave permission to Austria to go back in and reassert control over the Austrian Netherlands, not with an eye on further action in France, but rather clearing up old business so that everyone could focus on the East, where it was agreed the real action was, now that France could no longer trouble them.

[(24:25)](#!):

The frustrated \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s were thus left mostly to their own devices, only finding real support among the minor German princes on the French border, whose property and rights were being attacked directly by the revolutionaries. And it was there that the Comp d’Artois \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 court found a new home, after the King of Sardinia kicked them out of Turin for causing him nothing but headaches. So that’s how the political landscape lay at the beginning of 1791, with most everyone just waiting for something to break so they could rush in and push France in their own chosen direction, forward or backward, left or right.

[(25:02)](#!):

We’ll wrap up today with a brief look at the tensions inside two great institutions that had once been critical to the social fabric of Ancien regime society, and which were now fraying apart, the army, and of course, the Catholic Church. Now we talked a bit about how at odds with itself the army had become in the last years of the Ancien regime. Well, since the fall of the Bastille, things have only gotten worse.

[(25:32)](#!):

The army, as you’ll recall, was divided into three basic camps. Aristocratic senior officers, disgruntled over the very fact of the revolution, commoner, or not aristocratic enough, junior officers, disgruntled at being held back by their aristocratic superiors, and then regular soldiers, disgruntled about, you know, the things that regular soldiers are always disgruntled about. Between the fall of the Bastille and the feast of the Federation, these tensions became unbearable, and acts of disobedience and near-mutiny started cropping up in garrisons across France.

[(26:05)](#!):

On top of that, the Jacobin correspondence club was now in full effect, and local branches started coaching junior officers and common soldiers on the finer points of revolutionary politics. With these politically motivated tensions reaching the breaking point, many senior officers felt compelled to simply stop giving orders that might trigger acts of disobedience, or they themselves chose to become \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, slipping across the border, leaving their regiments without a leader. The French army was, at the moment, very much paralyzed.

[(26:40)](#!):

Finally, in August 1790, the inevitable finally came when a full-blown mutiny broke out in the garrison of Nascis on the northeastern frontier. A soldier’s committee in one of the regiments, very likely prompted by local Jacobins, demanded to see the regimental book so they could be audited. When rebuffed, they arrested the quartermaster, locked their officers up in some barracks, and then grabbed hold of the regimental treasury. The other regiments of the Nasi garrison followed suit, and pretty soon the soldiers were in charge. The mutiny was complete.

[(27:14)](#!):

When word reached Paris, the National Assembly was shocked and worried about what this might mean for discipline everywhere. Obviously, in due course, the grievances of the soldiers would have to be addressed, but mutiny was not the answer, and it could not be tolerated. So they ordered in 4,500 soldiers from down the road in Mest to put down the mutineers. The officer in charge was himself an arch-conservative named General Dubouillet, who would soon earn a further place in history for himself by helping to arrange that ill-fated escape attempt by the royal family that I keep alluding to.

[(27:51)](#!):

When Dubouillet got to Nasi, he demanded the captive officers be released, and the ringleaders of the mutiny handed over. But before any terms could be worked out, mutineers manning some artillery fired into Dubouillet’s men, killing 60. A small but bloody battle then erupted, and soon something like 500 men lay dead, mostly mutineers. After this mutiny had been crushed then, 22 men were hanged on the spot. Another 42 were sentenced to 30 years hard labor, and 72 just sent off to prison.

[(28:26)](#!):

This brutal suppression and punishment were officially approved of by the National Assembly as necessary to restore discipline, but radical populists in the Cordelgee Club and the Jacobin Club could see nothing in all this but re-entrenching tyranny, and it helped further their anger at Lafayette and his whole gang of liberal nobles, who now seem to be openly embracing a downright reactionary posture. So that brings us finally back around to the French Catholic Church, who are about to become even more estranged from the revolution than they had ever been.

[(29:03)](#!):

Now we left them off last time, beaten down by the civil constitution of the clergy, but as I said, the majority of the clergy were willing to go along with the program, if this could just please be the end of it. Indeed, French clergymen sent messages over to the pope, all but begging him to let them go along with the new order. Even King Louis tried to convince the Vatican to accept at least parts of the new order, rather than risk an all-out schism.

[(29:30)](#!):

But unfortunately for them, and somewhat inexplicably for history, the pope decided to say nothing about it one way or the other. So in August 1790, when the king officially promulgated the civil constitution, most of the clergy did go along with it, assuming that some sort of tacit agreement had been worked out with Rome. But no tacit agreement was in fact worked out, and as the months passed, members of the clergy became less and less sure that they could go forward without definitive support from the pope.

[(29:60)](#!):

Finally, in late October 1790, 30 bishops signed a letter saying they would not accept the new civil constitution because it had not yet been sanctioned by the Vatican. This helped spark protests from existing clergy, as new departmental bishops were being elected. Then, spurred on by local chapters of the Jacobin Club, departmental authorities fired back, and began to move vigorously to enforce the civil constitution, which only led to further resistance and further clashes.

[(30:29)](#!):

In response to all of this, the National Assembly debated what to do, and in late November decided that any clergyman who couldn’t reconcile himself immediately would be dismissed. The test would be the now infamous civic oath, which required them to, quote, be faithful to the nation, the king, and the law, and to uphold with all their power the constitution declared by the National Assembly and accepted by the king. By forcing the clergy to take this oath, the National Assembly was forcing them to publicly choose between their patriotic spirit and their religious convictions. Now, almost all the bishops, save of course Talleyrand and one other guy, refused to take the civic oath. But it wasn’t just the noble ecclesiastics who wouldn’t take it. Men who had so far been along for the revolutionary ride simply couldn’t take this next step, and depending on where they lived, their flocks openly supported their decision.

[(31:28)](#!):

God almighty, or a bunch of anti-clerical radicals in Paris? Gee, I wonder which we should choose. With the deadline of January the 4th, 1791, coming and going, only about half the clergy took the oath, and the rest were summarily dismissed, which began a permanent rupture between traditional religious values and revolutionary politics that would soon lead to, among other things, a full-blown civil war in western France, when a radicalized Paris Commune tried to impose its will on the very Catholic population of the Vaudis.

[(32:06)](#!):

But that is for another day, as indeed is everything else. And next week we will plow on through the first half of 1791, as the king decides to change his mind yet again, and this time heed the advice of his most conservative advisors, that he is in danger, and he needs to get out of France. And as we’ll see, he’ll almost make it too, if only his nose wasn’t so big.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions, Episode 3.18, The Flight to Varennes.

[(01:52)](#!):

Since being dragged down to Paris in October 1789, King Louis XVI had publicly played the part of Citizen King, and he was convincing enough in this role to still be regarded as a benevolent father figure by the average French citizen. But privately, he was sinking deeper and deeper into a morose funk, depressed about what was happening all around him, but also paralyzed by indecision about what he could do in response. One of his sisters commented that Louis’ great problem was that he was deathly afraid of making a mistake, and that this complete lack of self-confidence led him to do whatever seemed to be expedient at any given moment, without following any kind of coherent or consistent plan.

[(02:35)](#!):

In the best of times, Louis probably would have been a fine placeholder king, just another name on a list of forgettable but inoffensive monarchs. But in these worst of times, he just wasn’t up for the job, and he was probably more aware of it than anyone. And today, he will make one of those mistakes he was so terrified of making, and it will wind up costing him dearly.

[(03:01)](#!):

Thus far, the king had been able to swallow the political concessions that had been required of him because that was the path of least resistance. But like the rest of France, this business about the church was starting to erode his ability to work with the revolutionaries. Louis was not some super-pious true believer, but the more the National Assembly turned its guns on the church, the more uneasy Louis became. It was one thing to tolerate anti-clerical screeds in the press, but stripping the church of its property, openly defying the pope, and now demanding all clergymen swear an oath to put the French nation before their own religious scruples? He had accepted the civil constitution of the clergy because he felt powerless to stop it. He had even promulgated it. He had even written to the pope asking the Vatican to sanction it. But in his heart, he did not like any of it one bit. Indeed, after he publicly signed off on the civic oath, he was so concerned about the blasphemy he was authorizing that when his own personal chaplain took the oath, as one might expect the personal chaplain of the king to do, Louis started to avoid him, and he went out of his way to not take communion from any priest who had taken the civic oath.

[(04:16)](#!):

So clearly, there was a public king, seemingly working in harmony with the reforms of the National Assembly, and a private king, who was becoming permanently estranged from the whole project. Up until now, the people of France had only seen the public king. But in June 1791, they would finally get a look at the private king, and once they saw that king, they started asking whether or not they needed any king at all. The first public signal that Louis was not completely on board with the civil constitution or the civic oath came in early February 1791, when two of his aunts, old maids by this point, requested permission to travel to Rome for Holy Week.

[(04:58)](#!):

Now under the new enlightened regime, what use did the royal family have for the Vatican? Ought they not stay in France and enjoy a good patriotic Holy Week overseen by patriotic bishops who had sworn the civic oath?

[(05:11)](#!):

But Louis approved the trip, and gave his permission for his aunts to travel, which caught many, especially in Paris, off guard. Their good benevolent citizen king shouldn’t be letting his family wander off like that, and certainly not to go bow and scrape before the pope. The radical press in Paris started to beat him up pretty good about this, and the story quickly morphed into a tale about this being the beginning of an organized emigration of the whole royal family. They would be let out at intervals for this reason or for that reason, but in the end France would wake up in a few months and discover that the monarchy had flown the coupe.

[(05:46)](#!):

The king’s brother, the Comte d’Artois, had just been busted trying to incite a rebellion in southern France using religion as his wedge issue. And now these two royal aunts are going to piously pay their respects to the pope? It did not sit right with the radicals one bit. But even more surprising than the king allowing his aunts to leave the country was the man who suddenly rose to the king’s defense, the Comte de Mirabeau.

[(06:13)](#!):

Unbeknownst to almost everyone, but suspected by more than a few, Mirabeau had been on the king’s payroll since the spring of 1790 and was sending regular advice to the royal family on how best to weather the revolutionary storm. So when the National Assembly took up the matter of the traveling aunts and turned it into a general discussion about the problem of aristocratic emigration, you know, what can we do about it, Mirabeau got up and said that they should do nothing about it. In fact, they could do nothing about it. Freedom of movement was a core part of liberty, which, if I’m not mistaken, is exactly what we’ve been enshrining in law all these long months. Not only that, if we now turn around and say, well, freedom of movement for regular citizens is one thing, but it doesn’t apply to aristocrats or royalty, well, guess what, guys? We’ve just erected a two-tiered justice system, only now the privilege is working in reverse. If all men are born free, and the law applies equally to everyone, then we can’t stop someone from choosing of their own free will to go visit Italy. That’s crazy.

[(07:17)](#!):

The delegates were surprised to hear the champion of the revolution making this particular case. It may be sound in theory, but in practice, it invited counter-revolutionary disaster, and the delegates elected instead to set up a small committee who would be empowered to make decisions about who could enter France and who could leave France, which was their first foray into controlling the destinies of perceived enemies of the revolution.

[(07:43)](#!):

But the delegates did not know then, but what we do know now is that Mirabeau wasn’t just making this case in the abstract. At this point, there were basically two kinds of left-wing revolutionaries. Those like the leaders of the Populist quarterly club and more radical Jacobins, who believed that the greatest threat to the nation was posed by reactionary conservatives. And then those like the members of the society of 1789 and more moderate Jacobins, who believed that the greatest threat was posed by the violent anarchism of the lower classes.

[(08:15)](#!):

Despite his reputation as the orator of the people, Mirabeau was definitely more afraid of the mob than he was of the nobility. He did not want to go back to the ways of the Ancien regime. But if things kept heading in a radical direction, what good reforms had been made would be lost, and the situation might get a whole lot worse. These guys might actually decide to try to overthrow the monarchy or something.

[(08:38)](#!):

So in private memos to the royal family, he started strongly urging them to figure out a way to get out of Paris. I don’t believe he ever went so far as to advise the king leave the country, but he certainly thought Louis should get out of the capital and the sooner the better. Getting the king and his family away from the clutches of the Paris mobs was becoming critical.

[(08:59)](#!):

Mirabeau’s argument was that the National Assembly was already alienating itself from the rest of the country over the civil constitution of the clergy, and things were about to drift in the direction of civil war. His advice was for the royal family to get out of Paris, go set up a capital in some provincial city, wait for the National Assembly to fatally undermine its own legitimacy, where upon the king could step in, call for new elections, bring in some new sensible men to consolidate a constitutional monarchy built around a strong king who recognized basic civil rights and who listened to his new principal minister of state, me, the Comte de Mirabeau.

[(09:37)](#!):

But for the moment, Louis did not take the advice, though in very short order, he would wish that he had. The first incident that helped push Louis in the direction of getting the hell out of Paris came in late February 1791, from the so-called Day of Daggers.

[(09:55)](#!):

When the press started filling up with stories about the king’s imaginary plot to escape from France, working class patriots started to believe that it was all true, that the king was about to take flight, hook up with the Austrian army, and then come back in and slaughter them all. So in late February 1791, sporadic demonstrations in Paris started coalescing into organized action. On February 28th, a radical commander of the National Guard led about a thousand armed men and women in the direction of a prison on the outskirts of town, intending to tear it down as they had once torn down the Bastille.

[(10:31)](#!):

The prison was targeted both because it too was a symbol of tyranny and was not befitting a free people, but also because of the strong rumor that there was a secret tunnel connecting the prison to the Tuileries palace, through which the king was planning to escape.

[(10:48)](#!):

When word of the looming attack reached Lafayette, who was in charge of keeping peace in Paris, he rode out from his headquarters at the Tuileries to halt the mob. But when he got there, he discovered that there was some pretty generalized wrath going around, and he himself was among the targets. He may have been the hero of two worlds, but his conduct of late had made him a hated figure among the radicals of the quarterly district. Over the course of the day, Lafayette dodged at least three concerted assassination attempts.

[(11:18)](#!):

With things taking such an ugly turn, old aristocrats of the once proud sword nobility got together and expressed concern to each other that the royal family might be targeted next. And indeed, a guy armed with a sword and multiple pistols was stopped trying to get into the palace. So, those old sword nobles did what old sword nobles were supposed to do. They rallied to protect the king. About 400 of them, secretly armed with sabers and daggers, entered the palace one by one on passes arranged by a loyal chamberlain, and they set up a protective ring around the royal family.

[(11:57)](#!):

Okay, so now both major perceived threats to the new order have been activated. The actionary nobles are seizing the palace, while violent mobs are running amok in the streets. And then there’s Lafayette, caught in the middle. Having avoided being assassinated by the people, he now has to rush back to the palace to confront armed nobles who probably despised him even more than the mobs did. For all his dreams of being the great unifying figure who embodied a new enlightened France, Lafayette was discovering that he was actually now hated by practically everyone.

[(12:32)](#!):

I imagine him at this point pining away for the simpler days, when he and his adopted rustic brothers in the Continental Army waged a simple battle for liberty and justice for all. But those days were gone, and surviving a winter in Valley Forge was starting to look like a breeze compared to surviving one day in revolutionary Paris.

[(12:53)](#!):

When he got back to the palace, Lafayette confronted the 400 nobles and demanded that they lay down their weapons. At first the nobles refused, but then King Louis himself told them to heed Lafayette. Defying the National Guard would only invite more danger on all their heads, and so, disgusted, the nobles complied and were escorted from the palace. Almost every one of them was soon on the road out of France to join the growing emigre community and plot their glorious return to smash the revolution and save their dishonored kingdom.

[(13:28)](#!):

As the sun set on the Day of Daggers, both threats to the constitutional order were suppressed. The Paris mob was stopped from tearing down the prison they had intended to demolish, and the armed nobles were broken up. The main casualty of the day’s events was Lafayette standing with everyone, as both conservatives and radicals had now concluded his real sympathies lay with the other side. This was the beginning of a journey that would eventually land him in an Austrian prison.

[(13:58)](#!):

The Comte de Mirabeau was of course delighting now in Lafayette’s growing unpopularity. Though he and Lafayette had a great deal in common, they were now fierce rivals for power, as both sought to be the principal leader of France and the chief steward of a new constitutional monarchy. But Mirabeau did not have long to savor his rivals’ downward spiral, nor would he even get to see that spiral pick up speed after the massacre at the Champs de Mars. Plus it’s unclear whether Mirabeau’s own popularity would have survived had he lived.

[(14:33)](#!):

Because the Day of Daggers allowed the National Assembly to justify further restrictions on emigres and their property, since it was now clear that if they were left to their own devices, they would use every penny they had to fight the revolution. But Mirabeau continued to oppose these restrictions on travel, and debates with his old friends on the left got bitter and personal, especially after Mirabeau tried to come back to the Jacobin Club to defend himself, and was greeted with overt hostility from its leaders.

[(15:03)](#!):

But instead of winding up despised betrayer of the revolution, as so many of his station and beliefs soon would be, Mirabeau managed to die at the perfect moment, and instead became the first great mythic hero of the revolution. At the end of March 1791, Mirabeau suddenly got sick from something. No one was sure what at the time, though the scandal rags had it that it was complications from venereal disease. After lingering for a few days, somewhat melodramatically in the eyes of his old friend Talleyrand, Mirabeau died on April 2nd, 1791.

[(15:39)](#!):

Right away, it was determined that a man as great as Mirabeau deserved something more than just a funeral, and the people of France deserved something more than just a grave to come visit. So his death was seized on as a vehicle to launch a project that had been kicked around for years, and whose time had now come. The idea was to create a space where the best men of France could be buried together in a national tomb, something of a Westminster Abbey for the French. A not-quite-Finnish neoclassical church that had been languishing for lack of funds was appropriated and rechristened the Pantheon. Mirabeau would be the first member of a new cult of national heroes.

[(16:21)](#!):

A huge procession accompanied his body to the new Pantheon that included companies of the National Guard, nearly every member of the National Assembly, and surprisingly, every member of the Jacobin Club. There had been ill will of late, but there was no denying the central role Mirabeau had played in the Revolution. The remains of the Great Order were then interned inside the Pantheon, and from that moment on Mirabeau passed from being a mere mortal to a legendary hero, and his shrine was visited by patriotic citizens throughout the course of the Revolution, and it still remains a central fixture of the Pantheon today.

[(16:58)](#!):

I’m just kidding about that. Once the Paris Commune found out Mirabeau had been in the king’s pay, they disinterred him in 1794, dumped his remains in an unmarked grave, and replaced him in the Pantheon with the recently assassinated Jean-Paul Marat. Of course, it wouldn’t be long before the Revolution took another swing, and Marat was himself disinterred, because that’s how it goes in the French Revolution. So getting back to it. After the Day of Daggers, the rumors that the royal family was getting ready to run only picked up steam, and the king started to seriously wonder if it wasn’t time to make the false rumors true, and his wife was certainly badgering him to do just that.

[(17:40)](#!):

So shortly after the great funeral for Mirabeau, the king finally decided that it was no longer safe in Paris. What finally tilted the balance was an incident in mid-April during the lead-up to Holy Week. The royal family had from time to time gone to visit Saint-Claude, which was a neighborhood close to the city, but far enough away to breathe a little fresh air. In the past, these short trips had not been a problem, but after the Day of Daggers, the radicals in Paris were on hyper-alert, and so when they learned that the royal family was getting ready to leave on a week’s holiday, it screamed escape attempt, and about a thousand men and women rushed down to the Tuileries.

[(18:23)](#!):

When the king and queen emerged from the palace to get into their waiting carriage, they were heckled mercilessly, and the mob closed ranks and refused to let them leave. Lafayette came out and ordered a company of national guardsmen to escort the family through the crowd, but as had happened on the day of the Women’s March on Versailles, the company refused the order, embarrassing Lafayette to no end. For two hours, the family sat inside the carriage, listening to every insult in the book hurled at them while waiting for the crowd to disperse. But the crowd never did disperse, and Lafayette couldn’t get his men to do anything about it. Finally, they all had to call it a day and retreat back into the palace, humiliated and not a little bit scared for their lives.

[(19:10)](#!):

Whatever fiction remained that the king and queen lived in Paris of their own patriotic accord was now obliterated. They were prisoners, and it was time to stage a jailbreak. Over the next two months, a plan was cooked up to sneak the royal family out of Paris.

[(19:27)](#!):

The man who organized the operation was a Swedish count named Axel von Fiercen, who had for many years been one of the queen’s intimates, going back to her early days in France when Louis would have nothing to do with her. They were the same age and just teenagers when they first met, and Fiercen became one of the queen’s most devoted admirers, though whether they ever consummated that mutual admiration is unknown.

[(19:52)](#!):

Inside Paris, the safety of the royal family was put in the hands of General Dubouillet, that guy we talked about last time who put down the mutiny in Nasi. Having proven beyond a shadow of a doubt his dependability, he was trusted with arranging loyal troops to escort the family once they got out of Paris, and then also to arrange for a strong garrison to be waiting to receive them in the fortress of Montmedy, about 200 miles from Paris, right on the border with the Austrian Netherlands.

[(20:23)](#!):

As the appointed day approached, the royal family was urged to travel out of the city separately and in light, fast coaches. But either the king or the queen overruled this advice\xe2\x80\x94I’ve seen both blamed for the decision\xe2\x80\x94and they elected to keep everyone together in a much slower-moving caravan. The plan they settled on was for the family to engage in a little station-swapping. Their governess would pretend to be a Russian countess, while the queen dressed up in the clothes of the governess, and Louis dressed up like the family valet.

[(20:55)](#!):

The Russian baroness would then use a forged passport that listed Frankfurt as her final destination to get past any checkpoints. But there was still the problem of getting the king and queen out of the palace without being detected. For the king, they arranged for a loyal nobleman to come and go in an ostentatious costume in the weeks leading up to the escape. So at midnight on June 20, 1791, Louis dressed himself up in that garish outfit, now a well-known fixture of the palace halls, and strolled boldly out to the carriage without drawing a second glance.

[(21:33)](#!):

The queen, meanwhile, dressed up like the governess and slipped down towards the courtyard separately, but on the way she almost literally bumped into Lafayette making his nightly rounds. She then got turned around after getting flustered, and was almost a half hour late for the rendezvous. This was the first of a series of delays that would help turn the escape attempt into a failed escape attempt. Once they got moving, though, everything seemed to be going according to plan. They switched coaches shortly after exiting the city, then picked up fresh horses right where the fresh horses were supposed to be. By dawn, they were well on their way.

[(22:13)](#!):

But as they crossed a bridge, the carriage hit a post and wiped out, and they were delayed further as the necessary repairs were made to a broken wheel. These delays were now becoming a problem because about halfway along the journey they were supposed to start linking up with the loyal troop escorts. The officer in charge of the first escort waited two hours for the royal family to show, and when they didn’t, he assumed that something had gone wrong, that the plan had either failed or been aborted. So he sent a messenger to the further escort groups waiting down the line, that the plan appears to be off.

[(22:49)](#!):

Now the officer was, of course, wrong about that. But he was nervous about how he was going to explain what he was doing to all the nervous locals who first thought that he was there to demand they start paying all those taxes they were now refusing to pay. And then they became suspicious when the officer told them, no, it has nothing to do with your taxes. I’m just here to protect some treasure that’s going to be on the road here shortly. With the royal family still not showing, he finally withdrew his men from their conspicuous position along the road. Thus, when the royal family finally did show, there was no escort.

[(23:24)](#!):

But that wasn’t the big problem. The big problem was that by using the slower-moving carriage and then suffering unexpected delays, once the Tuileries palace woke up and realized that the royal family had flown the coop, the messenger sent out from the city to spread the word overtook the family in no time.

[(23:44)](#!):

So when they passed through a town that had already been alerted to keep an eye out, the local postmaster recognized them. He was pretty sure that that governess was the queen because he had seen her once while serving in the cavalry. And that portly valet, well, he was probably the king. To make doubly sure, he pulled out an asignat from his pocket. The revolution’s currency bore a picture of Louis, and the king’s big prominent nose was a perfect match for the big prominent nose on that portly valet who just passed me by.

[(24:19)](#!):

So the postmaster hopped on his horse and sped off on a shortcut to the next town up the road, Varennes, just 30 miles from the border. The postmaster managed to beat the royal family to Varennes and convinced the local authorities to take a closer look at the Russian Baroness who was about to pass through. The authorities weren’t too impressed with the wild claims of the breathless postmaster, but he kept insisting and demanded at the very least the party be detained.

[(24:51)](#!):

So they were. Led into the home of a local official, an old servant who had once served at Versailles recognized Louis and instinctively dropped to one knee, to which Louis kind of carelessly tossed off, yes, I am your king. Which I mean, by this point, I’m sure he believed the jig was up, but dude, let the burden of proof stay with your accusers, you know? I mean, don’t confess just because some old man took a knee. So just like that, the flight to Montmedy became known to history as the flight to Varennes, which should more accurately be called the flight as far as Varennes, since it was never the intended destination.

[(25:31)](#!):

Meanwhile, back in Paris, the radical sections and the Jacobins both went crazy. They accused Lafayette, now their favorite whipping boy, of being incompetent or treacherous or both for letting the family escape. They further decided that the entire thing was a plot cooked up in concert with the Austrians, who would be invading any day now, and there were suddenly very real fears both inside Paris and out near the frontier that France was about to be invaded.

[(26:00)](#!):

The National Assembly sent orders straight away for the family to be brought back to Paris, then decreed that the king’s powers were provisionally suspended, that the borders were closed, and that they were now sitting in permanent session. The Jacobin Club soon followed suit and declared a similar permanent session. The royal family was then escorted back to the capital by some 6,000 armed men and women, mostly companies of national guard, but also just civilians who wanted to make sure the king and queen got home safe and sound.

[(26:33)](#!):

This was a fairly debilitating blow to the family’s morale because, locked up in Paris, they had just assumed that outside the capital they were as popular as ever. Indeed, everyone in on the plot assumed that even if the royal family was recognized on the road, that their loyal subjects wouldn’t turn them in. They were shocked to discover just how delighted everyone seemed to be that they had been caught. When they got back to Paris on June the 25th, they were met by crowds standing around in an eerie silence. There was no heckling or catcalling, just muted staring that I can only imagine was quite a bit more unsettling.

[(27:15)](#!):

The family was then deposited back in the Tuileries Palace, where they would remain under guard until the National Assembly decided what to do with them. Already, the Cordelier Club was drawing up a petition that declared liberty and royalty to be incompatible, and more than a few delegates in the National Assembly were starting to agree. But most of the others were not quite willing to take that particular plunge. And though they were furious with the king, they wanted to hedge their bets a bit. And they got General Debouillet, who had obviously hopped across the border after the family was arrested, induced him to accept responsibility for abducting the king, a transparent fiction made even more transparent because Louis had left behind a declaration to the French people justifying his escape and denouncing everything that had happened since the tennis court oath.

[(28:07)](#!):

But as republicanism started to pick up steam, this fiction about an abduction became necessary to ward off the super-radical populists. The flight to Varennes is in many ways a replay of Charles I’s flight from London in 1642. Remember all that business? In that case, Charles got away, he hoisted a banner, and started a civil war. What if he had been caught, though, and returned to Whitehall? Would the monarchy have collapsed right then and there? Or what if Louis had gotten away? Would he have hoisted a banner and started a French version of the English civil wars? It’s impossible to know for sure, because he did not get away.

[(28:51)](#!):

And all we do know is that the result of all this was the death of the monarchy’s legitimacy and an end to any cooperation whatsoever between the revolutionary leaders and the royal family. In the next phase of the action, some of those leaders will continue to try to keep the king at the center of the constitutional order, but with the radicals holding torches and pitchforks at the gate, and Louis himself purposefully now undermining their efforts, there is almost no chance of salvaging the situation.

[(29:21)](#!):

The flight to Varennes was thus a major turning point in the course of the French Revolution. And next time, we’ll get into the immediate aftermath of the failed flight, as the Cordel Yi Club will hold a mass demonstration on the Champs de Mars to demand an end to monarchy, a demonstration that will be suppressed by Lafayette, further estranging everyone from everyone else.

[(29:45)](#!):

Next week, however, is Thanksgiving here in the States, so it’ll be two weeks before we get into all of this. And I will see you then for the massacre of the Champs de Mars.

## The Flight of Emperor Palpatine

 [(00:01)](#!):

Last night, I accidentally loaded up a garbled version of episode 3.17 rather than 3.18. It was a few hours before I noticed the pile of emails alerting me that something had gone wrong. In the meantime, a group of dismayed listeners decided to take control of the comment thread on the episode and make up their own version of a story to pass the time. So here now is that story by listeners Jeremy, David, B. Minich, Steve SC, and Jim Silk, please to enjoy.

[(00:39)](#!):

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Temporary replacement to episode 3.18, The Flight of Emperor Palpatine.

[(00:56)](#!):

In June of 1791, Emperor Palpatine I fled the capital of Coruscant, family in tow. With the Jedi Council and the Senate firmly aligned in their opposition, Palpatine was friendless and forced to disguise his family as bilge droids to escape the planet. They hitched a ride aboard a Vogon destroyer, but as Vogons are notoriously unsympathetic to hitchhikers, when the stowaways were inevitably discovered, they found themselves promptly returned to Coruscant, and Palpatine had a lot of awkward questions to answer, like did I forget my towel again?

[(01:29)](#!):

At this point, Palpatine discovered that his options were very limited. He wasn’t very well liked, and had completely vacillated on the question of whether or not to allow clones into the very broken army. This, in turn, had turned the Vorlons against him, because they had a stake in who the clones claimed they were, which they could not prove if they were, you know, left on the sidelines. General Kenobi was looking like he was in a great position. As head of the army and leader of the revolutionary ideals, his party was ascendant, while Anakin Skywalker was on the outside looking in. Little did anyone know that in a year’s time, their relative positions would be completely different.

[(02:08)](#!):

By the time Palpatine got to Arrakis, the Spicing Guild was ready to go to the line with Rico’s Roughnecks against the Sardaukar. General Jack D. Ripper barked, take off and nuke the entire site from orbit, it’s the only way to be sure.

[(02:22)](#!):

Of course, now we run into a common problem that plagued the Empire in later years. Namely, some general would get a full head of steam, and his troops would declare him Augustus. When both Kenobi and Ripper were thus declared, it appeared for a moment as if Palpatine would simply be forgotten in the shuffle. But those pesky Vorlans, not content to simply let Palpatine off the hook, they leaked the whole story, along with incriminating documents and a few salacious limericks the Good Emperor had composed while whacked out on spice to the Daily Bugle, where Marat was editor-in-chief. The revolution, you’ll recall, had let the media off its leash.

[(02:59)](#!):

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Bonaparte nudges Private Duncan, asking, and the dialogue here is in French, so I just used Google to translate it verbatim. Bonaparte asks Private Duncan, you sleep on the job? This is baby, is it not? Duncan replies, yes, but the Apple Eye melody not B. Once the Marquis de Lafayette leaked the Pentagon Papers to Brenda Starr, the jig was up. The colonial defense forces showed up and kicked ass. Everyone got life in crematoria, or seppuku, their choice.

[(03:31)](#!):

The end.

Episode 3.19. The Massacre of the Champs de Mars.

[(02:08)](#!):

So last time, the royal family tried to break out of their de facto jail cell in the Tuileries palace, but were busted along the road and dragged ignobly back to Paris. The fate of the monarchy was suddenly on the tip of everyone’s tongue. Could it be saved? Would it be saved? Do we even want it to be saved?

[(02:27)](#!):

Now locked up in an even tighter de facto jail cell, the king and his family could only sit and wait and wonder what the verdict would be. And in those first weeks after the flight to Varennes, it was not at all inconceivable that those same mobs that had stormed the Bastille, marched on Versailles, halted the trip to Saint Clu, might finally shrug off whatever restraints had bound them and come looking for blood.

[(02:52)](#!):

But this nightmare specter did not just haunt the dreams of the royal family, if and when they managed any sleep. It also haunted the dreams of the respectable political center of the revolution, the liberal nobles, constitutional monarchists, civic-minded bourgeoisie who currently held sway in the National Assembly and in the government of the Paris Commune. For over a year now, these guys had been working to erect this enlightened constitutional monarchy, and now the king’s disastrous escape attempt was threatening to tear out the rock the new order was supposed to be built on. If they were going to salvage the situation, they were going to have to scramble fast to clamp down on any angry populist uprisings.

[(03:34)](#!):

Now as I mentioned when I was talking about the last days of Mirabeau, the revolutionaries were starting to drift into two camps, those who mostly feared an aristocratic-led counter-revolution and those who mostly feared lower-class-led anarchy. Today we’re going to talk about what the men in that latter camp did to protect themselves from the unwashed masses who threatened the civilized and enlightened new regime. We’ll also talk about the response of the leaders of those unwashed masses and how they now identified their primary political enemies not as the royal family or aristocratic emigres but rather that little clique of culotte-wearing active citizens who had hijacked the revolution for their own purposes, arrested its development, and were now running it for their own benefit and no one else’s.

[(04:21)](#!):

In the months and now years since the storming of the Bastille, these pseudo-revolutionaries running the National Assembly and the Paris Commune had been steadily erecting a wall to protect their new regime from attacks by the far-left radicals. And indeed, the coming massacre of the Champs de Mars has far more to do with this running conflict than the flight to Varenne itself. The king’s escape attempt was the final trigger that set the fatal showdown in motion, but the tinder was already well-stacked. At the heart of the conflict between the respectable bourgeoisie revolutionary politicians and the rabble-rousing populist leaders was the conduct of the Paris Commune’s new government.

[(05:02)](#!):

Recall that in the aftermath of the fall of the Bastille, the Paris electors, all educated men of property, had declared themselves in charge of the capital. They elected the eminent astronomer Jean-Sylvain Bailly as mayor and put the Marquis de Lafayette in charge of leading what would become the National Guard. From almost the minute he had been put into office, Bailly had been consolidating his power within Paris at the expense of the radical populists. The government of the Paris Commune under Bailly was elected by, and run by, men of active citizen rank who were terrified of the uncouth mobs. And so, by their own local decrees, and then working in concert with allies in the National Assembly, they did what they could to neutralize the masses. We’ve already seen how they tried to suppress the radical Cordelie district by literally redrawing the map of Paris. In the spring of 1791, this suppression picked up steam, collective petitioning was suddenly forbidden, and then a few weeks later the National Assembly passed a far-reaching ban on worker associations and declared labor strikes illegal. This was perfectly in keeping with the typical active citizen’s belief that individual liberty was at the very core of civic virtue. But still, to the leaders of the lower classes in Paris, the thrust of all this was clear. Bailly and his fancy-pants goons were trying to silence the people forever and simply replaced the old aristocracy of traditional nobility with a new aristocracy of wealthy bourgeoisie. What would change for the poor worker? Nothing. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

[(06:39)](#!):

By the time the king was making his run to Varennes, then, the leaders of lower class Paris had already concluded that Bailly and Lafayette were not representatives of the revolution but rather its arch-enemies. After the flight to Varennes, this conclusion would only be confirmed. So who were the leaders of lower class Paris? The people as they liked to style themselves. The guys I’m talking about here formed the inner circle of the Cordelie Club, which was founded in the wake of the Paris redistricting. Since these guys are about to move to the forefront of the story, I think it’s time to finally dig into them, introduce some new friends, and play catch-up with a few old friends we’ve already seen pop up in the story so far.

[(07:21)](#!):

And we must begin, and use as our framework for these introductions and catchings up, the life of the great giant of the revolution, Georges Danton. And that’s not some kind of metaphor. Danton was a head taller and twice as round as any other man in sight. You just couldn’t miss him. Georges Danton was born in the Champagne region east of France in 1759. When he was just a little kid, he survived a bout of smallpox and left his face pockmarked, and then he suffered not one but two kicks to the face from a bull. So as he grew, and grew, and grew, he was, by his own admission, a fairly ugly brute.

[(08:02)](#!):

Obviously a clever young lad, though. His mother sent him off to a nearby seminary when he was twelve. But after briefly enduring the tedious routine of the church, he came home from a break and more or less refused to go back. So his mother looked around and landed Danton in a school run by the Oratorians, a small little liberal Catholic order that embraced and taught most of the advanced Enlightenment thinking of the day. It was there that Danton first discovered the classical writers who would become his heroes, most especially Cicero. Now the thing that really set Danton apart at this point was that though he excelled at public speaking and had a memory like a steel trap, he was no good at writing, and he struggled to make sense of words on a page. If he heard a passage read out loud, he could instantly recite it back verbatim. But what he read just seemed to slip away. In short, Danton was probably dyslexic. His teachers, though, just chastised him for being lazy. And though that was no doubt unfair, Danton’s habit of skipping class to go swimming or play cards didn’t much help his case.

[(09:07)](#!):

When he graduated, the law seemed to be the surest path to a better life for an energetic provincial with a head on his shoulders, and he managed to talk his way into a job as a clerk in a Paris law firm in 1780, despite his atrocious writing samples.

[(09:22)](#!):

This was because Danton’s new boss turned out to be a pretty good judge of character. Realizing that the lad was no good for office work, he sent his new clerk down to the Palais Justus to observe court cases and report back everything he saw and heard. In this, Danton absolutely shined, and he displayed a remarkable ability to come back with a prescient and precise accounting of the day’s events. And with his massive frame, six feet at least now, with a huge barreled chest and a face that, well, let’s just say that Mrs. Revolutions hasn’t been too excited about the cover of the Danton biography that’s been lying around the house the last week or so. The point is, Danton was now a recognizable fixture of the Paris legal scene. After three years as a clerk, he went back home to pass the bar and then returned to his firm as a junior partner.

[(10:13)](#!):

As he plied his new trade, the sociable and boisterous Danton also made the after-hours rounds in the Paris cafes and wine bars. It was in this scene that he first met Camille Demoulas in 1787, and the two very quickly became friends, striking a somewhat ridiculous pair, Danton being this massive loudmouth and Demoulas being this slender, sensitive little writer. But they shared a passion for the old Greek and Roman masters, and were both positively bursting with energy to get out there and do something. Who knew what? But with the monarchy slipping into bankruptcy, it sure seemed like they would have a chance to do that something, and soon.

[(10:53)](#!):

Shortly after he fell in with Demoulas, Danton married and then purchased a position on the king’s council, a specialized and lucrative branch of the judicial system, the seller of the seat being an older gentleman who wanted to retire and who had just won the hand of a young heiress Danton had himself been courting for a while. The seat acted as a kind of consolation prize, and Danton was able to move his family over to the left bank, into the heart of the quarterly. During the next few years, he continued to earn a reputation as a dynamite public speaker, and with the political atmosphere charging up, he was known to give some of the finest impromptu street orations of the day.

[(11:33)](#!):

But when these states general were finally called, he had neither the time nor the resources to stand for election. He had borrowed heavily to purchase his seat on the king’s council, and just couldn’t afford to not keep working.

[(11:45)](#!):

Though he would not be a delegate, Danton was still interested in politics, and he began to fashion himself as a champion of the people, working always side by side with his friend Demoulas. And they made a great team. Danton could speak, but not write. Demoulas could write, but not really speak. Which is of course why it is one of history’s great ironies that when the deal went down in July 1789, it was Demoulas, not Danton, who wound up giving the speech that riled the Parisians up into armed insurrection.

[(12:16)](#!):

With Paris up in arms, Danton appointed himself captain of a self-declared militia unit, but pointedly managed to miss the assault on the Bastille, a missed opportunity that rankled him so badly that he actually led about 20 of his guys to the already stormed Bastille on July the 15th, and demanded the new governor let him in to inspect the premises. When the new governor refused to let anyone in, as were his orders from the Provisional Paris Commune, Danton hauled the guy out at gunpoint and marched him to the Hotel de Ville as a traitor to the people. But the guys running the Hotel de Ville didn’t have any idea what Danton thought he was doing, so they bawled him out for being a giant doofus and let the governor go with their apologies. But Danton knew exactly what he was doing. He was earning a little street cred for his new role as revolutionary leader of the Court of Guy district.

[(13:06)](#!):

From that point on, Danton was more or less at war with the leadership of the Paris Commune, and its new mayor Jean-Sylvain Bailly was his particular b\xc3\xaate noire. Danton was elected president of something called the Court of Guy Assembly, and they unilaterally announced that no decree of the Paris Commune would be enforceable unless the Court of Guy Assembly ratified it.

[(13:27)](#!):

With Danton doing the talking, D\xc3\xa9moulas started a successful weekly paper to push their shared agenda. This budding inner circle was soon joined by a long-struggling actor and dramatist named Fabre de Glantina, who had suddenly found his calling as inventor of a whole new genre of revolutionary theater that he believed would be as important to the overturning of the Asian regime as any direct political action. Joined by a few others I won’t bore you with, the little core that formed around Danton became the driving force of radical revolutionary politics in Paris.

[(14:03)](#!):

But for the moment, none of them were as well-known publicly as the crazy little hermit in their midst, Jean-Paul Marat, who was pumping his diatribes out of a basement in the Court of Guy so fast he practically invented the daily newspaper single-handedly. Danton didn’t care much for Marat \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, no one really did \xe2\x80\x94 but the force of Marat’s onslaught was undeniable, and Danton was happy enough to let Marat rail against Pailly and Lafayette and every other culotte-wearing faux-revolutionary who planned to crush the spirit of the people as completely as any aristocratic swine might try.

[(14:36)](#!):

When the central commune government had finally had enough of Marat and sent in bailiffs backed by 3,000 National Guardsmen to arrest him in January 1790, Danton was the one who openly defied them, and promised that he would raise 20,000 of his closest friends immediately if the bailiffs tried to take Marat out. While the authorities fretted, Marat managed to slip away, whereupon Danton stood down and invited the bailiffs to search wherever they pleased. This among many other affronts is what led Bailly to initiate the Paris redistricting that led the Court of Guy district to be subsumed into a larger section, hopefully smothering the populist movement with a pillow.

[(15:17)](#!):

But of course, the vigorous Court of Guy leadership simply took over the larger section. And when the first real elections for the Paris commune government were held in July 1790, Danton was a top vote-getter. But Bailly had apparently inserted some language into the election rules that the other sections had to confirm a delegate before they could be seated. Of the 600,000 people living in Paris, only 14,000 had the vote, and these middle-class lawyers and businessmen, men of letters, who now made up the Paris commune government, wanted no part of this ogre of the people. Danton was barred from taking his seat in the commune, and he bitterly returned to his unpaid position as head of the newly created Court of Guy club, where he could plot his revenge. To try to capture some political standing and make contact with key players in the National Assembly, Danton, Demoulet, and de Glatina joined the Jacobin Club in September 1790. One of the leading members of the Jacobins was of course Demoulet’s old friend from school, Maximilien Robespierre. Danton had met Robespierre before, and did not like the humorless little lawyer from Paris, who drank milk when everyone else drank wine. There was no doubt that his politics were sound, and his drive unrelenting.

[(16:34)](#!):

In January 1791, Danton was finally elected to an official position, when he got himself a seat on the governing board of the newly created Department of Paris, which was supposed to be above the Paris commune, but in all practical sense, the Paris commune was still independent. So, though the position came with little real power, it was nice to have a salary finally to help underwrite his revolutionary expenses.

[(16:58)](#!):

Around this time, he also started up a working relationship with the Compte de Mirabeau, who resembled Danton so much in style and in manner and especially in frame, and Danton absolutely admired and envied the public stature Mirabeau had built up for himself. But of course, Mirabeau died before the budding partnership went anywhere.

[(17:20)](#!):

So that pretty much catches us up with everything that went down last week. One last thing I need to mention is that through all of this, Danton was at heart a monarchist. To be anything else in that time and at that place was to indulge in unrealistic flights of fancy. And it was in fact one of the few political disagreements he had with Demoulin, who had been long advocating out-and-out republican principles. Now obviously, Danton’s vision for the monarchy included its benevolent protection of the lower classes. But until mid-1791, he never would have considered himself a republican.

[(17:55)](#!):

But as the rumors that the king was planning to escape began to swirl, Danton began to doubt whether Louis could ever be trusted to play things straight, and he was among the organizers of the mob that stopped the royal family from trying to go to Saint-Clu for Holy Week. Though in the aftermath of that confrontation, he reserved most of his wrath for Lafayette, who he told the Jacobin Club later that evening had been dying to fire into the crowd and was only stopped when the guardsmen refused the order. So Danton was teetering on a political brink when he woke up on the morning of June 21, 1791, and was told that the king had run off.

[(18:32)](#!):

The flight to Varennes pushed Danton over the brink and gave him a whole new purpose. Until now, he had been something of a revolutionary opportunist, using his charismatic persona to lead the people without really ever leading them anywhere. Now he had somewhere to lead them. France must be a republic. In response to the flight to Varennes, Danton quickly commissioned a petition from the Cordellie Club declaring monarchy and liberty incompatible.

[(19:04)](#!):

This was of course an inflammatory message, and doubly so because the medium itself was inflammatory, ignoring as it did the recent ban on mass petitioning, and activists circulating the petition were harassed by national guardsmen. And I need to talk about those guardsmen here for a second because though I’ve highlighted the two big times the national guard openly defied orders to move in against an angry crowd, that is during the Women’s March on Versailles and then when the royal family tried to go to Saint-Clu, that doesn’t mean they saw eye to eye with the people, just that there were sometimes lines they wouldn’t cross.

[(19:40)](#!):

Remember, by now not just officers but all rank and file members of the guard were of active citizen rank. They all had money, they had the vote, and they did not really identify much with all these dirty lowlifes. The Parisian National Guard actually spent most of their time policing the streets of Paris, arresting and locking up radical agitators for disturbing the peace or whatever other charges they felt like coming up with. So despite the couple of dramatic moments of insubordination, the national guard was, in the main, loyal to the government of the Paris Commune. Those three thousand guardsmen didn’t seem to have much problem marching down to try and arrest Marat for example.

[(20:20)](#!):

So all through this period, clashes between mouthy laborers on one side and haughty guardsmen on the other became fairly routine. These clashes started picking up over the spring of 1791 as the Paris Commune unveiled its new restrictions on mass mobilization. And then really started picking up after the king ran off and republicanism started spreading like wildfire in late June and early July 1791.

[(20:48)](#!):

As the second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille approached, and yes we are now at the second anniversary, the mood in Paris was very different from the first anniversary. A second feast of the federation was still planned, but it was on a considerably lower scale. The altar of the fatherland was re-erected, but there would be no glittering parades or solemn oaths or mass demonstrations of national solidarity. There was just too much bad blood going around for everyone to want to get down and party with men they neither liked nor trusted.

[(21:21)](#!):

Unfortunately for those of us who like to tell a good story, Don Hahn and his friends in the Court of Yee did not use the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille to launch a mass demonstration in favor of kicking Louis out of power. That would have been just too neat and tidy. Part of the reason for that is that by the time July the 14th came around, no one yet knew what the National Assembly had decided to do with the king.

[(21:47)](#!):

The leadership of the Court of Yee had made it clear they wanted a republic, but even the radicals in the Jacobin Club weren’t ready to bite at that apple quite yet. When Don Hahn thundered a call for a republic in the Jacobins one night, no less a radical than Robespierre silenced him with a curt, what is a republic? Translation, there is no such thing. We can put the king in a tiny, powerless box, but he cannot simply be gotten rid of. Not only would it be constitutionally unworkable, but it would probably invite all the monarchs of Europe to simultaneously invade.

[(22:23)](#!):

So it was not until July the 15th, probably intentionally waiting for the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille to come and go, that the National Assembly announced the result of its weeks of negotiations with the king. They officially concluded that Louis had not tried to escape, but had in fact been abducted, digging in on that transparent fiction that everyone knew was a transparent fiction. Further, they also declared that the king would still be the center of the constitution, inviolable, personally sacrosanct. There would be no republic.

[(22:58)](#!):

But that said, his provisional suspension from political activity would continue until the delegates finally put the finishing touches on what will become known as the Constitution of 1791, which we’re going to talk about next week. If Louis accepted the package without reservation, addendum, or amendment, all powers they had agreed to vest in him, and those powers were not purely ceremonial, would be his.

[(23:24)](#!):

All of this, of course, enraged Danton, Desmoulas, Marat, and the rest of the quarterly agitators. The fact that the king wouldn’t have to answer for his obvious attempt to slip out of France and probably then come back the head of a foreign army to attack his own people was an utterly contemptuous settlement, and that the constitution was going to entrench the distinction between active and passive citizens, permanently disenfranchising the mass majority of the French people so that men like Bailly and Lafayette, who now cared only about maintaining the status quo, could rule their little bourgeois kingdom as they saw fit, arresting honest workers whose only crime was exercising their right to free speech by criticizing the Paris Commune or telling the truth like the king had not been abducted, he had run for it.

[(24:09)](#!):

It was time for a mass demonstration to remind the Paris Commune and the National Assembly that just because they wanted to pretend like a half-million Parisians just didn’t exist didn’t mean a half-million Parisians didn’t exist.

[(24:24)](#!):

On the night of July 16th, it started going around that there was going to be a mass demonstration calling for the removal of Louis from power the next day at the Champs de Mars. This put the Paris Commune government on high alert, and Bailly agreed with Lafayette that the time had come to declare martial law. So when crowds started to gather at the Champs de Mars the late morning of July 17th, 1791, Lafayette and his guardsmen came down in a show of force, intimidating the mob and driving them off.

[(24:54)](#!):

But that would not be the end of that. Later in the day, the leaders of the Cordeliers regrouped. They managed to wrangle up a good 20,000 people, not the half-million they claimed to represent, but a good showing nonetheless, and they marched back down to the Champs de Mars.

[(25:10)](#!):

This crowd was more committed and better led than the early morning arrivals, and when they got to the great field, they posted their newly written petition on the still-standing altar of the Fatherland and invited everyone to come sign. The petition, written by Pierre Brussaux, I should probably note, began with a sequence of lines establishing the justice of their conclusion, which finally read, quote, that it would be as contrary to the majesty of the outraged nation as it would be contrary to its interests to confide the reigns of empire to a perjurer, a traitor, and a fugitive. We formally and specifically demand that the assembly receive the abdication made on 21 June by Louis XVI of the crown which had been delegated to him, and provide for his successor in the constitutional manner. And we declare that the undersigned will never recognize Louis XVI as their king unless the majority of the nation expresses a desire contrary to the present petition.

[(26:10)](#!):

Now this obviously falls short of out-and-out calling for a republic, but it clearly said that Louis was done unless a majority of the nation decides otherwise, and not some little clique of active voters, mind you, the whole nation. About 6,000 had signed the petition when Lafayette and his National Guard moved back in to halt the rally. Lafayette announced that Paris was under martial law and that everyone was to immediately disperse. This, however, was greeted by jeering insults and then by flying rocks. The Guard fired off a few warning shots, but the crowd was unmoved.

[(26:48)](#!):

With the projectiles still reigning in, discipline in the National Guard ranks broke, and they started firing into the crowd. No order to fire was ever given, and Lafayette scrambled to restore order and stop the shooting, but the damage was already done. There are conflicting reports, but when the field finally cleared out, something like twenty to fifty Parisians lay dead. The radical press, led of course by Marat, immediately denounced the massacre at the Champs-de-Mars and called for Lafayette’s head.

[(27:20)](#!):

And in the end, the reputation of Lafayette, already sinking fast, would never really be salvaged. And when Jean Sylvain Bailly was hauled out of retirement and led to the guillotine in November of 1793, it would be for his role in ordering the massacre that he was convicted. They even moved the guillotine to the Champs-de-Mars so they could kill him on the spot where he had allegedly betrayed the revolution.

[(27:45)](#!):

For the moment, however, it was the radical leaders who had the most of fear, and the inner circle of the Cordelie Club dispersed and agreed to keep their heads down for a little bit. Danton, for example, thought this might be a fine time to go visit England for a little bit, and he managed to slip away before the authorities could catch up with him.

[(28:04)](#!):

The other immediate effect of the massacre was to tear the Jacobin Club in two. And next week, that little engine of the revolution will once again bear the brunt of a mass walkout, as those truly committed to the monarchy will decide that they had to sever all ties to their more radical colleagues, who seemed to be coming around to the idea that monarchy and liberty were in fact incompatible. And next week, these committed monarchists will desert from the Jacobins in droves, go off to found a new club led by that triumvirate of Barnab, Dupour, and Lema\xc3\xaet, and it would be left to them to defend the Constitution of 1791, a defense that they would ultimately fail at, as distrust for Louis and his family only grew, and then the European powers made it all worse by making noise that maybe they were interested in armed intervention after all. I want to end this week by teasing something that I’m pretty excited about, and I hope you will be too. When I got going on the French Revolution, I mentioned that I was going to have to get a little bit more serious about the money thing. And so, next week, for the first time in the seven odd years I’ve been podcasting, I’m going to launch a dedicated fundraising drive.

[(29:18)](#!):

To drive this drive, I also for the first time in the seven odd years I’ve been podcasting, finally have some merchandise to offer as a little reward for your support. That Gentleman Johnny’s Party Train t-shirt? It exists, and for a limited time, you will be able to buy it. There’s going to be a bunch of other cool stuff, including a Livia Did It shirt, for those of you who have been bugging me about that since the History of Rome days, and even a brand new audio book, for those of you who’d like to see what happens when I try my hand at fiction.

[(29:48)](#!):

I’ll get into all the details next week, but just know that this is going to be a limited time thing. So this is the moment when you should support the show, because you’ll get to pick up some really cool stuff along the way, and then, hopefully, keep me chained to my desk for at least another year.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.20 The Constitution of 1791 In the wake of the massacre at the Champs de Mars, it very much appeared that the Republican movement had been permanently suppressed. The radical leaders of the radical Paris districts were in hiding, and everyone else was busy putting the finishing touches on the Constitution of 1791, a constitution that would establish France permanently as a constitutional monarchy. And it nearly was permanent, which is to say, it almost lasted a whole year.

[(02:40)](#!):

But in the late summer of 1791, it definitely looked like the revolution was winding down, especially because the triumvirate of Antoine Barnhove, Adrien Dupour, and Alexandre Lema\xc3\xaet had stepped forward in the wake of the flight to Varennes, seized the political initiative, and were carefully guiding both the King and the National Assembly towards the peaceful and reasonable shores of constitutional monarchy. So I want to begin today by talking a little bit about the triumvirate and the new political club they founded to defend these peaceful and reasonable shores, then pull back to take in the broader international implications of the flight to Varennes, and then circle back in to inaugurate the Constitution of 1791, and finally bid a fond farewell to the National Assembly.

[(03:27)](#!):

So the oldest of the triumvirs was our old friend Adrien Dupour, but born in 1759, he was still only 32 years old in the summer of 1791. Now I don’t need to rehash his life too much, since we already saw him lead the old parliament in battle against the royal ministry, and then organize the liberal nobles into that influential society of 30 in the months leading up to the Estates General.

[(03:51)](#!):

Once elected to that body, Dupour was happy to abandon his seat in the second estate and go join the National Assembly, where his eloquence, his reputation, and his keen intellect made him something of a go-to authority for all things judicial. And he guided the reorganization of the judicial system that accompanied the great departmental reorganization of France.

[(04:12)](#!):

But though he had been ahead of the revolutionary curve for years, he was a staunch monarchist, and after the flight to Varennes he worked tirelessly to save the monarchy from destruction. More than anyone else, it was Dupour who concocted and maintained that transparent fiction that the king had been abducted. Dupour was a leading member of a committee that interviewed the king after the flight, and he skillfully deflected awkward questions and prevented anyone else from making outright accusations against the king. Then, Dupour managed to convince the National Assembly that admitting the truth publicly would lead to anarchy, and the bloody clash on the Champs de Mars seemed to support that claim. A year younger than Dupour was Alexandre Lema\xc3\xaetre. Born in 1760 and now 31 years old, Alexandre Lema\xc3\xaetre was actually one of three prominent Lema\xc3\xaetre brothers. All three were career army officers, and all three would be elected to the Estates General. Both Alexandre and his brother Charles served under Rochambeau in the American War of Independence, and not surprisingly, Alexandre and Charles both wound up forward-thinking liberals, while their eldest brother, whose name I won’t trouble you with, remained a conservative.

[(05:27)](#!):

Alexandre was a member of Dupour’s Society of Thirty, and after the Estates General were called, he was an early noble defector over to the National Assembly, and then played a prominent role in the night of August the 4th, happily stepping forward to renounce privileges he had never put much stock in anyway. He helped found the Jacobins, and remained a prominent left-wing voice right into early 1791, and was actually one of the Jacobin leaders who denounced Mirabeau for the great orator’s defense of the royal family, especially since it seemed to coincide with the sudden disappearance of all Mirabeau’s debts.

[(06:03)](#!):

But like Dupour, and then as we’ll see in a minute with Barnoff, the sustained popular assault on the monarchy was making him nervous, and he was definitely in the revolutionary camp that feared radical mobs more than reactionary aristocrats. For Lema\xc3\xaet, the revolution as such was now pretty much over. It was time to inaugurate the new constitution, and enjoy the fruits of all their labor.

[(06:28)](#!):

The youngest of the Triumvirs was Antoine Barnoff. Born in October 1761, he was still only 29 years old in the summer of 1791. But unlike Dupour and Lema\xc3\xaet, Barnoff was a commoner, and more than that, he was a Protestant. He hailed from Grenoble, and was deeply involved with Meunier’s movement to convene the Dauphin\xc3\xa9 Estates and defend the Grenoble Parliament from being sent into exile. He wrote a hugely influential pamphlet in response to the May edicts called The Spirit of the Edicts, which gave him a bit of national prominence going into the Estates General. He was a third estate delegate from Dauphin\xc3\xa9, and though he and Meunier were personal friends and long-standing political allies, they drifted apart once the sweep of events got a hold of them. You’ll maybe remember that in the negotiations over the King’s veto that we talked about back in episode 3.13, that was when Lafayette got everyone together at Thomas Jefferson’s house, Lafayette was hoping the friendship between Barnoff and Meunier would lead to a compromise. But Meunier proved to be a stick in the mud.

[(07:32)](#!):

Of the three Triumvirs, Barnoff’s turn towards conservatism in 1791 comes with the most compelling personal story. He was one of the three delegates appointed by the National Assembly to go escort the royal family back from Varennes. By all accounts, it was on the return trip that Barnoff would begin to feel a deep sympathy for the royal family, especially for the children, and then doubly especially for Queen Marie-Antoinette. Upon his return, Barnoff would take up a secret correspondence with the Queen, and do everything in his power during the closing weeks of the National Assembly to preserve and even extend the power of the royal family.

[(08:12)](#!):

So the triumvirate of Barnoff, Lema\xc3\xaetre, and Dupour represents a certain type of revolutionary. They were all educated, well-to-do liberals. They had been early leaders in the fight, passionately committed to Enlightenment rationality and the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

[(08:30)](#!):

For them, the Constitution of 1791 was supposed to be the crowning achievement of the whole revolution, the final settlement everything had been building towards. With its completion in sight, they dug in and fought as hard to keep France from falling into the hands of crazy radicals as they had fought to wrench it out of the hands of pig-headed conservatives. Of course, when the Constitution of 1791 turned out to be a spectacular failure, and France did fall into the hands of the crazy radicals, well, I guess we’ll just have to see what happens to the triumvirate then.

[(09:04)](#!):

But for now, they were still riding high, and the sensible, practical, dependable delegates of the National Assembly rallied around them after the flight to Varennes, and then especially after the massacre of the Champs de Mars. The first order of business for the triumvirate was to make a clean break from the Jacobin Club. All three of our triumvirs had been founding members, and though they had not followed Lafayette out when the society of 1789 started up, they were not at all impressed with the persistent, unrelenting, and freakishly virtuous drive of Robespierre and his radical followers, and they knew for a fact that a lot of other Jacobins felt the same way.

[(09:43)](#!):

So in the wake of the Champs de Mars, the triumvirate staged a mass walkout to go form a new political club that would better represent their beliefs. Most of the prominent and influential members of the Jacobins went with them, leaving Robespierre presiding over an inferior rump that for the moment was not completely off balance. But of course, Robespierre simply used the walkout as an opportunity to streamline Jacobin ideology and solidify his own personal influence within the club, so that when the time came, the Jacobins would come back stronger and deadlier than ever.

[(10:20)](#!):

To replace the Jacobins, the triumvirate formed a new club called the Fouya, which hopefully I’m getting that right because it looks like Foul-ya-nce. Anyway, the Fouya were at their core a club for constitutional monarchists. Their admission rates were jacked up to reflect their more elitist leanings, and they were soon joined by old members of the society of 1789, who had grown weary of the reactionary reputation their old club had garnered. And this, by the way, basically marks the end of the line for the society of 1789.

[(10:53)](#!):

Now in a vacuum, it looked like the Fouya would be the ascendant agenda-setting party for the foreseeable future, and as soon as they got organized, they sent out a flurry of communiques to Jacobin clubs out in the provinces, urging them to switch their affiliation to the Fouya. The triumvirate planned to occupy a new political center of constitutional monarchism, and from there control national politics.

[(11:18)](#!):

But as it would turn out, they were just about the only ones who had any interest in the center. Though it was not apparent on the surface, the gravity of French politics was not coalescing in the center, but rather on the extreme edges of right and left. Only about 70 of the now hundreds of affiliated Jacobin clubs responded positively to Fouya overtures, and most of those eventually drifted back to the orbit of Robespierre.

[(11:46)](#!):

But for the moment, the triumvirate still controlled the levers of power, and they knew how to use them. In late July, they pushed through decrees that political clubs had to register with the municipal police, and that anyone who incited pillage, arson, or civil disobedience were subject to arrest. And then on August the 23rd came a biggie restricting freedom of the press, strengthening libel laws, and forbidding anyone from advocating disobedience or defiance to public authorities.

[(12:17)](#!):

Now this was all in direct response to the illegal demonstration and or massacre of the Champs de Mars, but added to the already existing bans on mass petitioning and worker strikes, it is clear that the delegates of the National Assembly had had quite enough of democratic street politics, thank you very much. Then in a fairly naked bit of cynical PR, the triumvirate announced that they were dropping the minimum property requirements for delegates to the new legislative assembly. Those requirements had been an easy target for popular agitators to aim at, so removing them left those agitators with at least one less leg to stand on.

[(12:57)](#!):

Except then you read the fine print, and you see that they were simultaneously raising property requirements for all the electors. So when elections to the new legislative assembly started up at the end of August, there were no formal restrictions on who could serve as a delegate, but good luck ever getting elected Mr. Firebrand Populist Man.

[(13:19)](#!):

On the eve of the shuttering of the National Assembly, the Fouya also promulgated one last little decree designed to clamp down on potentially seditious political clubs, like the Jacobins or the Kortelje. The decree said that political clubs had no legal rights as such, not even the right to exist. They were no longer allowed to petition the government, or send out organized delegations, or really interact with public affairs in any coordinated way.

[(13:47)](#!):

But this last decree would never really be enforced, and in passing at the Fouya helped sow the seeds of their own destruction. They themselves would adhere to the spirit of the law, and scrupulously turn the Fouya from a political organ into a mere social club. Robespierre and the Jacobins, meanwhile, ignored the law and organized furiously, and you can imagine who would be better prepared to dictate the course of politics in the months to come.

[(14:16)](#!):

So pivoting away from domestic affairs to foreign affairs, one of the big reasons that political power was not concentrating in the center was because of another direct consequence of the flight to Varennes. Everyone was convinced that at any moment the European powers were going to invade and France would be at war. And with that invasion looming, this was no time to get squishy.

[(14:41)](#!):

Everyone from the most conservative conservative to the most radical radical believed that the flight to Varennes had been about getting the royal family linked up with the Austrians so they could come storming back in to either save the day, so said the conservatives, or ruin everything, so said the radicals. And everyone was doubly eager, or nervous, because in the weeks and months after the flight to Varennes the French army was basically paralyzed.

[(15:07)](#!):

Officers directly complicit in the flight, like General Debouillet, wasted no time beating a path out of town. But their emigration seemed to be everyone else’s cue to split too. By the end of 1791, something like 60% of the French officer corps had abandoned their posts and emigrated out of the country. And this was a catastrophe. I mean whatever you thought about the military aristocracy and where their true loyalties lay, just outright losing over half your senior officer corps overnight is an unmitigated disaster in terms of military readiness. If France was attacked, how in the world would the French army be able to fight back? It had no head. But was France about to be attacked in the summer of 1791?

[(15:53)](#!):

Short answer? No. Not even a little bit. When last we left the major European powers, they had just gotten together and signed the Treaty of Reichenbach in July 1790 that settled a lot of tension in Western Europe. The impetus for the treaty had been the threat of yet another war between the expansionist Prussians, now led by King Frederick William II, and their old enemy Austria, led now by Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II.

[(16:24)](#!):

The Treaty of Reichenbach swiped some territory around and successfully averted another war between the two German powers. But the big upshot of Reichenbach was to begin an estrangement between Prussia and Great Britain, who had been allies since the diplomatic revolution of 1765.

[(16:42)](#!):

In a nutshell, Britain’s foreign policy goal was to maintain the status quo balance of power on the continent, and Prussia’s foreign policy goal was to upset that balance of power and gobble up as much territory as they possibly could. At Reichenbach, the British had worked behind the scenes to stymie the ambitions of their nominal ally, and the Prussians were forced to accept terms that did not satisfy the ambitions of their king one bit.

[(17:08)](#!):

So in the aftermath of the British betrayal at Reichenbach, the Prussians started pitching the Austrians on the benefits of cooperation rather than competition. Both were now being bombarded by pleas from the French emigres to do something about the damned revolutionary dogs, and Prussia wondered aloud if maybe they shouldn’t do something.

[(17:27)](#!):

But Leopold and his advisers saw no great upside to getting involved in French affairs, especially since Prussia was clearly only in it for the possibility of gobbling up French territory. Plus, as it turns out, Leopold was actually something of an enlightened constitutionalist himself. Far from being horrified by events in France, he was in fact quite in agreement with the basic aims of the revolutionaries. He had some sympathy for his sister, Marie Antoinette, though he had not seen her in twenty-five years. His big takeaway from the fall of the Bastille was, well, that’s what you get when you refuse to listen to your people decade in and decade out.

[(18:06)](#!):

Leopold himself was following in the footsteps of his late older brother Joseph II, and was trying to bring the Holy Roman Empire into the modern age from the top down rather than letting it boil from the bottom up. So Austria basically ignored the pleas of the emigres and told the Prussians they would take no action against the French.

[(18:25)](#!):

Now that’s not to say there wasn’t some troubling stuff coming out of France, as the case was in October 1790 when the National Assembly announced that treaties negotiated between princes did not bind nations, which was basically a unilateral repudiation of all French treaties, just that for the moment the French were in no position to enforce their universal visions. And already bogged down fighting the Turks and the Balkans, the Austrians had no interest opening up a whole new military front.

[(18:56)](#!):

But Prussia couldn’t take action against France alone. So King Frederick William II decided to brush aside the emigres with a small loan, and then he turned his lust for territorial expansion eastward toward Poland, which also had the benefit of being a project the British would likely support. Because in the East, Prussian and British interests seemed to align. The Russians were in the process of whipping the Turks, which upset the British desire for everyone to please just stay in their assigned seats. Working in concert with a reformist government in Poland that wanted out from under Russian hegemony, Britain and Prussia began to devise an operation to dislodge Poland from the Russian orbit.

[(19:37)](#!):

Prussia, eyeing liberated Poland as a new protectorate it could dominate, Britain just happy to check the advancing power of Catherine the Great. So as everyone moved into 1791, there was indeed a war looming in Europe, but it was probably going to be fought by the British and Prussians against the Russians. But just as Prussia was mobilizing for an Eastern campaign in March 1791, their allies in Britain once again left them hanging out to dry. For a variety of reasons \xe2\x80\x93 military reality, domestic politics, and apparently some of the greatest Russian diplomacy of all time \xe2\x80\x93 the British backed out of the campaign at the last minute.

[(20:19)](#!):

This left Prussia absolutely furious and desperate to move in any diplomatic direction that would get them out from under the untrustworthy British. So the alliance system that had been built in 1765 was now officially falling apart. Absolutely livid with the British, the Prussians then went back to courting the Austrians. Now the Austrians had already declined to join the campaign in Poland, as there was no earthly reason for them to upset their alliance with Russia. But then came a little break. In May 1791, the reformers in Poland promulgated their own Enlightenment-influenced constitution, and attempted to assert independence from Russia.

[(21:00)](#!):

Now I am not versed enough in domestic Polish politics to explain this little revolution, but on an international level, it helped put the Austrians on the same side as the Prussians. Austria liked the idea of an independent Poland, serving as a buffer between them and Russia. But they didn’t want to upset their alliance with the Russians, and still bogged down in the Balkans, they didn’t have the resources to support the Poles militarily. But the Prussians did. And it was the question of how to handle the situation in Poland, not how to handle the situation in France, that led Frederick William and Leopold to meet in Pilnitz in August 1791.

[(21:40)](#!):

So here we are now, a good two years into the French Revolution, and not only is France not a central concern of any of the European powers, it’s barely on anyone’s radar. Aside from the irritating matter about what to do with the French \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, and whether or not to comment on the struggle between France and the Vatican over papal lands inside the French frontier, Revolutionary France was something worth observing from afar with a certain amount of satisfying schadenfreude, not something you actually wanted to get involved in. And that’s when the flight to Varennes came along and finally put France on the radar screen of the great powers.

[(22:15)](#!):

When Leopold II briefly believed that the escape attempt had succeeded, he indicated in a letter that he was now willing to support the royal family with men, money, and guns. But then when he learned that the escape had in fact failed, he returned to his policy of scrupulous inaction. Though he did now kind of feel like he should at least say something about the plight of the royal family, if only to satisfy his sister’s honor. So he issued a document called the Padua Circular in early July 1791, which called on his fellow monarchs to work in concert to restore the liberty of the royal family.

[(22:52)](#!):

But as expected, only Prussia signaled any interest in such a project, desperate as they were to secure an alliance with Austria that would a.) get them out from under the British and b.) point them in the direction of some new territory. So in August 1791, when Frederick William and Leopold met at Pillnitz to discuss the situation in Poland, a situation that was about to get interesting as the war between Russia and Turkey was winding down and Catherine was about to turn her attention back to her rebellious satellite, the two leaders carved out some time to draft the now-famous Declaration of Pillnitz.

[(23:30)](#!):

On the surface, the Declaration could not have been more blunt. It said that if the revolutionaries further threatened the safety of the royal family, that Austria and Prussia would declare war and invade. I mean, what could be clearer? But Leopold inserted a really important clause that put lie to the surface meaning. That clause said only if all the other European powers cooperated in the operation would Austria and Prussia invade France. And of course, the other European powers hadn’t cooperated on anything in their lives.

[(24:03)](#!):

The Declaration of Pillnitz was a meaningless piece of paper. I mean, at that very moment, Leopold was taking the opportunity presented by the end of the war with the Turks to demobilize something like 25,000 men. And that’s just not something you do if you’re serious about invading France. To put it bluntly, Austria had no intention of ever going to war with revolutionary France.

[(24:28)](#!):

But less than a year later, they were at war with revolutionary France. And we’ll get into all the particulars in the episodes to come. But I want to end this survey of the international scene by pointing out one fatal misunderstanding shared by both the Prussians and the Austrians. Having issued the Padua Circular and the Declaration of Pillnitz, they turned to observe the effects these threats had on French domestic politics. And the effects, to them, couldn’t be more clear.

[(24:55)](#!):

Obviously afraid of being invaded, the French political classes elevated the moderate fouya to power, suppressed radical republicans, and inaugurated the Constitution of 1791. Which promised to leave France stable enough to not collapse into anarchy, but not strong enough to threaten the other powers. Which is exactly what the other European powers wanted. But the Austrian and Prussian threats of war had nothing whatsoever to do with the rise of the fouya. And in point of fact, Austrian saber rattling would help topple the fouya, and lead directly to the war they never wanted any part of, and a war that would then proceed to last for a generation.

[(25:37)](#!):

So I want to end today by circling back around to French domestic politics, and finally close the books on the National Assembly. It had begun its life as the Estates General in May 1789, and was supposed to meet for a few months and then go home. Instead, it quickly morphed into the National Assembly, and then morphed again into the National Constituent Assembly. Their objective morphed along with it, from finding a solution to the immediate financial crisis, to crafting from scratch a written constitution for France.

[(26:08)](#!):

But events had forced them to become both a legislative body and a constitutional convention at the same time, and so their work was slow, and the results tangled. The National Assembly had decreed all kinds of stuff, but it was hard to tell which decrees were meant to be embedded in the constitution, and which were simply run-of-the-mill laws.

[(26:29)](#!):

A committee of revisions had been set up back in September 1790 to help sift through the piles, and wouldn’t you know it, Barnab, Dupour, and Charles Lemet were all on it. And so, when the National Assembly started winding down a year later, the ascendant triumvirate were positioned perfectly to decide what was in and what was out of the new constitution. So much so that the Lemets actually tried to revive Meunier’s old program with its two-chambered legislative body, an absolute veto for the king, and delegates allowed to serve as royal ministers. But the momentum of what had already been settled was too strong to overcome.

[(27:08)](#!):

Barnab worked tirelessly to ensure that the king would maintain as many prerogatives as possible, that he would be able to appoint his own ministers and ambassadors and high-level army officers, and that the annual royal stipend would be enough to befit the dignity of the royal family.

[(27:26)](#!):

The constitution that emerged in September 1791, then, was mostly composed of all those little pieces we’ve already talked about. A legislative branch composed of a single house, to be called the Legislative Assembly. An executive branch composed of the king and his ministry, with a suspenseive veto and the right to conduct day-to-day foreign policy and day-to-day military operations, but without the right to unilaterally declare war and peace. And then a streamlined and rationalized judicial branch housed within the new departmental administrative system.

[(28:00)](#!):

The Declaration of the Rights of Man served as a preamble, to be followed by 210 separate articles outlining in detail the new constitutional monarchy that would hopefully govern France in perpetuity. In a move to help bolster support for the new constitution, the Triumvirate ensured that the extraordinarily controversial civil constitution of the clergy was not inserted directly into the text of the constitution. It would remain a thing apart. Mostly, this was to ensure that conservative Catholics could swear to uphold the constitution without sacrificing their religious principles.

[(28:39)](#!):

On September 3, 1791, the National Assembly presented the constitution to Louis, and ten days later, over the vehement protests of his \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 brothers, he signaled his assent. On September 30, the National Assembly met for the final time.

[(28:56)](#!):

It had been in session for thirty remarkable months. In a rush of events so fast they could barely catch their breath, they had completely upended the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime. They had begun \xe2\x80\x93 most of them, anyway \xe2\x80\x93 as political neophytes, and emerged seasoned, if not utterly exhausted, politicians. They had unilaterally declared themselves the sovereign representative body of the nation, abolished feudalism \xe2\x80\x93 with a few caveats \xe2\x80\x93 completely reorganized the administration of the entire country, and along the way sent into the dustbin of history institutions and abuses that had plagued France for centuries. No more venal offices, no more lechres d’\xc3\xa9cach\xc3\xa9, no more hated salt tax, no more forced labor, no more feudal dues or internal customs, or seventy-eight different special courts, none of which seemed interested in justice.

[(29:49)](#!):

And after years of work, they had finally crafted the first written constitution in the history of France. Sure, there had been an explosive crisis or two along the way, but they had weathered the storm, and France was now a better place than they had found it, and it was time for them to lay down their burden, all of them, at the same time. Which, in retrospect, was a really bad idea.

[(30:15)](#!):

What am I talking about? Well, back in May 1791, Ropes-Pierre wound up making his first really great contribution to the course of the Revolution. It seemed a minor point at the time, one that would simply signal that the delegates of the National Assembly were virtuous citizens interested in the welfare of France, not the permanent acquisition of power. So the incorruptible Ropes-Pierre had gotten up and convinced his fellow delegates to sign off on a self-denying decree. That is, delegates in the National Assembly would be barred from sitting in the first session of the new Legislative Assembly.

[(30:54)](#!):

The effect of this little declaration of disinterested statesmanship was to ensure that not one single man who had had a hand in crafting the new constitution would be there to defend it when it came under attack. It also meant that every man who had been prominent enough, respected enough, educated enough, wealthy enough, to get elected to the first sitting of the Estates General in 175 years \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, we’re talking about the cream of the crop \xe2\x80\x93 these guys were all now on the sideline.

[(31:24)](#!):

And who would replace them? Well, a lot of guys who had not been prominent or wealthy or respected enough to get elected to the Estates General, but who had learned in the streets and in the political clubs a whole new brand of revolutionary politics. And next week, we will see what happens when those guys get into power, and you better believe that the French Revolution is about to take a giant lurch to the left.

[(31:51)](#!):

I’ll close out today with two brief announcements. First, just so you’re prepared for it, I’ll be back with an episode next week, but after that, Saturnalia is upon us once again, and family obligations are going to keep me away from the show for two weeks. If I can carve out some time, I hope to have a little present for you, but no promises.

So this week, I just want to say that I finished A Tale of Two Cities, and it was absolutely fantastic, and I’d like to double up on my recommendation. Many of the events that we’ve talked about so far in the show are brilliantly dramatized. The Fall of the Bastille, the Chaos of the Great Fear, and then, of course, the looming Reign of Terror. Now, Dickens was writing with Thomas Carlyle’s rather odd poem history of the French Revolution opened in his lap, so some of it can be more melodramatic than is strictly accurate. But still, man, what a fantastic book. I’ll never be able to look at women sitting and knitting the same way again.

[(02:36)](#!):

Okay, on with the show. After the National Assembly closed its doors on September the 30th, 1791, French revolutionary politics took zero days off. Because the next morning, October the 1st, 1791, the new legislative assembly convened for the first time. Elections for the assembly had started up at the end of August and run through September on the assumption that the constitution of 1791 was about to be completed, and the king would accept it. Then it was, and he did, so a new slate of elected representatives from the various departments and municipalities of France were already in Paris, ready to hit the ground running on October the 1st.

[(03:18)](#!):

The legislative assembly, as I mentioned at the end of last week’s episode, was composed of an entirely new cohort of political leaders. Robespierre’s self-denying decree prevented National Assembly delegates from standing for election. But it wasn’t just that the members were literally different men. It was also that they were a different kind of men.

[(03:38)](#!):

The most obvious difference between the two assemblies was that almost no clerics or nobles stood for election. And when I say nobles, I mean men who had formerly been noble, since technically their titles had now been set aside. Those guys had constituted half the membership of the National Assembly. Now they were nowhere to be seen. Of the 745 delegates to the legislative assembly, only a handful were drawn from the ranks of the old first and second estates.

[(04:08)](#!):

Another big difference is that most of the legislative assembly delegates had spent the last two and a half years of the revolution living and working in the districts they now represented. Why is that important? Well, because the National Assembly delegates had spent that same two and a half years living and working in Versailles and Paris.

[(04:27)](#!):

I mean, sure, some of them went home from time to time, but for the most part, they were working in a bubble, passing these enormous reforms and then lobbing them out into the countryside where locals had to pick their way through it all. The guys who were elected to the legislative assembly were those locals who had been picking their way through the reforms on the ground. They were also the ones who had to deal with daily resistance to those reforms, which the National Assembly only heard about by way of secondhand reports if they heard about it at all. So the revolution was not an abstract matter of principle to the men of the legislative assembly. It was a real, tangible thing that they had been working on for years now, and it was very much in need of a firm defense.

[(05:09)](#!):

So while the outgoing National Assembly delegates had a tendency to look down on the incoming legislative assembly delegates, dismissing them as a bunch of young, obscure, and inexperienced rustics, that was only because the National Assembly delegates had kind of lost touch with what was going on back home. The incoming delegates may have been a bit younger statistically, but obscure and inexperienced? Not anymore.

[(05:34)](#!):

Nearly every one of them had more than two years of practical experience in revolutionary politics and had become quite well known, at least in their home departments. Many had been officers in the National Guard or served in local government after that little municipal revolution swept through the provinces after the fall of the Bastille. Then the Departmental Reorganization of France had created all manner of new administrative posts that had to be filled, to say nothing of the provincial Jacobin clubs that began sprouting up all over the place where ambitious locals could meet and mingle and get to know each other. These guys were waist deep in the revolution in a way that the members of the National Assembly simply could not understand.

[(06:17)](#!):

Now aside from serving in local government, there was also one other way to pick up practical political experience and earn reputation enough to get elected to the Legislative Assembly. And that was by not serving in local government, but instead by being a fierce and vocal critic of local government.

[(06:34)](#!):

So the Legislative Assembly came with a whole bunch of guys who had made their bones not applauding the new order, but by harping on all the ways it fell short of perfection. And since conservatism was dormant for the moment, these attacks invariably came from the left. The revolution must go faster, it must go further, it must go higher. Send me to the Legislative Assembly and owe the heights to which we’ll soar.

[(07:01)](#!):

But all that said, when the Legislative Assembly delegates began arriving in Paris, it appeared that the Fouya Club, led by the Triumvirate, would maintain their ascendant edge through the transition period. The electorate was, remember, composed of well-to-do active citizens. And on top of that, only about 10% bothered to vote. And that’s not 10% of the total population, that’s 10% of the already miniscule active citizen electoral rolls. So the men being elected, and doing the electing, were drawn from the ranks of France’s social and economic upper-middle crust. So mostly well-off property owners, or, as always, lawyers.

[(07:42)](#!):

So though the Legislative Assembly came in collectively leaning further to the left than the departing National Assembly, there were still a lot of delegates with a vested interest in solidifying the new order. So when the newly minted delegates arrived in Paris and went looking for a political club to join, only about 130 went straight for the Jacobins. Meanwhile, somewhere between 250 and 350 joined the Fouya, indicating that at the outset at least, opinion ran in the direction of making the Constitution of 1791 work.

[(08:15)](#!):

But also worth noting is that the remaining 300 to 400 delegates joined no club at all, and it was this persuadable middle over which the coming political battles would be fought and then decisively won by the Jacobins. Now there were a couple of big reasons the Fouya are going to run out of gas so quickly. First, their core leadership, built around Barnab, Dupour, and Lema\xc3\xaetre, were now out of power. Barred from the Legislative Assembly, and further barred by another National Assembly decree from serving in the Royal Ministry, they could now only influence policy informally.

[(08:53)](#!):

Second, and this one hit Barnab especially hard, the Fouya leadership had believed that the royal family would love them for saving the monarchy from radical republicans, when in fact they were now despised by the conservatives at court for salvaging the dishonorable settlement represented by the Constitution of 1791. These conservatives did their best to undermine the Fouya, often by cynically giving aid to the radicals in the hopes that the whole revolutionary project would fall apart.

[(09:22)](#!):

Finally, as I mentioned at the end of last week, the Fouya were deliberately depoliticizing their club. Subscription rates were high, the public was barred from its meetings, they did not plot concrete legislative strategy. So if you were an energetic and ambitious politician, the Fouya Club was no place for you. The action, as everyone knew, was down in the Jacobin Club, where nightly the House was brought down by the best speakers, the most charismatic leaders, who were debating the most important issues of the day. By December, the Fouya would be in terminal decline. But they were able to score one last success during the transition period by getting a few of their allies appointed to high positions in the Royal Ministry, though those new ministers would not survive for long in the new political climate.

[(10:14)](#!):

When the Legislative Assembly got rolling in October 1791, they dove headlong into two related issues that they believed demanded immediate attention. What to do about intransigent priests who refused to take the civic oath, they were now called refractory priests or non-juring priests, and what to do about the emigres. As the delegates knew from their own personal experience, those two groups posed an active threat to the revolution, and until they were dealt with, there was no real point taking up other business.

[(10:48)](#!):

The issue of the non-juring priests was opened just a week into the first session of the Legislative Assembly, when a report was introduced detailing mass Catholic resistance in the Vendee region of western France. Since the civil constitution of the clergy had been initiated, priests who refused to take the civic oath had been treated fairly leniently, especially after the pope officially denounced the civil constitution back in March 1791. Sorry, I skipped over that part.

[(11:17)](#!):

Recognizing the difficult position this put many sincere Catholics, the National Assembly had granted refractory priests a pension, and even given them permission to hold unofficial services in unused churches. Hopefully, this would help reconcile everyone to the new religious regime. Instead, it gave the refractory priests a platform from which to attack the new religious regime. While the National Assembly was treating the French priests sympathetically, they had no such sympathy for the pope, who was clearly trying to stir up a religious civil war. Diplomatic relations were broken off with the Vatican, and then in May 1791 French forces occupied Avignon and the Comte-au-Vunissant, the two main papal enclaves within the French frontier. Then, in September, just as they were packing up to leave, the National Assembly formally annexed the two enclaves. This provocative annexation, of course, led to confrontations within the enclaves between pro-annexationist patriots and anti-annexationist conservatives.

[(12:22)](#!):

Shortly after the Legislative Assembly convened, a pro-annexationist official was lynched by an arch-Catholic gang in Avignon, and in retaliation, something like 60 anti-annexationist prisoners were slaughtered by their patriot guards. The Legislative Assembly was informed of the slaughter on October 21st, and coupled with the reports coming out of the Vendee, and the first-hand experience of most of the delegates themselves, it was clear that the religious schism was threatening to tear the nation apart. But as they wrestled with the problem of the seditious non-juring priests, the Legislative Assembly also took up the question of the emigres. The delegates believed that ignoring the threat posed by the emigres was folly, especially those delegates from the Southeast who had witnessed firsthand the emigre attempt to stir up a mass counter-revolutionary uprising.

[(13:17)](#!):

The National Assembly had attempted to force the emigres to come home in the wake of the flight to Varennes by announcing on July 9th, 1791, that the property of any emigre that did not return to France within one month would be subject to triple taxation. The king even sent out a public notice of his own on July 31st, calling for his brothers to return to France, but to no avail, and in fact, as we saw last time, emigration dramatically increased in the second half of 1791.

[(13:50)](#!):

At the behest of the newly convened Legislative Assembly, Louis reiterated on October 15th his public call for the princes to come home. The new constitution can work, you just have to stop fighting it. Then on October 20th, a delegate who was about to command the attention not just of France but of all Europe, stepped up to the podium and delivered his first major address. That man was Jacques-Pierre Brissot, and he is about to plunge Europe into war.

[(14:23)](#!):

Jacques-Pierre Brissot was born in January 1754, so he was about 37 years old when he stepped up to the proverbial mic in October 1791. He had studied law and apprenticed as a clerk in Paris, but law would turn out to be neither his passion nor his vocation, nor would he settle in Paris.

[(14:44)](#!):

Instead, he married a young woman adept at translating English works, and the couple moved up to London where they started a family. Brissot’s real passion was the written word, and while living in Paris, he made a living as a journalist and correspondent for various newspapers, and then trying to make a literary name for himself by publishing works of legal philosophy rooted in the theories of Rousseau.

[(15:07)](#!):

In the early 1780s, Brissot embarked on an ambitious venture to collect and publish the most advanced philosophical and scientific work from around the world all in one place, but the venture was too ambitious, and it failed. When he returned to Paris in 1784, he was promptly thrown in jail for allegedly publishing a little pornographic pamphlet starring Queen Marie Antoinette. Not exactly advanced enlightenment philosophy, but, you know, a guy’s gotta eat. But Brissot was not just thrown in any jail. He was chucked in the Bastille, making him one of the only revolutionaries to enjoy that honor. He was released four months later, and promptly published an open letter to Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, arguing that the emperor’s subjects were perfectly entitled to revolt against his rule any time they saw fit. Since Osteria was still technically a French ally, the heat came down again, and Brissot had to hightail it back to London.

[(16:05)](#!):

While in London this second time, he fell in with a new species of political activist, one heretofore unknown in world history\xe2\x80\x94abolitionists. Brissot became a passionate convert to the cause of slave emancipation, and it was these abolitionists’ belief that would help form the first bonds between the men who would all shortly be called the Girondins, who we’ll talk about next week. In 1788, Brissot toured the United States and hung out for a bit with famed Francophile and slave owner Thomas Jefferson, who was left with the impression that Brissot was getting ready to emigrate to the New World.

[(16:47)](#!):

But upon his return to the Old World, Brissot discovered France was on the verge of a massive political upheaval, so this was no time to split the scene. After press restrictions were loosened in the lead-up to the Estates General, Brissot started up a new paper called The French Patriot, and it quickly became one of the largest circulation journals in Paris. It earned him enough notoriety that he was soon elected into the new government of the Paris Commune. But philosophically, Brissot had more in common with the radicals of the Cordelie district than he did with his colleagues in the Paris Commune, most especially because Brissot had developed into an ardent Republican.

[(17:28)](#!):

He was generally opposed to all the injustices of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, but he also had a personal grudge against the royal family for locking him up in the Bastille and then chasing him back to London. Nothing he had seen since the convening of the Estates General had convinced him that the King and Queen were doing anything but playing for time until they could launch the counter-revolutionary coup clearly being planned by the reactionaries at court who were in league with the emigres and the Austrians.

[(17:56)](#!):

The flight to Varennes was for Brissot just further proof that this so-called Austrian plot existed, and as I noted, Brissot was the primary author of the Republican petition that was being signed at the Champs de Mars when Lafayette came down to break up the party. Brissot did not suffer for his involvement, however, and he was shortly thereafter elected as a delegate to the Legislative Assembly, representing Paris. So, back to his maiden address on October 20, 1791, Brissot’s topic was what do we do about the emigres? And boy was it a barn burner.

[(18:33)](#!):

Deploying a whole series of suggestive rhetorical questions, Brissot painted a picture of a vast Europe-wide conspiracy against France, orchestrated by the emigres, to topple the revolution. Why were Prussia and Austria cozying up to each other? Why had they issued the Declaration of Pillaments? Why had Russia just suddenly cut off its war with Turkey? Why were the Swedes assembling artillery? Then he thundered to the conclusion that French honor was at stake, and the time had come to take action.

[(19:05)](#!):

All property of the princes should be confiscated immediately, and if that didn’t bring them home, then France should attack those who harbored them. At the moment, this meant the electors of Trier and Mainz, a couple of minor German princes in whose territory the Comte d’Artois and his exiled court had set up shop. Emigrating French army officers had been flocking to that exiled court, and they now formed a hilariously top-heavy 4,000-man army that had like 3,994 officers and six, no doubt very put-upon, enlisted men.

[(19:41)](#!):

Brissot’s hard-line speech against the emigres was a massive hit in the legislative assembly, even if the delegates weren’t quite ready to declare war. If Brissot was ahead of the times with this kind of aggressive warmongering, though, he wasn’t too far ahead. On October 31, the legislative assembly gave the Comte de Provence, next in line to the throne, two months to return to France, or he would be written out of the line of succession. Then, on November 9, they passed a sweeping anti-emigre law. Return to France by January 1, or all your property will be confiscated and you will be considered traitors to the nation, a capital offense.

[(20:24)](#!):

This was all sent to the king for his signature, and you can probably guess what happened next. That’s right, Louis pulled out his perfectly legal veto pen, and he used it. The anti-emigre law was officially in suspenseive veto limbo, and there was nothing the legislative assembly could do about it. They were bound by constitutional rules drawn up by their predecessors, none of whom, mind you, were now around to defend the king’s legitimate right to veto a bill. The king tried to say that, look, the fact that I’m using the veto proves the system work, and that I’m not just some prisoner, that I’m an active partner in government. But the delegates of the legislative assembly didn’t care much about that. All they saw was further evidence that Brissot was right, and that there was a vast conspiracy built around the axis of the queen, the emigres, and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II.

[(21:18)](#!):

If only they knew then what we know now, things might have turned out different. Because though the queen was begging Leopold to get into it, Leopold was perfectly happy with the situation in France in the autumn of 1791. Why wreck it with a war? And as for the king’s emigre brothers, Leopold had done nothing but give them the brush-off, and the queen probably hated their guts more than anyone alive, because their preposterously inflammatory rhetoric threatened the safety of her and her children.

[(21:49)](#!):

While the delegates plotted what to do about the king’s veto of the anti-emigre law, they returned to the matter of those non-juring priests who were weakening the fabric of the nation from the inside, just as the emigres and their alleged Austrian baggers threatened it from the outside.

[(22:05)](#!):

The consensus now was that the refractory priests could no longer be treated with kid gloves, and that restrictions on their freedoms, up to and including exile, were perfectly acceptable measures given the circumstances. So on November the 29th, they decreed a new civic oath that must be taken within one week, same gist as the old one, loyalty to the nation above all. If anyone refused to take this second oath, they would be stripped of their pensions, and any priest who proved to be a double refractory, that is, had refused to take both oaths, well they were officially suspect, subject to inspection by a new surveillance committee, and they could be kicked out of any region deemed to be suffering from religious disturbances.

[(22:50)](#!):

And if you think that is going to do anything but exacerbate the situation, well then you have not been reading ahead.

[(22:57)](#!):

While all of this was debated, Briseau and his allies continued to press for military action against the German princes who harbored the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, arguing now that war would solve everything. It would neutralize the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, it would put Europe on notice that France would not be bullied, and most especially, it would help expose traitors at home. And for Briseau, that did not just mean secret reactionaries or non-juring priests, it meant most especially the royal family themselves. If the king and queen gave anything less than their full support to the war, it would prove that they were secretly in league with the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s and the Austrians.

[(23:37)](#!):

So on November 29th, oddly enough the same day the new civic oath was passed, a delegation from the legislative assembly went to the king and demanded that he issue an ultimatum to the German princes, expel the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, or face war. To everyone’s great surprise, the king heard them out and then said, yeah, okay, I’ll do it. So everyone’s on the same page now?

[(24:03)](#!):

Hardly. The king did not support the war for the same reasons Briseau and the legislative assembly did. No, Louis was convinced that if France attacked the German princes, that Austria would have to respond militarily. And once Austria was in the war, the overmatched French army would be swept aside, the Austrians would be able to march unopposed on Paris, and the royal family would be delivered from the clutches of the revolutionaries. So yeah, let’s go try and start a war, you guys. After consenting to the ultimatum, Louis then had the bit of political cover he needed to issue his second major veto, sending into suspense limbo the new civic oath.

[(24:45)](#!):

But that was less of an affront now that war was coming. I mean, that would help sort out the Patriots from the traitors far quicker anyway. As Briseau and his allies geared France up for war, they got critical support from a somewhat unexpected direction, the old liberal noble crowd surrounding the Marquis de Lafayette.

[(25:05)](#!):

Lafayette’s reputation had gone into a tailspin since the massacre of the Champs de Mars, and he had just been dealt a very public embarrassment. See, mayor of Paris Jean-Sylvain Bailly’s reputation had gone into a tailspin after the Champs de Mars mess too, and he decided it was time to retire from politics and go back to astronomy. In the mayoral elections that subsequently followed his retirement in mid-November, Lafayette had put himself forward as Bailly’s natural successor, and then gotten trounced two to one by a Jacobin candidate and intimate of Briseaux’s named Jerome Patillon.

[(25:43)](#!):

Patillon had recently made a name for himself by being one of the delegates selected to escort the royal family back from Varennes. But instead of being taken in by the family like Barnab, Patillon had acted with studious contempt for their supposed superiority and become a popular hero for his insolence. But now I’m digressing. Where was I? Ah yes, to keep from sliding into political oblivion, Lafayette threw his support beyond a war that was sure to bring him a high command, a little glory, and a renewed path to greatness.

[(26:17)](#!):

So really, it was only the fouillat and Maximilien Robespierre, as we’ll see in a second, who were nervous when Louis came down to the legislative assembly on December the 14th and announced that the ultimatum had been issued. The German princes must disperse the emigres by January the 15th, or it would be war. This was greeted by rapturous applause. Briseaux then took the stage again on December the 16th and extolled the coming war as a chance to regenerate France and expose all her hidden enemies.

[(26:49)](#!):

But then the German princes refused to play the part everyone assigned to them, and instead of standing firm, they immediately capitulated to the ultimatum and made it plain that they were ready to disperse the emigres, which was kind of a letdown back in Paris, where everyone was now spoiling for a quick and glorious little war. And that’s when the Austrians came blundering in to save the day. Learning of the ultimatum, and believing erroneously that their previous threats had cowed France into accepting moderate fouillat rule, the Austrians issued a blunt response to the ultimatum on December the 21st, and it said if you attack the German princes, we will attack you.

[(27:31)](#!):

But when the Austrian threat hit Paris on December the 31st, all it did was confirm every paranoid argument Briseaux had made about the alleged Austrian plot. Briseaux had in fact been depressed for a few days after the German princes refused to play along with his little war. Now he and his allies were rejuvenated, and the delegates of the legislative assembly were more willing than ever to listen to what they had to say. And what they now had to say was this, forget the princes, we need a war with Austria.

[(28:02)](#!):

The royal family was ecstatic by these renewed prospects for war, even as Barnov begged the queen to use her influence to secure peace. But she was behind attacking the Austrians a thousand percent, and it was then that Barnov realized he had overestimated his standing with the royal family. Depressed, he withdrew back to Dauphine. Toward the rather more ambitious end of provoking a war with the Austrians, Briseaux and his allies spent January 1792 delivering speech after speech in succession, playing up different themes, citing different causes, all designed to weave a web from which no uncommitted delegate could escape.

[(28:44)](#!):

There was an economic argument that a successful war would help stabilize the falling value of the Aussignan, the revolution’s paper currency that you can maybe win if you pause this episode right now and go buy a t-shirt at revolutionspodcastfundraiser.com. Anyway, victory would give the French more international credibility, and European financiers would feel more confident investing in France and accepting the Aussignan as payment.

[(29:12)](#!):

Then there was the argument that war would end all domestic strife. Enemies of the revolution inside France would expose themselves and be dealt with accordingly. Enemies outside France, like the belligerent \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, would simply be destroyed. Then there was, of course, the ever-present Austrophobia of everyone in the room. No one liked the Austrians. Everyone hated the dishonor the Treaty of 1756 had brought upon France. This basic hatred of the Austrians helped sway more than a few uncommitted delegates who might otherwise have had doubts.

[(29:47)](#!):

And then finally, there was the argument that has been trotted out to sell every war in the history of the world. It will be quick, it will be easy, and we will surely win. The Holy Roman Empire is a tottering relic just waiting to be pushed over by the rising might of the fully mobilized French nation. Now it takes someone who is just a touch mad to stand against this kind of nationalistic warmongering once it gets going. And I think it’s fair to say that Maximilien Robespierre was just a touch mad. Rousseau and his allies were making their case not just in the legislative assembly, but in the Jacobin Club, where they were becoming the dominant faction.

[(30:28)](#!):

But Robespierre refused to go along with them. And for every thundering call to arms, Robespierre would step forward and answer in his tight and dispassionate style of oratory. The fortunes of war are uncertain, he said, even in the most favorable circumstances. To lose such a war at this moment would be disastrous. And what makes you think we can even beat the Austrians? Have you not read the reports of our army’s state of readiness? Plus, even if we are victorious, all you will have done is hand the keys over to the victorious generals who will be hailed as national heroes, and who will then turn around and establish a military dictatorship, ahem, Lafayette.

[(31:08)](#!):

But Robespierre’s big point was that where Brissau saw the war as the solution to domestic strife, Robespierre believed that domestic strife had to be solved first before going to war. We must deal with our internal enemies before we can deal with our external enemies. But of course, Robespierre could only make these arguments in the Jacobin Club. He had no voice in the legislative assembly, and in that body, no one stood against the march to war.

[(31:38)](#!):

On January the 25th, 1792, they formally declared that the Treaty of 1756 was broken beyond repair due to Austrian aggression, and they told the king to tell the Austrians that if they didn’t stand down by March the 1st, France would declare war on them. The king, secretly delighting in all this, told the assembly offhand that, A, you’re really kind of overstepping your authority here, foreign relations is really my business, and B, I’ve already told the Austrians to back down, and am just waiting for their response.

[(32:10)](#!):

But the Austrians were themselves now convinced more than ever that all they had to do was stay puffed up, and the French would back down. I mean, how could the revolutionaries possibly believe their headless and disorganized army can stand against the professional and experienced army of the Austrians? But even if the French didn’t back down and war came, the Austrians were as convinced as the French that the war would be quick, and it would be easy, and they would surely win. Funny how that works out. So Austria greeted the French ultimatum with defiance, and then told the Prussians that they were ready to sign that alliance that the Prussians had been angling for these past two years.

[(32:51)](#!):

The Prussians wasted no time taking yes for an answer, and on February the 7th, the long-standing rivals were suddenly allies. Within the week, the Prussians had a campaign strategy worked up, and had sent representatives to Vienna to coordinate the attack, which the most pessimistic estimate expected to last no more than two months. It would in fact last a generation.

[(33:18)](#!):

So that is where we will leave off, everyone barreling towards a war that everyone believed would be over in no time. And next time, we’ll plunge into that war. But as I mentioned, I’m going to have to take off the next two weeks, so I won’t be back until January the 11th.

[(33:35)](#!):

So when you get up next Monday morning, and there’s no episode, and you contemplate what a dismal place the world would be if there was never an episode waiting for you on Monday morning ever again, please go to RevolutionsPodcastFundraiser.com. Happy Saturnolia.

## 3.21a Supplemental- Talleyrand

 [(00:01)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Supplemental 3.21a, Talleyrand. So I was in fact able to carve out some time to produce this little gift before I officially come back next week. And while I’m here I’d also like to say that I’m glad to see everyone buying gifts for themselves at revolutionspodcastfundraiser.com. It closes up shop in just about three weeks, so now is the time to buy.

[(00:38)](#!):

But the supplemental is also a gift to myself, because as I mentioned once upon a time, one of my favorite great men of history is the brilliant, duplicitous, farsighted, amoral, treasonous, brutally cold-hearted, seductively passionate, pragmatic, womanizing, excommunicated, atheist ex-bishop and greatest diplomat of all time, Charlie Maurice de Talleyrand, or as I know him, Talleyrand.

[(01:03)](#!):

But tragically, though he has been around for everything that has happened so far in the French Revolution, he’s always been just off to one side, and hard to wedge directly into the story when other men around him are just a little bit more central to the narrative at any given moment. It’s been bugging me that I haven’t gotten to talk more about the man whose name has become a byword for both amoral double-dealing and unrivaled diplomatic prowess. So here today, I give you the early life and times of Talleyrand.

[(01:35)](#!):

Talleyrand was born in Paris in 1754 into an old noble family that held a position at court. He was the oldest child of a younger son of that noble family, however, so Talleyrand’s parents weren’t themselves particularly rich or prominent.

[(01:51)](#!):

His father was an army officer, constantly on assignment, and Talleyrand said later that he was basically raised an orphan, never having spent more than a week total under the same roof as his parents. When he was a toddler, he developed a debilitating and permanent limp in one leg that was either a birth defect or the result of an accident, the latter being Talleyrand’s own explanation. This limp precluded the military career his disappointed father had planned for him, and so Talleyrand was instead pointed towards a career in the church.

[(02:24)](#!):

But since a priest couldn’t also serve as a proper head of a family, Talleyrand was simultaneously stripped of his inheritance rights as firstborn son, and they were bestowed upon his younger brother. The disinherited Talleyrand was then shipped off to boarding school, and then a few years later to a seminary. But though he was something of an embarrassment, his parents did still have high hopes for him. His uncle was the Archbishop of Reims, and the plan was for Talleyrand to eventually succeed to that position, which would bring a huge salary and control of church lands that would enrich his relatively impoverished nuclear family.

[(03:04)](#!):

When he got to seminary, however, Talleyrand discovered he did not much like the church, and the church did not much like him. He was a precocious reader and freethinker who took one look at the superstitious dogmatism of Catholicism and decided it was all a bunch of laughable nonsense. Then when he became a teenager, he became, well, a teenager. He liked having a good time, he liked staying out late, and then he discovered girls.

[(03:33)](#!):

At the age of 21, Talleyrand was freed from the confines of the seminary and sent to finish his studies at the Sorbonne in Paris. There he either blossomed further or rotted further, depending on who you talk to. He embraced the freedom and delights of Paris, made fast friends with other carefree young nobles, and then added the final piece to his disreputable puzzle when he discovered cards, at which he immediately became an obsessive shark.

[(04:02)](#!):

In many ways, Talleyrand is the perfect example of everything pious Catholics complained about in the church of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime. Here was this gambling young noble who liked to drink wine all night, cavort with mistresses, and make an open secret of his atheism. And not only did he not get kicked out of the church, he was rapidly promoted because of family connections at court. He was indeed given positions within the church bureaucracy and enjoyed the salaries they provided before he was even ordained as a priest. After he finally was ordained at the age of 25, Talleyrand was appointed an agent general of the church, traditionally considered a cushy job that required little work in exchange for a fat salary. But once he was appointed agent general, the other side of Talleyrand emerged, because he was not in fact some shiftless, good-for-nothing leech on society. Talleyrand was bursting with energy, full of ideas, and he had a passion for good, hard, intellectually stimulating work.

[(05:04)](#!):

As agent general, he found himself overseeing church property and immediately put what he controlled to more efficient and profitable use than his less enthusiastic predecessors had managed.

[(05:16)](#!):

He also undertook a huge inspection tour of northwest France that led him to write up an unexpectedly impressive report that recommended a huge list of practical reforms, though not all of them were embraced. When Talleyrand, for example, discovered that wives of fishermen lost at sea were trapped in a terrible legal limbo that did not allow them to be considered widows and thus eligible for remarriage, the enlightened pragmatist Talleyrand recommended that if a number of years passed, you know, let’s let him move on.

[(05:47)](#!):

But the church council he recommended this to was appalled by his lack of respect for the spiritual bonds of marriage and did not take Talleyrand’s advice. The fishermen’s wives remained trapped in limbo. But this hard-working reformist Talleyrand never got in the way of entertaining man-about-town Talleyrand, and through the 1780s he made quite a name for himself in the Paris salons for many fine, but other not-so-fine reasons. He was acknowledged one of the finest conversationalists of the day and an intellectual force to be reckoned with, but also one of the most amoral cadres in Paris who didn’t seem to care about the scandals he always left in his wake.

[(06:29)](#!):

But in spite of his immorality, he expected to soon be appointed to high ecclesiastic office, and while he waited he struck up a mutually admiring rapport with Controller General Calhoun, and in February 1787 Calhoun invited Talleyrand to join the secret little working group that was cobbling together the reform package that Calhoun was about to present to the First Assembly of Notables, and this all happened back in episode 3.5.

[(06:55)](#!):

But when Talleyrand showed up to take on his assignment he was shocked to discover how disorganized and last-minute Calhoun’s preparations seemed to be, and as you’ll recall the Assembly of Notables took the same view, using the haphazard nature of Calhoun’s package as an excuse to go through it line by line and object to practically everything. As the Assembly of Notables gave way to the Estates General, Talleyrand gravitated naturally into Adrien Dupour’s liberal-noble society of thirty. At the same time he found himself finally appointed to high ecclesiastic office when King Louis made him Bishop of Houton in late 1788, mostly as a favour to Talleyrand’s dying father.

[(07:38)](#!):

Talleyrand had of course never been to Houton in his life, and would in fact only go there once as their bishop. That was in April 1789 when he wanted the local clerics to elect him as their representative to the Estates General. When he arrived in Houton he did his best to talk the clerical talk and he managed to get himself elected as a first estate delegate from Houton, which speaks volumes for his ability to talk his way into just about anything. Because election secured, Talleyrand then ducked out of town before Easter so he wouldn’t have to lead mass, which, despite being a bishop, he had no idea how to do.

[(08:17)](#!):

In the early days of the Estates General, Talleyrand was of course in the liberal-noble minority of the first estate, but he prudently remained one step behind the rush of events. He was not among the first clerical deputies to defect over to the third estate, and only took his seat in the National Assembly after the botched royal session in June 1789. In typical Talleyrand fashion, he said of his decision to take a seat in the National Assembly, there remained only one rational course of action, to yield freely before being compelled and while one could still earn favor from doing so.

[(08:56)](#!):

Good advice for all of you aspiring, cynical survivors out there. But despite all of his enlightened rationalism and embrace of reform, Talleyrand was not a revolutionary. A revolution is way too messy and unpredictable. So when the crisis of July 1789 hit and the Bastille fell, he had a secret meeting in the palace in the middle of the night with the Comte d’Artois. Talleyrand told d’Artois that if he wanted to save the monarchy, the only course of action would be to violently suppress the insurrection in Paris and then break up the National Assembly by force.

[(09:30)](#!):

Anything less than that would be the end of the Bourbon dynasty. d’Artois took this advice to Louis, but Louis refused to take such tyrannical measures, and d’Artois decided to emigrate from France the next morning. He and Talleyrand would not meet again for twenty-five years when the memory of that midnight conversation secured Talleyrand an influential position in the soon-to-be restored Bourbon dynasty.

[(09:56)](#!):

More good advice for you aspiring, cynical survivors out there. Plant all the seeds you can. You never know which one might grow a life-saving vine for you down the road. Back in his daytime role as liberal noble bishop in the National Assembly, Talleyrand was appointed to a position on the all-important constitutional committee. For the moment, that committee was dominated by Meunier, who Talleyrand was happy to work alongside, but certainly not follow out the door when Meunier resigned the committee after his proposals for a two-house legislature and absolute veto for the king failed. That was all in episode 3.13.

[(10:34)](#!):

Talleyrand would in fact stay on the constitutional committee for the rest of the National Assembly’s existence, though he was never its driving force. Politically, he liked to stay one step behind so he could avoid pitfalls that often consumed those in the vanguard. But that said, on matters of religion, the non-believing Talleyrand was actually further out in front than almost anyone. On October 10, 1789, he was the first to propose the nationalization of church property as a solution to the debt crisis in episode 3.15.

[(11:07)](#!):

Talleyrand was intimately familiar with the church’s portfolio and believed two-thirds of its vast holdings would be more than enough to support a Reformed church. The rest could be used as collateral to secure necessary bridge loans to see the kingdom through these tight times. These forward ideas led him to become an early member of the Jacobin Club, but he soon drifted over to the far less rabble-filled Society of 1789, where men of standing and education could converse comfortably without being heckled by belligerent fishmongers.

[(11:41)](#!):

He then stayed out in front on religious matters, backed the new civil constitution of the clergy, and then wound up being one of only two bishops to take the first civic oath. His quote-unquote constituency, back-quote-unquote home in Utan, then declared him a backstabbing Judas, so Talleyrand simply resigned the bishopric, which he reckoned was about to be legally abolished anyway. But his fellow delegates in the National Assembly probably wished he hadn’t defrocked himself quite so quickly. The newly elected constitutional bishops would need to be ordained by an existing bishop to secure the legitimizing link of apostolic succession.

[(12:22)](#!):

But no Ancien Regime bishop would ordain the sacrilegious new constitutional bishops. So in March 1790, Talleyrand agreed to ordain the first group of three new bishops so they could go ordain the rest, everyone overlooking the inconvenient fact that Talleyrand had already resigned his own bishopric. This is right about the time he gets excommunicated by the pope, an excommunication Talleyrand celebrated with a party of cold meat and iced wine, because all good Christians were now supposed to deny him fire and water.

[(12:58)](#!):

In the daily grind of the National Assembly, Talleyrand spent most of his time enmeshed in securing the financial health of the kingdom, and he was no fan of the drive to rest the new order on the shoulders of the Asignon, the revolution’s paper money that Talleyrand correctly predicted would soon create a destructive whirlwind of inflation.

[(13:17)](#!):

But when he wasn’t buried in ledgers, he focused his energy on a great passion project, the total reinvention of French public education. Free and compulsory education was his goal, and his resulting report on public education laid out a remarkably modern program, but unfortunately that program would be buried in the chaos of the coming, well, chaos. In July 1790, the revolutionary leadership was again having a hard time getting a respectable bishop to bless their work.

[(13:51)](#!):

Specifically, no one would preside over the great feast of the Federation, celebrating the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. So the self-defrocked Talleyrand was tapped again, and over his own doubts that he could even run the ceremony properly, he put on the heavy robes and did his best to muddle through his part of the theatrics, all of which I described in episode 3.16. There is an apocryphal little story that goes along with that, though, that when he administered the great patriotic oath to Lafayette at the climax of the celebration, that Talleyrand said, quote, Don’t make me laugh.

[(14:28)](#!):

Which is interpreted either to be a dig at the ambitious Lafayette’s allegedly high-minded and self-effacing patriotism, as in, you know, don’t make me laugh, or as a genuine request that Lafayette please not make Talleyrand laugh, because Talleyrand was trying to get through this absurd ceremony with a straight face. He spent the rest of the National Assembly’s life diligently working on constitutional business alongside the triumvirate of Lema\xc3\xaetre, Barnab\xc3\xa9, and his old intellectual acquaintance Dupour, the triumvirate who now controlled the Constitutional Committee.

[(15:03)](#!):

Talleyrand had for a while been angling for a position in the Royal Ministry, but he had to give that up when the National Assembly barred its members from serving in dual roles. He also would have maybe tried for a seat in the coming Legislative Assembly, had he not been barred along with the rest of his colleagues from seeking election. So when the National Assembly dispersed in September 1791, Talleyrand found himself out of power and out of a job.

[(15:30)](#!):

But soon enough, his friend from the good old carousing days in Paris, the Comte de Narbonne, was appointed Minister of War, and Narbonne tapped Talleyrand in early 1792 to go to London and act as an unofficial agent of the revolutionary government. So that more or less catches us up to where we left off in the main narrative. But just to wrap up this phase of Talleyrand’s life, I’ll give you the details of the inauspicious launch to his otherwise magnificent diplomatic career.

[(16:02)](#!):

Apart from serving officially as an ambassador, he was sent unofficially to London to secure British neutrality when France and Austria inevitably declared war come the spring of 1792. Talleyrand was eager to take the job, as he was a great believer that a commercial and military alliance between Great Britain and France would be beneficial to both countries.

[(16:24)](#!):

But this first diplomatic adventure turned out to be a personal failure, though technically a public success. He was received badly by the Ministry of William Pitt the Younger, and even worse by King George III and his wife Queen Charlotte, who literally turned her back on this atheist ex-bishop who all reputable gossip had it as lacking any morals whatsoever. But luckily for Talleyrand, Prime Minister Pitt had already decided to stay out of the coming Franco-Austrian war. So as badly as Talleyrand was treated, he got what he was sent to get \xe2\x80\x94 British neutrality.

[(17:01)](#!):

Once the war between Austria and France did break out in April 1792, and we’ll get into all that next week, Talleyrand will be sent back to London to make sure the British stay neutral. And repeating his experience, he’ll once again be treated shabbily by the British, but with Pitt still set on British neutrality in the Continental War, Talleyrand will technically succeed in his mission.

[(17:25)](#!):

So we’ll leave him there for now, ready to come back to Paris in the early summer of 1792. Talleyrand is about to disappear completely from the scene, as the coming Republican insurrection of August the 10th 1792 will force him into a hasty emigration back to England, where he will stay for two years until being booted from the country by Pitt’s order of expulsion in 1794. Finding no safe haven in Europe, he will actually wind up living in Philadelphia for two years, where among other things he’ll make friends with Alexander Hamilton.

[(17:59)](#!):

He’ll finally return to our main stage in 1797. After being allowed to return to France, he will be appointed Foreign Minister of the Directory, the regime that will rule the country after the fall of Robespierre. As we will see, Talleyrand will faithfully serve the Directory outwardly, but inwardly, he will recognize about two days into the gig that the Directory is fatally flawed and destined to fail.

[(18:23)](#!):

So Talleyrand will spend his idle moments keeping tabs on men who might help him topple the Directory, and give France a government it could be proud of. And it wasn’t long before he noticed, and then started up an admiring correspondence with a young general from Corsica who was having remarkable success in Italy, Napoleon Bonaparte.

The French believed the Austrians were a stagnant relic that could not possibly withstand the might of the fully mobilized French nation. The Austrians believed the French armies were in disarray, the French treasury was empty, and the French leadership was a bunch of amateur lawyers who could not possibly withstand the might of a wet tissue, let alone the combined weight of the Austrian and Prussian armies.

[(02:12)](#!):

Prussians meanwhile thought the coming war would last approximately zero months and result in their getting some prime real estate for no money down. A Prussian minister actually advised a group of officers not to buy new horses for the campaign since the fighting wouldn’t last long enough to make it worth the expense. Everyone turned out to be spectacularly wrong about all of this.

Revolutions Podcast Fundraiser dot com.

[(03:09)](#!):

To back up a little bit so we can understand the chain of events for today’s episode, you’ll recall that just as the new legislative assembly was convening in October 1791, that the Founia Club managed to get a few of their guys appointed to key positions within the royal ministry. And so, over the winter of 1791-1792, Louie was surrounded by what is called the Founia Ministry. They favored strong prerogatives for the king, and were not in favor of launching a war.

[(03:37)](#!):

But one key position they did not hold was Minister of War. That was because the sitting Minister of War had been appointed back in November 1790, and did not resign until December 1791. By the time that vacancy popped up, the influence of the Founia was already on the wane, and so they were unable to prevent the appointment of the Comte de Narbonne to the job. As I mentioned last week, Narbonne was an old drinking buddy of Talleyrand’s, and both remained unreconstructed liberal nobles. It was, for example, at Narbonne’s initiative that Lafayette was appointed to high command within the army in mid-December 1791, an appointment that might otherwise be difficult to explain given the collapse of Lafayette’s public reputation.

[(04:24)](#!):

Narbonne believed that a quick war with Austria would be just the thing to reassert the legitimacy of the Constitution of 1791, and to this end, he went on an inspection tour of the frontier over the winter, and came back with a report saying that everything was groovy, and we only need a couple more thousand troops to fill in some recent losses in personnel. This was an optimistic assessment, to say the least.

[(04:49)](#!):

By March 1, 1792, a war had become all but unavoidable. Remember, that was the day Louis had marked as Ultimatum Day for the Austrians. But when the Legislative Assembly convened on March 1, what they read from the Austrians was not a letter of contrition, but rather a bellicose declaration promising to end the upstart revolutionaries if they didn’t stand down. That sent the assembly into a fit, the immediate consequences of which we’ll talk about in a second, but before we do, we need to talk about the other thing that happened on March 1 that made war unavoidable.

[(05:26)](#!):

Though the French couldn’t yet know it, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II suddenly died that very day.

[(05:34)](#!):

Remember, Leopold had long been trying to stay out of a war with France, and was under the impression that further Austrian blustering would lead the French to turn their collective backs on Jacques-Pierre Brissot and his war-mongering friends, and restore the moderate fouya to power. Would Leopold have pulled back when he realized the blustering was having the opposite of its intended effect? Who knows, because he died, and was succeeded by his 24-year-old son Francis II. Francis was young and inexperienced, and at this moment couldn’t possibly put the brakes on the war even if he wanted to.

[(06:09)](#!):

So as I have said a few times now, all the Austrian saber-rattling wound up doing was lead the Legislative Assembly to throw their lot in completely with Brissot and his pro-war gang. Adding fuel to the fire, someone had managed to procure the quote-unquote ultimatum the king had sent the Austrians, which was written by his foreign minister, an unassuming fouya bureaucrat named Antoine de Lysar. Lysar’s ultimatum turned out to have been some pretty weak tea, and seemed to explain exactly why the Austrians felt comfortable answering with further chest-thumping. The outraged Legislative Assembly voted immediately to impeach Lysar.

[(06:50)](#!):

After these revelations, War Minister Narbonne publicly laid into his fouya colleagues, which was not really something you’re supposed to do if you’re a royal minister, so instead of sacking his beleaguered foreign minister, Louis instead sacked his loud-mouthed war minister, which only upped the fury of the Legislative Assembly. They met on the night of March the 9th to prepare articles of impeachment for Lysar, whose trial would be used as an opening to tear down the whole fouya ministry, and possibly the whole monarchy. There was now open talk of impeaching the queen and suspending the king.

[(07:24)](#!):

Louis had no interest in letting the Legislative Assembly put on that kind of show, and there’s even evidence that Louis very particularly did not wish to play Charles I to Lysar’s Earl of Strafford, a historical reference that we should all now be well acquainted with. So instead, on March the 10th, the king dismissed his entire ministry, and formed a new one from a list of acceptable candidates supplied by the Legislative Assembly. This new ministry has become known to history as the Girondin Ministry.

[(07:55)](#!):

We’ll have plenty of time to talk about the Girondins in the episode to come, but just so you know, they’ll get saddled with that name because some of the most prominent members of their party hailed from Girondin, a department in southwest France that included the city of Bordeaux. When this delegation arrived in Paris, they intermingled with Brissot and his crowd and then a few other prominent figures who shared a basic worldview that skewed Republican, though there is no discernible Girondin platform or ideology to speak of. But for the moment, they didn’t need a broad platform. All they needed to rise to power was the one single issue that bound them all together, the one single issue they harped on relentlessly through the winter of 1791-1792. War with Austria, War with Austria, War with Austria.

[(08:43)](#!):

So just remember, at this point, Girondin and warmonger are synonymous.

[(08:51)](#!):

The place where these loosely affiliated Girondin met after hours was in the salon of one Madame Rolland. Madame Rolland was a politically ambitious young woman from Lyon, married to a politically ambitious manufacturer and sometime philosopher, Jean-Marie Rolland. By all accounts, Madame Rolland was the more impressive and influential of the two, but the rules of the day forced her to sit on the sidelines. As the revolution picked up steam, the couple moved from Lyon to Paris, where Madame Rolland did what she was able to do according to the rules of the day. She began hosting a regular salon, through which most of the future Girondins came into contact with each other. This salon elevated her husband’s profile enormously, and when their old friend Brissot began to dominate the legislative assembly and then orchestrate the teardown of the Fouillon ministry in March 1792, Madame Rolland made sure her husband was appointed Minister of the Interior.

[(09:50)](#!):

Now all that said, initially, the leading figure in the new Girondin ministry was not a Girondin at all. That leading figure was new Foreign Minister Charles-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Dumourieuil.

[(10:03)](#!):

Dumourieuil was a career soldier and veteran of the Seven Years War, the disastrous consequences of which he blamed solely on the Austrians, who he hated with the heat of a thousand suns. His alliance with Brissot and the Girondins were not based on any real shared political principles. Indeed, Dumourieuil’s plan was to use a short war to re-establish the power and authority of the crown, which was certainly not what Brissot was after. But the only person on earth who wanted war with the Austrians more than Brissot was Dumourieuil, so the alliance was sealed.

[(10:37)](#!):

After he became Foreign Minister, Dumourieuil would periodically show up at the Jacobin Club to deliver further evidence that the Austrians were weak and the French were strong. When he delivered these speeches, he often wore for dramatic effect a red Phrygian cap, modeled on those worn by freed slaves in ancient Rome. Though Dumourieuil was not the first to wear the red cap of liberty, his embrace of it on the brink of a patriotic war caused the fashion to spread throughout Paris, and it became an enduring symbol of the revolution right along with the tri-color cockade.

[(11:13)](#!):

By the end of March, Austria learned that their belligerence had backfired, and that the French war party had pushed its way into power. So in the middle of April, they moved 50,000 troops into position along the border, and it was clearly now just a matter of when, not if, the war would commence. When reports of the full Austrian mobilization reached Paris, the legislative assembly decided there could be no further delay, and they told the king it was time to make good his ultimatum. So King Louis and his ministers entered the legislative assembly on April the 20th, 1792, to do just that.

[(11:48)](#!):

Dumourieuil kicked things off with a scathing attack on the Austrians and every poisonous fruit born of the Despicable Treaty of 1756, which had made France the slave of Austria and drained French blood and treasure in the service of a deceitful and treacherous ally. Then to the rapturous applause of all the assembled delegates and spectators, the king stepped forward and asked for the assembly to declare war, which they did nearly unanimously. There were only seven no votes from the 700-plus delegates.

[(12:21)](#!):

Pointedly though, this declaration of war was aimed only at the king of Hungary and Bohemia, that is, Francis II. This was because A, Francis hadn’t been confirmed as Holy Roman Emperor yet, but more importantly because B, this was allegedly going to be a new kind of war, one aimed only at the despotic monarch and not his people. The legislative assembly swore that this would only be a defensive war waged against an aggressive tyrant who threatened French liberty. They further swore that French arms would never be used against the natural liberty of other peoples and that the lives and property of those other peoples would always be protected by French soldiers. This all sounded great and was maybe even believed by a few of those voting for war, but it sure didn’t take long for all those pledges to get tossed overboard.

[(13:15)](#!):

Back on the other side of the lines, King Frederick William II of Prussia was simply delighted that the French were taking the initiative to declare war because that meant when the Prussians inevitably won, he would be able to extract further concessions at the bargaining table because France will have technically started it. The Austrians for their part did not wait for the French to take the initiative. On April the 28th, two days before they actually received the French declaration of war, Francis II and his ministers themselves declared war on France. And so it was war.

[(13:49)](#!):

The French forces were arrayed in three main armies along the frontier. The Army of the North was stationed up near Lille and was commanded by our old friend General Rochambeau, hero of the American War of Independence and long-time liberal noble supporter of the Revolution. The Army of the Center sat along the Moselle River and was commanded by Lafayette who was chomping at the bit to rehabilitate his reputation. Further south was the Army of the Rhine, commanded by of all things a Bavarian named Nicholas Luckner who had served in the French army since 1763.

[(14:25)](#!):

It was agreed that the opening move in the war would come in the north where Rochambeau’s army would cross the border into the Austrian Netherlands, aka Belgium, where they would be greeted as liberators by the locals who would then help the French permanently detach the region from Austrian control. Now here I must pause for a moment, because in all my discussions of the confusing dance of European international diplomacy, I have somehow managed to not talk about the Austrian Netherlands or their recently failed attempt to declare independence from Habsburg rule.

[(14:60)](#!):

The quick and dirty history of all this is that after the War of Spanish Succession ended badly for the Spanish in 1715, their possessions in Europe were divided amongst the victorious powers. At the insistence of the British and Dutch, the Spanish Netherlands were given to the Austrians, mostly because the British and Dutch didn’t want the territory to fall under French dominion. But the funny thing is that the Austrians didn’t really want the Spanish Netherlands, which were geographically isolated from the rest of their domains. The Austrians only accepted the territory at the behest of their then ally, Great Britain.

[(15:36)](#!):

For the next 75 years, the Habsburgs would show up at every European treaty negotiation or interstate summit, dying to trade the Netherlands away in exchange for what they really wanted, which was Bavaria. Because locking up Bavaria would complete their domination over southern Germany. But they could never get anyone else to go along with it, so they were stuck with this little island of territory up on the North Sea.

[(16:02)](#!):

The locals in the now Austrian Netherlands were never given much attention by the Habsburgs until the 1780s, when Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II started rolling out his project of enlightened reforms, which were heatedly opposed by the locals. So shortly after the French Revolution broke out, these locals rose up in revolt, kicked out the Austrian garrison in October 1789, and declared themselves the United Belgian States.

[(16:29)](#!):

But this self-declared little country was not recognized by the other European powers, and was badly divided internally. So when Leopold II succeeded his brother in September 1790, one of the first things he did was roll an army into the United Belgian States and turn them back into the Austrian Netherlands.

[(16:49)](#!):

The important thing for us to keep in mind, though, is just how badly this was all misunderstood by the revolutionaries in France. All they appear to have seen was a subject people rising up against the despotism of an absolute monarch, you know, just like us. What they utterly failed to recognize was that this uprising got going because the local nobility and conservative Catholics didn’t like the thrust of the Habsburgs’ enlightened reforms.

[(17:16)](#!):

So the aims of the revolutionaries in France\xe2\x80\x94anti-aristocratic and anti-clerical\xe2\x80\x94and the aims of the revolutionaries in Belgium\xe2\x80\x94pro-aristocratic and pro-clerical\xe2\x80\x94could not have been more opposed. So for the French to think that they would be greeted by anything but overt hostility when they crossed the border in April 1792 was the purest of follies. But on April 28, 1792, coincidentally the same day the Austrians declared war, the first French forces crossed the border. It then became immediately apparent that the war was not going to be the cakewalk that Brissot and the Girondins had been selling.

[(17:55)](#!):

The vanguard of the French Army of the North was a 5,000-man mix of veteran cavalry and newly raised volunteer infantry under the command of an Irish general named Theobald Dillon. Dillon’s forces quickly ran into a battery of Austrian artillery, took one look at the guns, and turned and ran. The most demoralizing part of this ignoble flight was that it was not triggered by the new volunteers but by the seasoned cavalry, which did not bode well for the French. The flight of the cavalry then got caught up with a pre-planned withdrawal of some forces further down the road. Suddenly the whole line was engulfed in a panicked retreat.

[(18:35)](#!):

General Dillon himself took refuge in a peasant cottage, where he made the ill-fated decision to take off his uniform coat. Suspecting that he was housing a traitor, the peasant-sheltering Dillon alerted some nearby soldiers, who barged in, took the protesting general into custody, and dragged him off to Lille. There, General Dillon did not even enjoy the spectacle of a kangaroo court. He was convicted of treason by the riotous acclamation of a mob composed mostly of regular soldiers, national guardsmen, and civic-minded locals, who then stabbed Dillon to death and hung his body from a lamppost.

[(19:10)](#!):

Luckily, in the midst of all this chaos, neither the Austrians nor the Prussians were yet in position to take advantage of the situation, so the war was not immediately lost. The consequences of this whole fiasco were twofold. First, it absolutely destroyed whatever morale was left among the French officers. Remember, well over half the old officer corps had already emigrated. Those that remained were just told in no uncertain terms that the punishment for failure in the field would be mob execution. And it’s not like every battle and skirmish is just going to go our way, you know, things happen. So, the desertion rate skyrocketed.

[(19:52)](#!):

The second consequence was to turn Paris into a paranoid madhouse. There are a lot of different moments you can point to and say, this is the moment when the French Revolution goes from this project of enlightened human progress into an insanely bloody free-for-all. But for me, it’s basically the moment Paris finds out about the fiasco in the north, because it is all going to get very paranoid and very bloody from here on out. The immediate problem for Brissot and his allies in the legislative assembly was to explain why the supposedly invincible French army had just turned and run at the first sign of the enemy.

[(20:30)](#!):

So Brissot stood up and said, look guys, this isn’t that big of a deal. I probably shouldn’t have promised total victory right out of the gates. There are going to be some stumbles while our armies get their feet under them. It’s just the nature of the beast, so you know, everyone relax. Oh wait, he didn’t say that at all. He launched into a full-throated conspiracy theory that asserted that the royal family, the generals in the field, and a cabal of aristocratic reactionaries he collectively dubbed the Austrian Committee were plotting to intentionally lose the war.

[(21:04)](#!):

The legislative assembly that had bought into Brissot’s propaganda in the first place and now needed to defend their rush to war were happy to believe his conspiracy theories rather than admit that they had maybe miscalculated. Between three top generals, Rochambeau, Lafayette, and Luckner, sent a joint dispatch on May the 18th urging peace rather than risking these raw and poorly led armies in battle, well that was just further proof of a treasonous conspiracy to hand France over to the Austrians. It was also the last thing Rochambeau did before resigning. This certainly was a new kind of war, and one he wanted no part of.

[(21:45)](#!):

Because the problem did not lay with the French army, or the righteousness of the French cause but rather a sinister network of internal enemies, the legislative assembly turned all their attention to rooting out those enemies. On May the 20th they passed a law putting all foreigners under surveillance. Then a week later they passed a law allowing for the immediate deportation of any non-juring priest who had been denounced by a sufficient number of active citizens. Then on May 29th they decreed that Louis’ personal bodyguard would be dissolved.

[(22:18)](#!):

This last measure though was accepted suspiciously easily by the king and fed fears that he didn’t mind losing his bodyguard because he knew the regular troops left in Paris were preparing to launch a royalist coup. So the legislative assembly announced on June the 8th that all regular troops left in Paris were hereby ordered to the front lines, and 20,000 dependable National Guardsmen would be dispatched from their local departments to help defend Paris. This influx was to conveniently coincide with the coming celebrations on July the 14th of the now third anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.

[(22:55)](#!):

The king, however, sensed an opportunity to keep his enemies divided when he learned that the 8,000 or so men of the Parisian National Guard were not happy that their collective prestige was about to be diminished by the mass arrival of mere provincials. They wrote a petition to the legislative assembly protesting the order, and Louis announced his intention to support them and veto the order. He also announced his intention to veto that thing about deporting non-juring priests.

[(23:23)](#!):

This triggered an almost unprecedented breach of political etiquette. Interior minister Roland, almost certainly at the prodding of Madame Roland, sent a blistering letter to the king, very possibly written by Madame Roland, attacking Louis for blocking the will of the French people. A royal minister publicly attacking his own king was unheard of, and it didn’t take long for Louis to respond. Roland was dismissed along with most of his colleagues on June the 13th.

[(23:53)](#!):

Foreign minister Dumourieu resigned two days later, though it is entirely possible he was happy to be leaving, since he made straight for the front lines to take up an active military command and hopefully kill a bunch of Austrians. Still technically holding the right to appoint his own ministers, Louis then replaced the House de Girondins with minor non-entities, formerly of the Founia Club. This sudden ministerial bloodbath galvanized the people of Paris into forceful action.

[(24:24)](#!):

Ever since the massacre of the Champs de Mars, the populous leaders of the capital had been laying low. But as 1792 had progressed, they began to come out of the shadows, and then they began to re-rally the people. As usual, they were able to get their foot back in the door due to food shortages in Paris. But this time, it wasn’t a basic commodity like bread that was disruptively scarce. It was instead a commodity that might be considered a luxury, but which was nonetheless essential to daily life \xe2\x80\x93 sugar.

[(24:57)](#!):

Now I’m not going to go into too much detail on the cause of this shortage, since, if I ever actually complete the French Revolution, we will be talking about it at length. Because back in 1791, there had been a major slave uprising on the key sugar-producing colony of Saint-Domingue. So in January and February 1792, sugar shortages in Paris led to demonstrations organized by the leaders of the radical sections. Then in April, these radical leaders successfully organized a mass gathering in support of the soldiers who had been locked up for their role in the Nasti Mutiny, which we talked about back in episode 3.17. The political climate had obviously changed quite a bit since August 1790, and the mutineers were released from prison and paraded as heroes through the streets of Paris on April 15, as part of the patriotic run-up to war.

[(25:49)](#!):

So when the king purged the Girondin ministry in mid-June, the radical sections of Paris already had a full head of steam. Fueled also, of course, are the sudden bad news from the front and Briseau’s conspiratorial rhetoric about counter-revolutionary aristocrats plotting their collective downfall.

[(26:07)](#!):

Then this head of steam was further fueled by an open letter from Lafayette that arrived in Paris on June 18. Lafayette announced that the internal unity of France was threatened not by some secret Austrian committee, but rather by demagogues using seditious political clubs as platforms to attack the constitution. He advised the legislative assembly to immediately shut down the Jacobin Club and the Kordeljie Club. This, of course, did nothing but confirm everyone’s belief that Lafayette was a traitor to the revolution.

[(26:39)](#!):

The final bit of fuel was heaped on by the king on June 19, when he went ahead and vetoed both the law on deporting non-juring priests and the law calling in the 20,000 national guardsmen to Paris. So June 20, 1792 was, conveniently enough, the third anniversary of the tennis court oath, and the radical leaders of Paris used it as an excuse to call for a mass meeting outside the Tuileries Palace, ostensibly to plant a commemorative liberty pole in the Tuileries Garden.

[(27:13)](#!):

That morning, tens of thousands showed up outside the palace to make their displeasure with the king known. It was at this rally that the revolution also begins to hear the first prominent assertions that the sans-culottes\xe2\x80\x94that is, those workers and artisans who did not wear the fancy knee breeches\xe2\x80\x94were not only an independent political force all their own, but that they were a superior political force. That the distinction between active and passive citizens should not be abolished, it should be reversed. The will of the true people of France should dominate\xe2\x80\x94all aristocratic, culotte-wearing swine should be swept aside.

[(27:53)](#!):

The demonstration of June 20 was organized to be a peaceful one. Yes, the mob was armed, and yes, the mob was intimidating, but intimidating was all they wanted to be for the moment. They first pushed their way into the legislative assembly and presented a petition calling for an investigation of the king’s treason against the nation\xe2\x80\x94specifically, his alleged undermining of the war effort. The petition concluded that if the king was found guilty, that he had to be removed from power. Then they went off and pushed their way into the royal apartments themselves\xe2\x80\x94the national guardsmen on duty simply let them pass. Knowing that there was nothing he could do to stop them, Louis ordered the doors to his private chamber opened, and in came the rabble.

[(28:40)](#!):

For the next two hours, Louis put on a brave face as these thousands of lowly wretches filed past to get a look at him, and maybe hurl an insult or two. When a red liberty cap was thrust in his direction, the king prudently put it on. When a glass of wine was thrust in his hand, he raised it and drank to the nation. But though these symbolic gestures helped sort of win the people over. He also pointedly declared his continued faith in the constitution and that he had no intention of reinstating the dismissed Girondin ministry.

[(29:13)](#!):

Eventually, the mayor of Paris, P\xc3\xa9tion, whose sympathies clearly lay with the mob but who decided he should probably do something to restore order, arrived on the scene, mounted a chair, and convinced everyone to disperse. The demonstration of June the 20th was ominous, and not a little bit surreal, but it failed to achieve its immediate objective. The king would not reverse any of his vetoes, and he would not reinstate the dismissed ministers.

[(29:43)](#!):

Then, in the medium term, it actually did quite a bit to damage the revolutionary cause, or at least the revolutionary cause as seen from the perspective of the emerging Saint-Culotte. Because once the rest of the nation got word that the mobs of Paris were trying to dictate national policy by means of foul language and general smelliness, moderate provincials would sympathize with the king, and start wondering why so much power was concentrated in Paris, where foul-mouthed, smelly mobs could wield such disproportionate influence.

[(30:15)](#!):

This would combine with other grievances particular to each department, paving the way for a general breakdown of political harmony between the center and the periphery of the nation, and then lead to out-and-out civil war. In the long term, though, the events of June the 20th fit neatly into the straight line leading directly to the subject of next week’s episode, the Great Insurrection of August the 10th, an insurrection that might plausibly be called the Second French Revolution, because next week we will see a similar mob of radical Parisians rise up, overthrow the monarchy, and declare France a republic.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.23, The Insurrection of August 10th.

[(01:60)](#!):

Last time, we saw the profound impact that France’s declaration of war had on domestic politics. So far, the revolution had played out against a backdrop of peace. Yes, fears about the intentions of the Austrians had long played a role in how the revolutionaries thought and acted. But until now, it had all been theoretical. So while the clashes between the various political factions were heated, they were never dangerous. But with the war off to a bad start, and victory no longer confidently guaranteed, suddenly a mortal threat was aiming straight at the very heart of the revolution. Failure now meant extermination at the hands of a foreign enemy. It meant the loss of everything. The fear inside Paris that the Austrians and Prussians would soon be marching into the capital magnified the willingness of everyone to see enemies everywhere and then do whatever it took to survive. It is going to get very vicious and very bloody from here on out.

[(02:57)](#!):

Now the bad start to the war, though, does raise a point that I did not sufficiently return to last week. I mentioned in passing that after General Dillon’s vanguard turned tail that the Austrians were not yet in a position to respond. And it’s true, they really weren’t. But then I hopped back to Paris and carried on with the story all the way through the demonstration of June the 20th without ever returning to the frontier. So what was happening back out on the front through May and June? Surely something must have been going on. But no, nothing much to speak of.

[(03:31)](#!):

Now the reason for French inaction is obvious. Its commanders were convinced their armies were in no shape to go on the offensive. However the top generals, Rochambeau, Lafayette, and Lochner, even went so far as to advise the legislative assembly to sue for peace before the weakness of the French armies was fully exploited.

[(03:49)](#!):

But that doesn’t explain Prussian and Austrian inaction. What does explain their inaction was that they were not feeling the slightest bit of urgency about any of this. This war was going to be easy once it got going, so there was no need to rush into things. So the Allied Prussian and Austrian armies took their sweet time getting ready. And oh by the way, I’m about to start using the Allies and Allied armies as a synonym for the Austrians and Prussians, be aware. But through May and June, the Allies coordinated their staffs, they discussed how the invasion of France would proceed, and they put troops into position.

[(04:25)](#!):

And they pretty much went about it like they had all the time in the world. The only risk was in moving so fast that they made a mistake. So carefully, deliberately, and methodically, they got ready to invade, with an eye on crossing the border in early August. That is, if the French hadn’t given up yet.

[(04:44)](#!):

Meanwhile, back in Paris, there was nothing careful, deliberate, or methodical about anything that is about to happen. Fear had gripped the capital. Rumors swirled in tight, vicious circles. The generals are about to lay down their arms. The Prussians are on the move. The Austrians will be here any moment. The king is planning a coup. The mobs are planning to rise up. The effect of these swirling fears were accusations and counter-accusations about what the greatest threat to France really was, who was to blame for what, and what we should do now.

[(05:18)](#!):

The sudden mob demonstration of June the 20th only further fractured domestic unity. The radical leaders in Paris believed the king was an enemy. The generals, traitors, the monarchy itself a threat to the nation. Inside the legislative assembly, the Girondins were now officially nervous about those mobs. Sure, the demonstration of June the 20th had been organized in part to get their guys reappointed to the ministry. Sure, they didn’t like the king. And no, they didn’t much like the aristocratic generals either. But mob anarchy? No thank you.

[(05:50)](#!):

Meanwhile, those aristocratic generals out on the front were acutely aware that the weakness of the French army was real, and believed France was threatened by radicals and demagogues who had no idea what the situation was out on the front, and just wanted to blame everyone else for their own misguided rush to war. That last bit, for example, was the considered opinion of Lafayette, who is now approaching the end of his revolutionary career. But in the aftermath of June the 20th, Lafayette saw one last opportunity to take center stage and maybe save both the revolution and the nation.

[(06:28)](#!):

His primary concern was the growing power of the radical mobs in Paris, and the deluded warmongers in the legislative assembly who were demanding too much from the super-shaky French armies. After those armies stumbled out of the gate, and Brissot went into conspiracy overdrive, Lafayette started coming round to the idea that the capital might have to be pacified by force.

[(06:51)](#!):

To this end, he even sent feelers out to the Austrians asking if they maybe wouldn’t mind holding off their offensive if it turned out that he needed to march his army into Paris. After all, if they were really interested in securing the safety of the royal family, it would absolutely be in their best interest to let him go. Once the monarchy was saved, Lafayette could come back to the front and the war could commence as planned, if the war was even still necessary. Lafayette also signaled his displeasure with the situation to the Parisians themselves when he sent that letter to the legislative assembly demanding that they suppress seditious political clubs.

[(07:28)](#!):

Then, when he got word of the events of June the 20th, just a few days after he sent that letter, he decided the time had come to act. He left the front and rode for Paris to hopefully take control of the situation before things got out of hand. Savior of the revolution. That has a nice ring to it.

[(07:46)](#!):

But when Lafayette appeared before the legislative assembly on June the 28th, he discovered just how little influence he had left. He demanded the leaders of the June 20th demonstration be punished, and then repeated his call for the suppression of the Jacobin Club and the Cordell Yee Club. This was greeted not by rousing cheers or even stony silence, it was instead greeted by catcalling, and demands to know why exactly he had abandoned his post in the middle of a war. Basically, what are you doing here? Get out of here.

[(08:17)](#!):

Shaken, Lafayette left the legislative assembly and tried for an audience with the royal family. But the king and queen refused to see him because at this point they absolutely hated Lafayette’s guts, believing him to be a traitor to his class, who had proudly served as their jailer after convincing them to abandon Versailles. Getting a little worried now, Lafayette reached out to his old comrades in the Parisian National Guard. He had, after all, been their first commander. He had organized their companies, designed their uniforms. Surely they must, but they too told him to take a hike. We don’t take orders from you anymore.

[(08:53)](#!):

Far from being the hero everyone was begging for, Lafayette discovered he was now little more than a disgraced villain. If he had really been planning the coup, so many of his enemies accused him of planning. Now would have been a good time to order his army to move on Paris. But Lafayette hadn’t thought that far ahead. His troops weren’t sitting around waiting for that order, and he maybe wasn’t bold enough to take that last step anyway. He was, after all, a political idealist, not a ruthless cynic. Lafayette quietly returned to the front to mope.

[(09:26)](#!):

After the insurrection of August the 10th, which we’ll be getting to here in a moment, it will be made very clear to Lafayette that remaining in France would now be hazardous to his health. After the legislative assembly yelled at Lafayette to get back to his post, they went back to trying to solve the problem Lafayette had thought he was the answer to\xe2\x80\x94how to salvage the deteriorating political situation. The June 20th demonstration had forced everyone to take sides in a domestic squabble right at the moment a foreign threat loomed out on the frontier.

[(09:59)](#!):

As I said at the end of last week’s episode, the abuse of King Louis by the mobs of Paris had been abhorrent to a lot of people. Petitions of solidarity with the king started coming in from the provinces demanding the same thing Lafayette had just demanded\xe2\x80\x94that the organizers of June the 20th be punished. The governing board of the Department of Paris\xe2\x80\x94that is, the department within which the commune of Paris was legally nested\xe2\x80\x94took action on July the 6th and removed Paris mayor P\xc3\xa9tion from power for his role in abetting, and or failing to contain, the demonstration.

[(10:32)](#!):

The delegates of the legislative assembly were mostly in agreement with all this, but they were pretty unsure now of what they could do about it. They were not insensible to the fact that they were a little island smack dab in the middle of Saint-Culotville, and who knows what they’ll do to us if they decide that we are a part of the problem. But if they were worried about losing control of the situation, the legislative assembly then made a few decisions that all but guaranteed they would lose control of the situation.

[(11:01)](#!):

First, they decided to ignore the king’s veto of the order calling in the 20,000 national guardsmen into Paris. They skirted the issue by simply keeping open the invitation to the provincial national guard units to come attend the third Feast of the Federation on July the 14th. Because of this direct connection to the Feast of the Federation, the companies that accepted the invitation, and who would soon play a central role in the insurrection of August the 10th, have been collectively dubbed by history the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9.

[(11:32)](#!):

Then, on July the 5th, the legislative assembly passed the famous law on the country in danger that if invoked would send all legislative and administrative bodies into permanent session, and then grant those bodies emergency powers beyond what the Constitution technically allowed. While the legislative assembly sowed these seeds that they would soon come to deeply regret, they also launched a sustained attack on the king’s ministry. Since the demonstration of June the 20th had failed to convince the king to ditch his new ministry and recall the gyrandins to power, the legislative assembly, coordinating with the Jacobin Club, decided to heap all kinds of abuse on the newly appointed ministers themselves. No doubt acutely self-conscious of their own role as mere pawns in a bigger game, the oh-so-recently appointed ministers collectively resigned on July the 10th, so the executive branch of government was now all but headless.

[(12:29)](#!):

The next day, a dispatch came in from the frontier saying that the Prussians were finally moving into attack position. So on July the 11th, the legislative assembly invoked the law declaring the country in danger. They called for 50,000 new volunteers to join the army, and authorized all local National Guard units to be dispatched at once to the front. Mayor Petillon was put back in office to redirect energy that had been building to have his removal from power reversed. So this state of emergency, then, was the backdrop for the third Feast of the Federation. The first had been a mass rally of national unity. The second had been a subdued affair, mostly defined by the collective realization that no one was really satisfied with the status quo. The third, on July the 14th, 1792, was said to have been as big and well-attended as the first, but there was something deeply menacing about the show. Those National Guard units, those federae, that had accepted the invitation to attend were in many cases even more radicalized than the radicalized sections of Paris. These guys, after all, had been out on the front lines battling counter-revolutionary plots back home. Plots, they believed, were being actively assisted by the royal family.

[(13:47)](#!):

So the third Feast of the Federation wasn’t about patriotic unity. It was about the potential for patriotic action. And it didn’t take long for formal planning of that patriotic action to get underway. Shortly after the feast, the Jacobin Club started to turn away from their long-standing defense of constitutional monarchy. Robespierre, who had been quietly biding his time while Brissot and the Girondins took control of his beloved Jacobin Club and then drove it into a war he opposed, now flanked them on the left and came out in favor of ditching the Constitution of 1791. So the Girondins were now losing their grip on things everywhere. I mean, they had wanted their men reappointed to the Royal Ministry, not see the Royal Ministry abolished. But they were unable to stop a Jacobin petition from being issued on July 23, calling for an end to the monarchy.

[(14:45)](#!):

Since it was now becoming dangerous to defend the monarchy publicly, Brissot and the Girondins opened secret negotiations with the king to figure out what they could do to preserve the Constitution. This secret correspondence is not going to look good at all when the Girondins get dragged before a hostile revolutionary tribunal after things really go off the rails next year. Nor, frankly, did it do much to preserve the Constitution of 1791, which is about to get chucked into the dustbin of history. Compounding this loss of control, the national emergency the legislative assembly had just declared allowed the various assemblies of the Paris sections to sit in permanent session, giving the radicals an institutional base from which to organize that direct patriotic action. And it was at this moment that Georges Danton stepped back into the limelight and drove events into what, as I said last week, might plausibly be called the Second French Revolution.

[(15:50)](#!):

When last we left Danton, he had slipped out of Paris following the massacre of the Champs de Mars, and taken a well-advised vacation to England. He was able to safely return just a few months later, though, when a general amnesty was declared at the closing of the National Assembly in September 1791. He then stood for a seat in the new legislative assembly, but with his public reputation still a little bit singed, he was unable to win a seat.

[(16:17)](#!):

Despite this setback, he was still a highly visible figure both in the streets and in the Jacobin Club, but as Brissot and the Girondins stirred up war fever, Danton joined Robespierre in the very unpopular opposition to that war. He had looked on approvingly then as the sugar shortages began to re-stir up the people of Paris, but he opposed the demonstration of June the 20th as a counterproductive exercise that only generated sympathy for Louis. After June the 20th, however, Danton decided the time had finally come to do something very productive, and he started actively planning to overthrow the French monarchy. A very patriotic action indeed.

[(17:01)](#!):

From his base in the Courtelier district, Danton made the rounds to the Paris sections, and urged them to start ignoring the distinction between active and passive citizens. Everyone should be admitted to all proceedings. The poorer assemblies wasted no time, and soon their meetings were teeming with sans-culottes \xe2\x80\x94 workers, artisans, apprentices, shopkeepers, none of them happy, all of them ready to do something about it.

[(17:27)](#!):

On July the 27th, Danton then helped organize a coordinating committee that would start holding regular meetings in the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville to, well, coordinate the activities of the Paris sections, the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 National Guard companies, and allied political clubs \xe2\x80\x94 including, of course, the Jacobins, who were represented on the committee by Robespierre. Many of the better-off sections of Paris declined to send representatives, which meant that the coordinating committee was free of all moderation or doubt. What exactly they were coordinating for was still a closely-held secret, but it wasn’t too hard to guess.

[(18:06)](#!):

The day after the coordinating committee was established, a bomb was dropped on Paris that sealed the fate of the French monarchy. From his headquarters just beyond the border, the allied commander-in-chief, the Duke of Brunswick, issued the instantly infamous Brunswick Manifesto. This manifesto declared the war aims of Austria and Prussia \xe2\x80\x94 to end the anarchy in France, to stop attacks on the king and on the Catholic Church, to re-establish to the king all his sovereign authority. And then it got to the juicy bits. If anyone in Paris decided to harm even a single hair on the king’s head, the violence visited upon the Parisians collectively would be quote exemplary.

[(18:53)](#!):

Clearly, Austria and Prussia had decided to learn nothing from the counterproductive results of their previous tough talk, because once again, this direct threat only galvanized the French into mass resistance and led directly to the overthrow of the monarchy it was ostensibly trying to protect. After the manifesto landed in Paris on July 28, events moved very quickly. On July 30, the legislative assembly passed an order that passive citizens would now be allowed to join the National Guard, and that all patriotic citizens should do so at once. Then that same day, a 500-man company of National Guardsmen arrived from Marseille.

[(19:35)](#!):

Now the men from Marseille turned out to be a particularly eager munch. Their home city down on the Mediterranean coast had become something of a regional hub for patriotic revolutionaries, and its citizens had appointed themselves defenders of the revolution in the southeast. They sent armed units to help the annexationist seize control of Avignon. Then they identified the nearby city of Arles as the center of counter-revolutionary activity, and sent out a 6,000-man expeditionary force to lay siege to Arles and expel its leaders.

[(20:08)](#!):

Over the spring of 1792, the Patriots in Marseille egged on outbreaks of pro-revolutionary violence, much of it playing out as a more overtly political version of the upheavals of the Great Fear, with aristocratic estates targeted and ransacked.

[(20:24)](#!):

So the 500 men from Marseille who arrived in Paris on July 30 were absolutely ready to take this fight to the next level. And when they came into the capital, they came in singing a new patriotic anthem that had been written by an army officer stationed out on the Rhine just a few months earlier. The song had quickly spread, and when the Marseille company arrived in Paris, they came in singing it proudly, which is how the song wound up getting called La Marseillaise, better known right now as the French national anthem, with its chorus, To arms, citizens, form your battalions, Let’s march, let’s march, Let impure blood water our furrows.

[(21:08)](#!):

Now when ultra-patriot f\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9e like the Marseille company arrived in Paris, they pointedly did not put themselves at the disposal of the official Paris Commune government, but instead pledged their loyalty to Danton’s coordinating committee. With a growing army at its command, the coordinating committee now began to wield more practical power than the official Paris Commune government. And it wasn’t long before the power of the committee began to rival the legislative assembly itself, which had been backed into an uncomfortable defense of the constitution of 1791. When, on August 3, Mayor P\xc3\xa9tion presented the assembly with a petition demanding the overthrow of the monarchy, the legislative assembly refused to consider it. And indeed, Brissot and the Girondins spent most of the first week of August giving speech after speech opposing any violent move on the king. Though, of course, they were not of one mind about this. More than a few of them could see the writing on the wall, and were afraid that if they didn’t back the Paris sections, that they would be swept out with the monarchy that they themselves had no particular love for.

[(22:17)](#!):

But the legislative assembly, as a body, had more or less decided to oppose what Danton and his coordinating committee were trying to force them to do. When, for example, the delegates came under intense pressure to impeach the damned traitor Lafayette, they debated the case on August 8 and then refused. The next day, they finally agreed to discuss whether or not to suspend the king, but after debating the matter for a few hours, the legislative assembly adjourned without coming to a firm conclusion.

[(22:49)](#!):

At this point, Danton and his associates concluded that the legislative assembly was beyond hope, and the coordinating committee met in an all-night session, at the end of which they declared themselves now to be the Insurrectionary Commune. Then, just before dawn on August 10, 1792, they set about seizing control of Paris. First, the old Commune government was expelled from the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville. Well, expelled isn’t really the right word, mostly they just didn’t show up for work if they knew what was good for them. Then the Insurrectionary Commune, already controlling most of the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 companies, declared themselves in control of the Parisian National Guard. Most of those companies accepted the declaration willingly, though not all would go over immediately. Indeed, once the toxin bell started ringing, signaling the beginning of the Insurrection, the commander of the Parisian companies, a guy named Monda, rushed around blocking up the bridges across the Seine to prevent mobs from the two sides of the city from linking up. Then he went down to the Tuileries Palace to lend what help he could to the rapid fortifications being erected to defend the palace grounds.

[(23:60)](#!):

When Danton learned that Monda was taking orders from the King, not the Insurrectionary Commune, he ordered the National Guard commander to come at once to the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville to explain himself. Monda resisted for a few hours, but eventually decided he could maybe forestall an armed confrontation if he went and made his case. But when he got to the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, he was hauled in front of Danton, who bawled him out for insubordination, and then ordered the now clearly ex-commander of the Paris National Guard thrown in prison. But the unfortunate Monda never made it to prison. As soon as he was outside, one of his more patriotic escorts shot him in the head with a pistol.

[(24:43)](#!):

Back at the Tuileries, the royal family waited nervously for the hammer to drop. The palace grounds were defended by about 2,000 National Guard, a couple hundred random courtiers, and regular army officers, and then 900 Swiss mercenaries.

[(24:58)](#!):

King Louis flirted briefly with the idea of leading the defense of the palace personally, but he was persuaded that that was a really bad idea, and that he and his family should take formal asylum within the Legislative Assembly, who had gathered for a nervous session composed of the few hundred delegates willing to make some kind of public demonstration that they were, in fact, still a thing. So at about 9 a.m., the royal family crossed the courtyard to the Legislative Assembly and were placed in a small room where their safety could at least be reasonably hoped for. It would be the last free act of their lives. About two hours later, the forces of the insurrectionary commune had finally cleared the bridges, gathered in one great mass, and arrived at the palace gates. They were at least 20,000 strong by now, and at their head was no longer scruffy artisans or angry fishwives, but trained soldiers, and at the head of the head was that particularly eager company of National Guardsmen from Marseilles.

[(26:01)](#!):

Now what happens next is a bit confused, not just to us, but to the people at the time. What we do know is that the National Guard inside the palace immediately defected to the mob. Then it seems like there was a back and forth that led some in the crowd to believe that the Swiss and the leftover courtiers were going to stand down and let them in. So when the gates opened and they poured in, it came as quite a shock when the Swiss guards suddenly opened fire. It reminded the angry mob of nothing so much as the betrayal at the fall of the Bastille, when a similar mob rushed into a similar courtyard and was similarly shot at. Now why the Swiss fired, whether it was by accident or by design, is a mystery, but the reaction of the mob was not. They started shooting back, and a heated firefight engulfed the Tuileries. From his hiding place inside the legislative assembly, the King issued an order for the Swiss to stand down, but there was no way to get them that order. Inevitably the vastly outnumbered Swiss were forced to fall back, and when they did, the mob surged forward and just overwhelmed them. No quarter was offered. The Swiss guards were engulfed by an angry nightmare of Saint-Qulot, bearing knives and daggers and pikes, which they used to hack the guards to death. The explicit details of all this are actually quite a bit more gruesome than you might even be picturing, and I’m not going to go into it, but the bloody frenzy was soon out of control. It took hours to track down and kill the last few stragglers who had gone into hiding inside the palace. In total, about 600 of the Swiss guards were killed either in the initial fighting or the subsequent massacre. About 300 from the Patriot mob lay dead alongside them.

[(27:51)](#!):

Inside the legislative assembly, the delegates who remained at their posts did what they could to placate the mob. They voted immediately to suspend the king. Then they declared that elections would be held immediately for a new national convention. The task of that convention would be to drop a new constitution for France, because as of this moment, the constitution of 1791 is dead as a doornail. Crucially, elections to the new national convention would be held on the basis of universal manhood suffrage. No more of this active, passive citizen baloney, because those citizens out there don’t seem very passive to me.

[(28:30)](#!):

The royal family was then transferred under close guard to the temple, a medieval fortress on the outskirts of Paris, where they would remain until the convention could come to a final conclusion about their fate. The legislative assembly then pressed on as best they could. Though the king was personally suspended, the royal ministry still technically existed, and so they voted to reappoint all the ousted gyrandins to their previous posts. But to this new ministry, they added one new member, and that one new member actually got more votes than anyone. Georges Danton, by nearly unanimous acclimation, was appointed minister of justice.

[(29:13)](#!):

But after the blood and smoke of August the 10th cleared, it would soon become clear to everyone that neither the legislative assembly nor the new ministry wielded any real power. Real power now lay in the insurrectionary commune, who had just overthrown the national government and seized control of not just Paris, but all of France.

[(29:36)](#!):

Oddly enough, we’re now 50 episodes into revolutions, and this is practically the first fully realized revolutionary act of the series. As we’ve seen, most of the revolutionary acts of the English, American, and French revolutions have been backed into accidentally. I mean, nobody planned to overthrow Charles I. Certainly no one planned to put him to death. And even then, all the subsequent experiments with republican government were more or less improvised in the moment.

[(30:07)](#!):

Republican independence was stumbled into by everyone. It was all but unthinkable until the moment the Second Continental Congress looked around and was like, yeah, okay, I guess we’d better do it. We have, after all, been at war for like a year now. And now here in the French Revolution, all the big moments\xe2\x80\x94the tennis court oath, the fall of the Bastille, the women’s march on Versailles\xe2\x80\x94were all spontaneous reactions to events. The insurrection of August the 10th, though, was planned. It was organized. It was armed. It had a revolutionary purpose. And when it was launched, it violently and successfully seized power.

[(30:45)](#!):

In the future, all aspiring revolutionaries would of course study the events of the French Revolution with great interest. But the clever ones did not look to the Revolution of 1789 for inspiration and guidance, but rather to the Revolution of 1792. And it should come as no surprise that Lenin thought Danton the greatest master of revolutionary tactics yet known. Next week, we will deal with the fallout from this second French Revolution. The insurrectionary Commune will now be calling the shots, backed by an intimidating street army that was done coddling the counterrevolutionary enemies of France.

[(31:26)](#!):

The Allied armies will finally cross the frontier, and begin what will look to both sides like a steady and irresistible march on Paris. This will lead to a reaction in Paris that will make Brissot’s paranoid rhetoric about secret conspiracies seem downright restrained. Because now that the mobs were running Paris, words alone would not be enough. Which is how we will get to the shocking brutality of the September massacres.

So I’ve just had an epiphany about audiobooks, maybe even a revelation. I can’t believe it hasn’t occurred to me before. There is absolutely nothing like an audiobook to help keep you moving through ultra-dense or ultra-convoluted prose that you might get lost in if you tried to sit and read it. So with that in mind, I decided to download a mainstay of my life reading list that was in danger of never getting crossed out, The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. And guys, it’s great. And there’s no chance that my eyes were going to get heavy trying to plod my way through whole paragraphs on labor theory that deploy but a single period.

[(01:22)](#!):

So Wealth of Nations I heartily recommend if you’re looking to better understand the economic underpinnings of like the whole world. But the next book you look to download, think about picking up one of those dense masterpieces you always wanted to read but they just seem too daunting to tackle. And when you’re done with this episode, go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash revolutions so that they know who sent you. Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.24, The September Massacres.

[(02:08)](#!):

So last week we witnessed a massive turning point in the French Revolution, a massive turning point in world history. The insurrectionary commune, backed by an army of militant sans-culottes and ultra-patriotic national guardsmen, violently seized control of Paris on August the 10th, 1792. The king was now suspended, the royal family in prison. And though it wasn’t yet official, this insurrection had just brought an end to a thousand-year-old monarchy. And for the men who successfully pulled it off, that was hopefully just the beginning.

[(02:41)](#!):

And it was just the beginning. That wasn’t necessarily a good thing. Because this second French Revolution is about to open the door for all the worst excesses we think of when we think of the French Revolution. And today, the revolutionaries will officially set out on the bloody road that will lead them all to the reign of terror.

[(03:02)](#!):

In the days after August the 10th, power was shared haphazardly by three institutions. First, the insurrectionary commune, who had just seized control of Paris by force. Second, the legislative assembly, who were trying to put on a brave face, but who surely recognized that they had just been rendered impotent. And finally, a new thing called the provisional executive council. This six-man council was essentially the restored Girondin royal ministry, plus Danton as minister of justice. But because the entire constitutional order had just been overturned, it was difficult to tell who had authority over what.

[(03:40)](#!):

But in those first few days, it became clear that the legislative assembly was now taking its orders from the insurrectionary commune. That is, if they knew what was good for them. So under pressure from the radical Parisians, the legislative assembly passed a law granting municipalities the right to arrest anyone they thought suspicious for any reason. Then the assembly appointed commissioners to head out into the departments to make sure that the provincials understood that August the 10th meant that there was a new sheriff in town, and that anyone who didn’t like it, or who was suspected of supporting the now suspended king, or who just happened to make a joke at the wrong time, faced arrest or worse. These commissioners also spread the word that new elections would commence in a few weeks to elect a national convention, whose job it would be to write a constitution that reflected true revolutionary principles, and that in keeping with those principles, every man would be allowed to vote.

[(04:37)](#!):

Back in the capital, the legislative assembly then took no steps to halt the suppression of royalist leaning newspapers. Conservative editors were arrested and their presses seized by armed units under the direction of the insurrectionary commune, because the revolutionary principle of freedom of speech could not possibly apply to men who advocated counter-revolution.

[(04:58)](#!):

While the legislative assembly deferred to the will of the commune, the Provisional Executive Council deferred to the will of new Minister of Justice Danton. If any one man could be said to be in control in these chaotic days after the second French Revolution, it was Danton. The insurrectionary commune was basically his creation, the Saint-Culot out in the streets hailed him as their champion, and the legislative assembly had just given him more votes than any other member of the Provisional Council. So it was not surprising that Danton, now all of 32 years old, found himself the most powerful man in Paris.

[(05:36)](#!):

But most powerful does not mean all powerful. Danton was not some dictator, not by a long shot. He simply radiated a bit more authority than any other man in the city. Yielding to this radiant authority, the legislative assembly appointed Danton’s close confidants, Camille de Moulin and Fabre d’Eglantine, to be his official secretaries, and then they voted the Justice Minister 550,000 livre to go attend to his duties.

[(06:05)](#!):

Danton and his friends then started spending this money right away, mostly to build up a network of spies and informants to quickly root out all the internal enemies of France before they could form a fifth column to aid the about-to-invade Allied armies. Just to foreshadow a little bit, though, the liberal spending of all this money, the inadequate receipts kept, and the elevation of d’Eglantine to a position of official power would all come back to haunt Danton. But for the moment, he had things to do, money to pay for it, and trusted friends to help him get it done.

[(06:40)](#!):

After the insurrection, Danton himself was pretty much forward-looking. That is, what can we do to prepare Paris to defend itself from the Austrians and Prussians? But his sans-culottes friends out in the streets, and their representatives in the Paris sections and the insurrectionary commune, were stuck looking backward. Specifically, they wanted revenge on all those who had spilled patriot blood on August 10th. So that meant the few Swiss guards left alive, and a few other random army officers and court functionaries who had been taken into custody.

[(07:12)](#!):

The whole insurrection was now being cast as a necessary response to some vaguely defined royalist conspiracy, and the conspirators had to be punished. But more generally, the sans-culottes now demanded all the revolution’s enemies be hunted down and locked up, reserving particular wrath for non-juring priests who had abused the leniency with which they had been treated to foment counter-revolution. It was time for that leniency to end. So under pressure from the sections, the legislative assembly decreed that a new new civic oath must be taken immediately to distinguish the patriotic clergy from the traitorous clergy.

[(07:52)](#!):

And finally, there was one guy above all who the sans-culottes singled out for intense hatred, the Marquis de Lafayette, aka the Butcher of the Champs de Mars. The Parisians wanted his head on a platter, and they wanted it right now. Danton himself personally loathed Lafayette, and so he wasted no time obliging his people. On August 14, a warrant was issued for Lafayette’s arrest.

[(08:22)](#!):

Out on the frontier, Lafayette was tipped off about the warrant, and knowing full well that if he gave himself up, he would likely be put on trial and executed, he did the prudent thing. Accompanied by a few loyal officers, he packed his bags, and on August 17, he crossed the lines into the Austrian Netherlands.

[(08:41)](#!):

Now since the start of the war, the French officers who deserted across the lines had, for the most part, been allowed to pass through Austrian territory unmolested. I mean, it made sense to encourage defections. So Lafayette’s plan was to find a port and sail to the United States, where his adoptive countrymen would welcome him with open arms, unlike his actual countrymen, who were now trying to cut his head off.

[(09:06)](#!):

But when Lafayette’s party encountered another French emigre officer attached to the Austrian army, the emigre recognized Lafayette, and Lafayette was in way too deep with the revolution to just be allowed to pass like some disgruntled second lieutenant. Lafayette was taken into custody, declared a prisoner of state by a military tribunal, and then transferred to an old fortress run by the Prussians.

[(09:30)](#!):

He would remain in Prussian custody until May 1794, when he was handed back over to the Austrians, who would then keep him locked up until Napoleon negotiated his release in the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, which we’ll get to roughly 147 episodes from now.

[(09:48)](#!):

During Lafayette’s captivity, emissaries from the United States tried to get him released, but they lacked the standing to pull it off. They did, however, do him one signal favor. Congress passed a bill granting Lafayette full back pay for his six-year service as a general in the Continental Army, a bill quickly signed by Lafayette’s surrogate father and now president of the United States, George Washington. And that money is what Lafayette would live on during his five years in prison.

[(10:19)](#!):

The same day, Lafayette slipped over the lines, August 17th. The legislative assembly gave in to further pressure from Paris and established an extraordinary tribunal to prosecute those who had committed counter-revolutionary crimes on August 10th. A few days later, this tribunal handed down its first guilty verdict, and administrative secretary of the Paris National Guard was sentenced to death for his role in the alleged royalist conspiracy. His execution on August 21st would have been unremarkable were it not for the method of his execution.

[(10:53)](#!):

Because that’s right my friends, it’s time to finally introduce one of the most famous characters of the French Revolution, Madame La Guillotine. The unfortunate secretary of the Paris National Guard holds the distinction of being the first political prisoner executed with the guillotine, and oh boy, will he not be the last.

[(11:14)](#!):

Now as some of you may know, the guillotine, or as it was initially called, the machine, was conceived as an instrument of humanitarian reform. Capital punishment in the bad old days was a brutal process. Criminals were hanged, broken on the wheel, drawn and quartered. So as the waves of reform washed over France in those idealistic days of 1789, eminent physician and National Assembly delegate Dr. Joseph-Inn\xc3\xa8s Guillotine proposed all executions be carried out by a new device he had invented, a device I’m sure you’re all familiar with so there’s no need to describe how it works in detail.

[(11:54)](#!):

The benefits of Guillotine’s machine were twofold. First it would end needless and frankly barbaric suffering inflicted on the condemned. Second it would bring a measure of equality to the process of executions. In the new era ushered in by the Declaration of the Rights of Man, why should nobles alone enjoy the privilege of having their heads chopped off? But the National Assembly never moved on the proposal, and Guillotine shelved his plans for the machine.

[(12:23)](#!):

After the Legislative Assembly convened in 1791, however, radicals in the Jacobin Club started agitating again for the idea that every condemned citizen should die in the same way. That is, if they weren’t as radical as Robespierre, who wanted to abolish capital punishment altogether.

[(12:42)](#!):

So these radicals started working on a plan to extend the privilege of beheading to everyone. But nervous Paris executioners explained that beheading someone took precision and concentration, and if the lines got long, the quality of their work might suffer, and if the quality of their work suffered, who knew how much the condemned would suffer. So the plans for Dr. Guillotine’s machine were dusted off and problem solved.

[(13:08)](#!):

In April 1792, just as war fever was hitting a fever pitch, the Legislative Assembly took time out of its day to order a piano maker to build a prototype of Guillotine’s machine. Once the prototype proved effective on corpses, it was handed over to the executioners of Paris. On April 25th, a convicted highwayman became the first official victim of La Guillotine. Everyone in the crowd that day agreed it was a major letdown. Usually they got to watch the victim flail around for a bit. But this was all zip, thud, the end. What is the fun in that?

[(13:48)](#!):

So getting back to it, although the extraordinary tribunal had just found a royalist conspirator guilty and executed him, and would, over the next few weeks, find more men guilty and execute them, the pace of their work was far too slow for the liking of the sans-culottes. And these hungry lower classes of Paris were fed red meat by that friend of the people, Jean-Paul Marat.

[(14:13)](#!):

Now up until this point, Marat had been regarded by Danton’s inner circle of the courtly leadership as a crank to be tolerated. His angry screeds were lively, and certainly directed at the right people, but they also never circulated widely enough to really be a problem. So the leaders of the courtly indulged and protected Marat.

[(14:34)](#!):

But after August the 10th, Marat suddenly became the voice of the Parisian sans-culottes, and his circulation skyrocketed. He seemed to be the only man willing to say what they were all trying to say, there are enemies in our midst, and they must be destroyed before we are destroyed. Marat really came into his own after August the 10th, and the articles he wrote left little to the imagination. The enemies of the revolution should be rounded up and killed. France must be cleansed if she was going to be saved. Marat was no longer a fringe crank, he was now a murderous force to be reckoned with.

[(15:15)](#!):

In the midst of all this, really really bad news started coming in on the war front. On August the 19th, the allied army of Prussians, Austrians, and French emigres led by the Duke of Brunswick finally launched their invasion, and took the fortress at Loie without a fight. Word of this got back to the capital on August the 26th, sparking a new round of paranoid fears that the French army was full of traitors, happily clearing the allies a path to Paris, and that Paris was full of traitors, ready to hand over the keys to the city once they arrived.

[(15:49)](#!):

The legislative assembly immediately gave all non-juring priests two weeks to either take the new new civic oath, or leave the country. After that, if they were caught, they would be deported to Guiana. But of course, these days, no one was allowed to leave Paris without a passport, and those passports were issued by the Paris sections, so you can imagine how many non-juring priests strolled into the sectional assemblies to ask for said passport. So while the city slowly locked down, and the enemies of the state were locked in, Marat howled for counter-revolutionary blood, and the pressure inside Paris began to grow unbearable.

[(16:32)](#!):

With the capital now seriously threatened by the allied army, there was some loose talk, specifically from interior minister Rolan, that the revolutionary leadership should withdraw from Paris to avoid being captured by the enemy. But Danton would have absolutely none of this, and on that point, he and Jacques-Pierre Brissot agreed. They would die before they ran.

[(16:56)](#!):

To organize a defense of the city, Danton organized a systematic search of Paris, ostensibly to look for guns, ammunition, or able-bodied men who could be used to fight the approaching allied army. But that was really just the pretext fed to the legislative assembly to get them to approve the house searches. Really, it was about barging into homes and rounding up anybody who was suspect, knew someone who was suspect, or had the same name as someone who was suspect.

[(17:25)](#!):

On August 30th and 31st, armed companies started banging down doors and hauling out suspects. In all, about 3,000 were rounded up and shoved into the various Paris prisons, all of which were now badly overcrowded. What to do with these prisoners became a topic of heated discussion, but the direction things were headed became clear when the insurrectionary commune appointed Jean-Paul Marat to serve on its committee of surveillance, a committee that had jurisdiction over the prisons. After agreeing with Danton about not abandoning the capital, Brissot then tried to pivot and reassert the overarching authority of the legislative assembly.

[(18:09)](#!):

He engineered a vote demanding the Paris commune hold new elections to replace the likely illegal insurrectionary commune. But of course, the insurrectionary commune ignored this order. Well, they didn’t just ignore the order. They used it as proof that the faction from Gironde, as Robespierre was just now dubbing them, were themselves suspect. Why was Brissot trying to dissolve the commune? Why had Roland just advocated abandoning the people of Paris to the enemy?

[(18:41)](#!):

But before this movement to arrest the Girondin leadership picked up too much momentum, Danton appears to have stepped in to squash it, likely saving, at least for the moment, all of their lives. He also probably saved the life of Talleyrand, who came around one day asking if maybe he couldn’t get one of those passports out of the city. Despite having just rendered his most revolutionary service yet, drafting a defense of the August 10th insurrection that would be transmitted to the courts of Europe, Talleyrand could see that at the moment Paris was no place for anyone connected to the church or the nobility, and he was connected to both.

[(19:21)](#!):

Danton, who liked and respected Talleyrand, wrote out a passport in his own hand, and Talleyrand managed to duck out of Paris one day before the September massacres began. Through all of this, the Allies continued their methodical advance on Paris. Danton had already called for 30,000 men to stand up and go fight them, but he was having difficulty convincing volunteers to leave the city. The Saint-Qulot were ready to answer the call, eager to answer the call. But there was a problem. All those recently apprehended prisoners were dangerous.

[(19:59)](#!):

General belief was that the minute the volunteers walked out of Paris, the prisoners would be able to break out of jail and attack the defenseless families that the volunteers left behind. We simply cannot allow our women and children to fall into the hands of the evil counter-revolutionary swine. So the debate about what to do with the prisoners got even more urgent. Then early on September 2, everything came to a head when word arrived \xe2\x80\x93 premature as it turned out, but not by much \xe2\x80\x93 that the fortress at Verdun had fallen. The fortress at Verdun was the last fortress standing between the Allies and Paris.

[(20:40)](#!):

When this terrible news landed, Danton took to the floor of the Legislative Assembly and refused to be anything but heroic, defiant, and fearless. He gave a rousing and completely improvised speech, culminating with the call to stand and not shrink before the danger. The toxin bell which is about to sound is not a signal of alarm, he thundered. It is a call to charge upon the enemies of the country. To vanquish them, gentlemen, we must be bold and bolder still and forever bold, and France will be saved.

[(21:15)](#!):

The speech gave Paris the energetic boost it probably needed to survive, but it also meant that the time to act was now. We have to go fight now. And that is when the terrible solution to the problem of the prisoners unfolded.

[(21:32)](#!):

At two in the afternoon on September the 2nd, a group of about 20 prisoners were being transferred in an open cart from the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville to the Abbey Saint-Germain, now the main political prison in Paris. That little convoy was soon set upon by an angry mob of Saint-Qulot. The mob dragged the prisoners off the cart. A few of these unfortunate souls were spared, but the rest were killed on the spot.

[(21:59)](#!):

Later that day, another armed band broke into a Carmelite monastery that had been transformed into a prison. This time the angry mob set up a little kangaroo court to dispense the people’s justice. One by one, prisoners were brought forward and accused, convicted, and sentenced all in one breath. Then they were pushed towards a group of Saint-Qulot armed with pikes, sabers, daggers, and clubs who proceeded to just gang murder the condemned. Next prisoner. After these initial outbursts, the Commune then stepped in to restore order.

[(22:34)](#!):

But that did not mean halting the executions. That meant organizing them and making them more systematic. The Committee of Surveillance and its now leading light, Jean-Paul Marat, ensured that the people’s justice would be swift and bloody and uncompromising. The men who did the killing would be voted wages for their good work. Once the Commune took over the process, the rest of the Paris prisons were pushed into, and ad hoc tribunals were convened to judge those held inside. Those judged were usually found guilty and killed immediately, though if you can believe it, there were a few acquittals.

[(23:13)](#!):

This horrifying brand of justice continued unabated for the next five days before tapering off for lack of further victims on September the 7th. In all, somewhere between 1100 and 1600 were executed. That included men, women, and children. Yes, children. In one prison the executed included kids as young as 12 and 13 years old.

[(23:38)](#!):

Among the dead were 200 non-juring priests, all the remaining Swiss guards, and man, you gotta feel for those guys, survive one frenzied massacre, sit around in jail for a month just to get killed in another more systematic massacre, yeesh, as well as a handful of aristocrats who had been swept up in the recent house raids. These last included Princess Lombard, one of the Queen’s best friends, who had been with the royal family on the long night of August the 9th. The tribunal the princess faced demanded she swear allegiance to France and then swear a hatred for monarchy in general and the royal family in particular. She said she would do the former, but could not do the latter, so they pushed her into an alleyway where the waiting murder gang stabbed her to death, hacked off her head, and paraded it down to the temple so the Queen could get a good look.

[(24:32)](#!):

And in case you’re wondering, the royal family themselves escaped the September massacres, but only because when an armed soldier burst into their quarters, Louis dressed the soldier down and ordered him to get the hell out of there. A lifetime of deference to the sovereign was apparently a hard habit to break, and the royal family was spared\xe2\x80\xa6 for the moment. The majority of those killed in the September massacres, however, were simply common criminals who had been arrested at a really, really bad time.

[(25:02)](#!):

So what political crime could they be guilty of? Well, the tribunal settled on this. Their bad character and rotten circumstances would make them easy tools for the evil counter-revolutionaries to employ in their evil counter-revolutionary work. And so, those common criminals, too, had to die.

[(25:23)](#!):

As the tribunals wound down, one last massacre was staged on September the 9th, as a group of prisoners was being transferred down to Paris from Versailles. This group included former members of the National Assembly, now suspected of being counter-revolutionaries, as well as Antoine de la Sartre. Remember him? The hapless foreign minister who was impeached by the Legislative Assembly for not being sufficiently tough with the Austrians? Well he had been held in custody ever since, and was now among those being brought down from Versailles.

[(25:54)](#!):

Along the way, the officer in charge of the convoy simply stopped short, and wouldn’t you know it, a whole group of armed Parisians were waiting to greet them. They cut every prisoner’s throat, and left the bodies littered on the ground. The response to the September massacres among the respectable bourgeois revolutionaries was complete silence. Whatever their own personal feelings, no one made a move to stop it.

[(26:21)](#!):

Now it’s hard to tell what level of involvement anyone played in orchestrating the massacres, because in the aftermath, everyone blamed everyone else for being in on it. Brissot and the Girondins would accuse Robespierre of masterminding the slaughter, in the hopes of getting Brissot and the Girondins sucked into the wood chipper. Robespierre would in turn make counter-accusations blaming the Girondins. Of course everyone believed Danton had to be involved somehow, because as justice minister he just seemed to be inescapably guilty. Madame Roland certainly thought he was the puppet master behind the whole thing.

[(26:56)](#!):

But Danton’s crime appears to have been merely to do nothing to stop it. To consciously sacrifice the prisoners to the Paris streets as an unfortunate but necessary part of maintaining patriotic unity and getting the sans-culottes ready to go fight the looming allied army. If the price to be paid for saving the revolution was the death of treasonous priests, mercenary Swiss, counter-revolutionary aristocrats, and common criminals, was that really so high a price to pay? Danton made it clear he did not think so.

[(27:31)](#!):

In the aftermath of the slaughter though, Danton was proved right about one thing. The prison massacres freed the sans-culottes from any fear they had about marching to the front, and 20,000 quickly volunteered to heed the new toxin bell and go charge upon the enemies of the country. And there was no time to lose. An army of 35,000 Prussians and Austrians and the hated emigres was aiming right for them, and nothing, it seemed, could stop them. But then, suddenly, before the new recruits could even get out there, that army was not only stopped, it was turned around.

[(28:09)](#!):

Okay, so the last time we checked up on the front lines, there were three French armies out there in the field, but none of the generals thought their armies were in any shape to fight. But since then, there had been a few changes at the top.

[(28:24)](#!):

I wrote a whole thing trying to explain the game of musical chairs that occupied the French high command in the summer of 1792, detailing who went where when, and then why they were moved again, but I decided going through all the details would probably make this less comprehensible, not more comprehensible. So the bottom line is that after Lafayette skipped town back in August, ex-Minister of War and rabid Austrian hater Charles Francois Dumouriez took command of the Army of the North. A guy named Francois Kellerman, a career officer born in France but into an ethnically German family, he was promoted to command the Army of the Centre, and the Prussian-born Nicholas Luckner still commanded the Army of the Rhine.

[(29:10)](#!):

After taking command of the North, Dumouriez had been planning to relaunch the invasion of the Austrian Netherlands as the surest way to force the Allied army to leave France. But with L’Ouil and Verdun falling so quickly, he had to break off preparations and rush down to try to put something between the Allies and Paris. He ordered Kellerman’s army to rendezvous with him at Saint-Menu, a town which was, well, and I suppose still is, just about 200 kilometers from Paris. Dumouriez then lined up his army running north-south along the main road to Paris to block Brunswick who was coming in from the east.

[(29:48)](#!):

But Brunswick managed to swing north and scramble up the French left wing, which forced Dumouriez to pull them back, pivoting the direction of his entire line. So now, he had the French lined up running east-west, watching the Allies march past them to the north. Now at this point, Brunswick could have easily bypassed the French army and plunged towards Paris. But that would have cut off his supply and communication lines, and he didn’t like the thought of his army being isolated so deep in French territory, especially with a bout of dysentery sweeping through his camp.

[(30:25)](#!):

Kellerman showed up the next day to reinforce the French army, and Dumouriez put him in charge of the left. Kellerman took up this command on September the 20th, just as Brunswick was deciding to wheel his army around in a big flanking maneuver to come in at the French from the west. This led Kellerman to advance his own forces towards some high ground near the small village of Valmy, and that is where the two armies met.

[(30:50)](#!):

Now crazily, of course, when the two sides faced each other, the Allies were the ones standing between the French and Paris, instead of the other way around. Which is a bit reminiscent of the early days of the First English Civil War, when the royalist army of Charles I kept winding up between the parliamentary army and London, even though the parliamentary army was supposed to be out there to stop Charles from reaching London.

[(31:14)](#!):

So in a miserable reign, the Allied and French armies stared at each other for a little bit at Valmy and then decided to settle into an artillery duel to see if the other side would run off. But as it turns out, at this point in history the French ran the best artillery schools in Europe, and Kellerman’s veteran artillery officers pounded the Allies with more precision than the Allies managed to pound the French.

[(31:39)](#!):

But what really surprised the hell out of everyone was that the French troops did not break and run when the shells started falling. Indeed, after a little while it looked like the ultra-professional Prussians were the ones ready to crack. Continuing to pour on the artillery, Kellerman then started waving his hat, crying, Viva la naci\xc3\xb3n, and all his troops took up the cheer. And for whatever combination of reasons, the rain, the dysentery, the sight of surprisingly solid French infantrymen cheering and singing, Brunswick ordered his men to retreat from the field.

[(32:13)](#!):

And then to the massive shock of just about everyone, he ordered them to march back the way they came, away from Paris, back east toward the frontier. Brunswick was withdrawing the Allied army from France. So just like that, the seemingly inevitable sack of Paris was called off. It should come as no surprise that even the radical anti-clericals in the capital had no trouble describing the Battle of Valmy as a miracle, and no one doubted it was one of the greatest victories in French history.

[(32:46)](#!):

But of course, it really wasn’t. It was barely a skirmish. And clearly, had he wanted to, Brunswick could have forced another battle somewhere else if he just didn’t like the high ground Kellerman had secured at Valmy. So what gives? How did this light artillery skirmish lead to the total withdrawal of the Allied army from France? The answer is, no one quite knows.

[(33:11)](#!):

We know the Allied troops were wracked by dysentery. We know that they expected this to be a cakewalk, and indeed it had been. But it also appears they really didn’t like all those Frenchmen cheering and singing together while getting blasted with artillery. It was unsettling. The commanders also knew that tens of thousands of French reinforcements were on the way. Now the utterly outraged French \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s could not explain it any other way than to assert that Brunswick had been bribed by revolutionary agents who offered him the Bourbon family jewels in exchange for retreating. I mean, what other explanation could there be?

[(33:50)](#!):

Now what role or partial role any of these factors played in the decision to withdraw is ultimately speculation. We don’t have a good answer, although the bribery charge does seem paper thin.

[(34:02)](#!):

But then of course there was one other thing. There was Poland. That’s right, Poland. While the Prussians and Austrians were preparing to invade France, Catherine the Great moved her armies into Poland, and the Poles had surrendered, probably prematurely. The Prussian king Frederick William II did not like the idea of the Russian armies milling around in his now clearly under-defended backyard, so he decided that if the invasion of France was going to take even one minute longer than anticipated, that he needed the hell out of there. And it looked like it might now indeed take more than one minute longer. So he wanted his guys the hell out of there.

[(34:42)](#!):

So maybe it was for this reason. Maybe it was for all those other reasons. But whatever it was, the Allies were now in retreat, and Paris was saved. The great and miraculous victory Valmy on September 20, 1792 just so happened to coincide with the opening of the next great political phase of the French Revolution, because the very next day the newly elected National Convention replaced the now-defunct Legislative Assembly in the menage of the Tuileries Palace.

[(35:16)](#!):

Next week we will introduce the Convention, which will become the battleground within which and over which those worst excesses of the French Revolution will now play out. But next week is going to be insanely busy for me on the home front, so next week’s episode might be a bit shorter than usual. But my plan is at a minimum to get the National Convention off the ground.

[(35:41)](#!):

Finally, I’m going to end with an enormous and heartfelt thank you to all of you who supported the fundraiser. It was a huge success. We sold 2,060 shirts, 1,590 copies of the five-sided cross, and a good number of books from the History of Rome Library. Now no one bit at the pick-a-revolution-any revolution, but I’ve got an idea about that for next time.

[(36:08)](#!):

So, the big bulk t-shirt order is now being processed. I’m not sure of the exact timeline of when everything will be approved, printed, and then start shipping, but if you’ve been waiting patiently for your shirt, you will hopefully be getting an email confirmation about shipping soon. Thank you all very, very much. I’m not going anywhere.

[(01:54)](#!):

So last time, we dealt with the bloody consequences of the power vacuum that was left after the insurrection of August the 10th. The overthrow of the monarchy and the abandonment of the Constitution of 1791 meant that no one was really in charge, and so no one was really in control.

[(02:12)](#!):

But this dangerous six-week interregnum ended with the convening of the National Convention. The National Convention’s stated purpose was to write a new constitution for France, but as events twisted and turned and constitutions were written, suspended, and rewritten, the convention wound up serving as the national legislative body of France from September 1792 until November 1795. The battles waged in the convention and over the convention would define the worst days of the French Revolution, and today, we will follow the bitter and acrimonious start to their violent and disturbing adventure.

[(02:54)](#!):

Elections for the new convention were called by the Legislative Assembly in that nervous session of August the 10th, 1792. The leadership of the Legislative Assembly may not have been ecstatic about dumping the Constitution of 1791 and starting over from scratch, but with the smoke from the battle in the Tuileries Palace still lingering in the air, they decided it was one of those go-along-to-get-along type of situations. But though Brissot and his Girondin friends no doubt shuddered when they approved elections that were to be held on the basis of universal manhood suffrage, accepting only servants and the unemployed, they did manage to sneak through two bits of procedure minutiae that helped ease the pain. First, they stuck with the same two-tiered electoral system that had been used in the past, a primary assembly to nominate an elector who would then move on to a second assembly where the vote for the actual delegates would take place. This would hopefully lock out the kind of delegate unregulated democracy might produce. Second, they managed to resist Robespierre’s call that the Legislative Assembly pass a self-denying decree as the National Assembly had once done, a decree that would bar them all from sitting in the convention.

[(04:08)](#!):

But the leaders of the Legislative Assembly were having none of that. They were not going to be swept aside like those naive fouillon. If the electoral pool was going to be universal, so too would the candidate pool.

[(04:21)](#!):

The first round of elections was held on August the 27th, which was just about the time Paris was entering terminal freakout mode, but it wasn’t just Paris that was freaking out. There was a lot of freaking out going on. Those commissioners sent out by the Legislative Assembly after August the 10th made it clear that this was the dawn of a new era, and in this new era, enemies of the revolution would no longer be coddled. Decrees started coming out of Paris authorizing the arrest of suspects, and then that extraordinary tribunal gave everyone a look at what justice would look like in this new era when they started cutting off heads with the guillotine.

[(04:59)](#!):

Which, while I’m here, I had better correct something right now. As a few of you pointed out, Dr. Guillotine did not invent the guillotine. He merely suggested that all execution should be decapitation, effected by means of a simple machine. Forerunners of that simple machine had been around for a few hundred years, but the prototype built in April 1792 is officially credited to a surgeon named Antoine Louis. Dr. Guillotine’s name wound up attached to the thing, though, much to his everlasting shame and horror. Sure don’t like making mistakes like that, but every once in a while I faceplant. I’m sorry about that.

[(05:35)](#!):

So the elections to the National Convention unfolded under an oppressive blanket of fear and suspicion. So it should come as no surprise that in an atmosphere where the wrong political sentiment, even when expressed offhand, might result in the death penalty, that turnout for the elections was comically low. You never see turnout figures for the primary assemblies higher than 25%, and I’ve seen them calculated as low as just 5%. Why in the world would you want to accidentally vote for the wrong guy at a time like this?

[(06:06)](#!):

That meant that those who did show up were of a very particular type and agreed on a very specific set of principles, which is why it’s so ironic that of the three major representative bodies we’ve dealt with so far, the National Assembly, the Legislative Assembly, and now the National Convention, the convention would turn out to be by far the most rancorous and faction-ridden. The second round of elections was held on September the 2nd, the same day the September massacres got going in Paris. Now obviously that couldn’t affect the vote out in the departments, but it had a huge impact on the Paris elections. I mean, you would have to be insane to show up and do anything but vote left, left, and harder left.

[(06:48)](#!):

As a consequence, the Paris delegation would be super-crazy radical. Even more super-crazy radical than all the previous Paris delegations, and those previous delegations had always been way to the left of everyone. When the results came back in, the Paris slate read like a who’s who of major revolutionaries. Robespierre, Danton, Desmoulas, Deglantine, Jean-Paul Marat won a seat. But so too did their increasingly bitter opponent, Jean-Pierre Brissot, who was still way too prominent and influential to be denied.

[(07:20)](#!):

Out in the departments, meanwhile, about 200 men who had sat in the Legislative Assembly were re-elected from their various districts, including all the prominent Girondins. Also coming back into the fold were about 80 guys who had served in the old National Assembly, the most famous of whom was the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans, that renegade Prince of the Blood, who was now styling himself Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9.

[(07:44)](#!):

Regrettably, I have probably not given the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans the attention he deserves, and at some point I’m going to have to pull off and review his role in the revolution at better length, since he was so instrumental in creating the space within which the early revolutionaries flourished, and I’ll probably do that when those revolutionaries cut off his head.

[(08:05)](#!):

So of the 749 members of the convention, almost 300 were experienced legislators and had been central to revolutionary politics for years. The newcomers were, like had happened with the Legislative Assembly, men who had made their name in local revolutionary politics and who were now making the jump to the big stage, although one of the most famous newcomers had made his name not in local politics, but in international politics, because our old friend Thomas Paine was elected to represent the city of Calais. Paine had just been chased out of Britain for publishing a defense of the French Revolution called the Rights of Man, and he landed in France, just in time to be elected as a sort of honorary delegate by some enthusiastic French admirers.

[(08:49)](#!):

The public debate that had just been waged in London between the radical Paine and the suddenly very conservative Edmund Burke probably deserves a supplemental episode all its own, because the French Revolution is insanely complicated and it’s very hard to keep up. The convention met as a body for the first time on September the 20th in the Tuileries Palace, and then on September the 21st, 1792, they held their first session in the Menage, taking over that rectangular hall that had served as the home of both the National Assembly and the Legislative Assembly.

[(09:23)](#!):

From the word go, the National Convention was a very, very contentious place to be, because two factions walked into the hall, basically ready to drive the other into the dust. Robespierre, his fellow Paris radicals, and about 130 Jacobin-aligned delegates planted themselves on the top rows of a set of steep risers on one side of the hall. This earned them the nickname that would become an all-but-official party name, the Montagnards, or the Mountain, and I am going to call them the Mountain, so I don’t have to mangle Montagnards every time I want to talk about them.

[(09:60)](#!):

Opposed to the Mountain was, of course, the Girondins, now numbering roughly 200 or so delegates who tended to vote together and support each other, though it is an enduring historical debate just how cohesive they really were. Between these two factions lay the majority of uncommitted delegates who filled the seats near the ground, earning them the name the Plain, or the Swamp, if you wanted to be snarky about it. Their votes were the prize to be won in the endless rounds of accusations and counter-accusations between the Mountain and the Girondins.

[(10:34)](#!):

Now, the funny thing about these two rival cliques is that in almost every respect they were composed of the same type of man. They were all well-educated, mostly lawyers and professionals, thoroughly of the bourgeois set. Most had grown up obscure in the provinces, and had risen to prominence with the Revolution. They all were, or had very recently, been prominent Jacobins, and those who had been in the National Assembly or the Legislative Assembly always composed the left side of the left wing.

[(11:02)](#!):

So far, they had really only disagreed about one thing, but I suppose it was a big thing. Briseaux and the Girondins were extremely pro-war. Robespierre and his allies were staunchly anti-war. The rest of it comes down to personality. They just didn’t like each other. And then there was, of course, power. They both wanted it, and saw the other as their main obstacle to grabbing it and holding it.

[(11:30)](#!):

In the beginning, the Girondins clearly had the edge on that power. And in a lot of ways, their position at the beginning of the Convention was very similar to that of the Foullons at the beginning of the Legislative Assembly. The Girondins controlled almost all the important ministerial posts, their immediate numbers gave them the largest plurality of votes in the Menage, and the new delegates arriving in Paris to take their seats initially gravitated into their orbit.

[(11:56)](#!):

For the first few months, the Girondins were able to put their guys in the President’s chair almost at will. In a convenient bit of dramatic foreshadowing, though, it appears that when the delegates arrived to take up their seats in the Menage, no one wanted to sit in the area once occupied by those disgraced Foullons, like those seats were cursed or something. But then the realities of space constraints forced those seats to be occupied by the Girondins. Cue ominous music.

[(12:29)](#!):

The big thing that gave the Girondins their immediate gravitational claim on new delegates was the shock over the September massacres. Most of the provincial delegates were absolutely horrified by the massacres. Including the body count from August the 10th, more than 2,000 enemies of the Revolution had been killed in the capital by armed mobs in less than six weeks.

[(12:51)](#!):

Aside from the human suffering dimension, most of the delegates in the Convention were lawyers, and they were appalled by the total breakdown of the rule of law. So right away, the delegation from Paris came under fire for their role in the massacres. It was well understood that Robespierre and his gang were closely tied to the insurrectionary Commune, that in a very real sense, they were the representatives of the Commune in the Convention. That set them up as villains through these initial sessions.

[(13:21)](#!):

In a very pointed rebuke of the Commune, the first President the Convention elected was Jerome Petillon, the now ex-mayor of Paris, who had been deposed when the insurrectionary Commune took power on August the 10th. The first order of business, however, did manage to bring everyone together. On September the 21st, the Convention voted unanimously to abolish the monarchy and declare France a republic. A new, kingless constitution would now be drafted.

[(13:52)](#!):

This was just about the last thing the Convention agreed on. Because once it was settled that the monarchy was abolished, the next question became, okay, well, what do we do with Louis? And that’s when unanimity collapsed. Some wanted him put on trial. Others said he’d already been put on trial and found guilty back on August the 10th. Others said a king could never be put on trial. Some people wanted him dead. Other people wanted him in prison. Others maybe secretly wanted him back on the throne.

[(14:22)](#!):

All of this would be the primary focus of the first few months of the Convention. And today, I’m going to talk about none of it. Instead, I’m going to reserve it all for next week so I can tell in one coherent story the trial and execution of Louis the Last. Today, we’re just going to have a little fun watching the Girondins and the mountain go at it to the nail.

[(14:47)](#!):

The Girondins moved quickly to try to destroy the mountain before they even got settled. In that first week, they accused Robespierre of orchestrating the September Massacre so he could kill all his enemies and set himself up as a dictator. Their main tactic was to link Robespierre to Marat because everyone knew Marat had been the main instigator of the massacres and had been repeatedly calling for a revolutionary dictatorship to purge France of the impure.

[(15:15)](#!):

The Girondins then pivoted from this personal attack on Robespierre into a general assault on the Paris Commune which they argued posed a potential threat to the Convention. Any time something didn’t go the Commune’s way, they could simply unleash the armed hordes of Saint-Culotte. To counter this, they proposed calling in National Guard units from the provinces to come act as defenders of the Convention.

[(15:40)](#!):

But this initial attack petered out when Marat stood up and declared that he had been alone in his call for a revolutionary dictatorship. Robespierre had nothing to do with it. And then, of course, there was the somewhat perplexed reaction to all this from the unaligned delegates of the plain who thought attacking Robespierre and the Commune a curious business to fixate on given everything else that had to be done. But the Girondins were not deterred and Robespierre was not their only enemy and they soon set their sights on Danton, that great ogre that Madame Roland was absolutely convinced was really behind the massacres, the man who really wanted to set himself up as a dictator.

[(16:20)](#!):

Danton’s position within the Convention was a bit odd. He sat with the Mountain, but he very much wanted to remain independent and he worked behind the scenes to mend the rift between the two factions. They had so much in common it seemed crazy to derail the Convention for the sake of indulging personal grudges. To counter the notion that he himself was aiming at dictatorship, Danton announced in his maiden speech to the House that he would resign from his post as Minister of Justice, a promise he kept two weeks later once he was sure that the victory at Valmy had actually turned the Allied army around.

[(16:56)](#!):

But that was not enough for Madame Roland and in mid-October the Girondins started going after Danton hard for his sloppy bookkeeping as Minister of Justice. He had spent a lot of money and no one knew where it had gone, though it was clear at least a chunk of it had gone to arm the Paris sections, which didn’t exactly seem like justice ministry business.

[(17:20)](#!):

But while the vast majority of the money was publicly unaccounted for, Danton plausibly made his case that given the circumstances he had spent the money as he thought best to defend Paris, that he had shown his receipts to his colleagues on the Provisional Executive Council and that they had approved his work, which his fellow ministers then affirmed that he had. Though, as I said, in the days after August 10th Danton dominated that ministry, so who knows what actually went on or what his fellow ministers actually approved.

[(17:54)](#!):

All of these attacks culminated at the end of October, in the beginning of November, when the Girondins attempted to expel the entire Paris delegation as a threat to the Convention. On October 25th they sent out one of their guys, a minor character whose name I won’t bother you with, to reopen the case against Robespierre. The model of the speech was Cicero’s Catiline orations, and he again accused Robespierre of trying to set himself up as a dictator.

[(18:22)](#!):

But when Robespierre came back a week later with his defense, he absolutely won over the plane. He dismissed the entire thrust of the Girondin attack as both stupid and petty. He laughed at the thought of anyone thinking him, of all people, anything but an instrument of virtue. He then laid out what would soon become the official revolutionary position on the September massacres, that they were inextricably linked to the insurrection of August 10th, that they were driven by the same historical force, that to deny one was to deny the other. And since no one wanted to turn back the clock on August 10th, everyone had to accept the massacres as the unfortunate result of the same virtuous impulses.

[(19:06)](#!):

It had all been illegal, of course it had been illegal, but it was the will of the people, and that was what mattered. Do you want a revolution, he asked, without a revolution? But all this bickering was really just a sideshow to the main event, because over this first month of the convention’s life, committees were being formed and then started reporting back about how best to deal with the king. Next week, we will be back at full strength with a full-length episode to delve into the trial and execution of Louis XVI, whose fate would soon enough be shared by those who currently judged him.

## 3.26- The Trial of Louis XVI

 [(00:01)](#!):

This week’s episode is brought to you by Casper. Casper is an online retailer offering premium mattresses for a fraction of the price. The mattress industry has, for a very long time, forced consumers into paying notoriously high markups with resellers and showrooms all taking their cut along the way. Casper is revolutionizing the system by offering obsessively engineered mattresses at a shockingly fair price.

[(00:31)](#!):

Made in America, these mattresses combine two technologies, latex foam and memory foam, that provide just the right sink and just the right bounce, and come together for better nights and brighter days. By cutting out all the middlemen, you can get a twin for $500, or a king for just $950, and if you’ve ever gone out mattress shopping, you know those are some pretty outstanding prices. On top of that, this is all risk-free. You can try sleeping on a Casper for 100 days, and if for some crazy reason you don’t like it, you can just return it and pay nothing.

[(01:09)](#!):

I of course now have a Casper mattress of my own, and the whole family approves. Mrs. Revolutions and I have slept great, and the boy has put it through a fairly rigorous product testing program that involves jumping onto it, jumping off of it, and then just sort of jumping around on it, and he couldn’t be happier about this fun new toy that just showed up on his doorstep one day. So if you want a better mattress and you want to pay a fair price, go to casper.com forward slash revolutions and use the promo code revolutions. That will get you 50 bucks off any mattress you want. That again is casper.com slash revolutions promo code revolutions.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions Episode 3.26 The Trial of Louis XVI When the National Convention convened in September 1792, it was ostensibly meeting for one single purpose. Write a new constitution for France.

[(02:24)](#!):

But writing that constitution was absolutely not the first priority for the convention delegates when they arrived. No, the first priority was deciding what to do about the king. As we saw last time, the convention voted in its very first session to abolish the monarchy, but that did not solve the problem of what to do with Louis the Man, who had been held captive since the insurrection of August the 10th. For the first four months of the convention, the debate over the king dominated the agenda, and that debate would help sharpen the political lines that would divide revolutionary France in the bloody months to come.

[(03:01)](#!):

Now luckily for the delegates of the convention, they were allowed to turn the fate of the king into a factional struggle for power without fear of foreign invasion. I’m going to double back on the war front next week because today I want to focus exclusively on the death of the king, but just know that after the miraculous victory at Valmy turned the Allied armies around, General Dumourieu put the French army in motion, invaded the Austrian Netherlands, and successfully overran the territory. We’ll talk about all the details next week, but all that good news from the front meant that there was plenty of room for the Girondins and the Mountain to try to destroy each other.

[(03:39)](#!):

After the insurrection of August the 10th, Louis and his family had been transferred to the Temple, a fortress on the outskirts of Paris so-called because it had been built by the Knights Templar back in the 1200s. Though he was mostly well treated, his guards were encouraged to treat him with studious contempt and to knock him off his lofty royal perch, they started referring to him as Citizen Louis Capet, assigning him the family name of Hugh Capet, the long, long ago founder of the Capetian dynasty, of which the Bourbons were a descended branch. Louis hated it.

[(04:14)](#!):

Once the Tuileries Palace was vacated, a hastily organized committee of representatives from the insurrectionary Commune, the various Paris sections, and the soon-to-be-defunct Legislative Assembly started combing through the royal apartments, collecting every piece of paper they could find, searching for definitive proof of the treason they all knew Louis Capet had been engaged in. This committee began a preliminary survey of the King’s papers, quickly finding evidence that Louis had not only been in regular contact with the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, but that he had sent them money to boot. The bulk of the work of sifting through the papers, though, would be left for the coming national convention.

[(04:53)](#!):

Now as we saw last time, after the convention voted unanimously to abolish the monarchy, the Girondins then hijacked the agenda for the rest of that first week in an attempt to tear down Robespierre and his allies in the mountain for their alleged role in the September massacres. To help change the subject, Robespierre’s friends in the Commune announced that they had just discovered evidence in the seized documents that Louis had been making regular payments to close to 200 delegates of the Legislative Assembly, no doubt bribes meant to muddy the pure waters of revolutionary government. The mountain used this revelation to demand an end to the scurrilous attacks on Robespierre so that the convention could move on to the far more important business of the King’s fate, which they further argued ought to be swift execution for treason.

[(05:42)](#!):

But the vast majority of the convention delegates were not ready to move that swiftly, and a committee was appointed to take over the seized evidence, sift through the contents, and report back. As the Girondins had already placed their men in all the key administrative posts of the convention, this committee was not surprisingly chaired and staffed by Girondin allies. The evidence committee then came back with a report on October the 4th, announcing that after an initial scan of the documents, it was clear that the King had been up to some shady stuff, and we’ll get back to you with a more detailed report. No deadline was set for that second, more detailed report.

[(06:19)](#!):

And so right away, the battle lines between the Mountain and the Girondins was drawn. Both sides agreed that the King was guilty of treason. Everyone in the convention believed the King was guilty of treason. I mean, it was practically a prerequisite to getting elected to the convention in the first place. So the real dividing line was about what to do next. The Mountain, as we’ve just seen, wanted to execute the King for his crimes without further delay. For the revolution to live, the King must die.

[(06:47)](#!):

The Girondins, however, were already now doing everything in their power to stall, delay, and avoid executing the King. Now there was never any coherent or universally held rationale for sparing the King among the Girondins. Just a vague sense that the revolution would have more options if Louis was kept alive. Mostly though, it seems like it came down to the fact that the convention was fast ascending into a power struggle between the Girondins and the Mountain. And if the Mountain said hot, the Girondins said cold. If the Mountain said up, the Girondins said down. So with the Mountain saying kill the King now, the Girondins had to say, hold on, let’s talk about this.

[(07:29)](#!):

The first big battle fought along these lines was whether the King deserved a trial. Did he deserve a chance to respond to the accusations against him, see the evidence, publicly defend himself? Sticking to their hard line, Robespierre and the Mountain said no. The King had already faced his trial on August the 10th and he had lost. All that was left for the convention to do was dole out the punishment. The Girondins meanwhile argued that some kind of trial was necessary if for no other reason than to make it look like what we’re up to is legally legit. As I said last time, well over half the delegates were lawyers and they were not at all comfortable with the arbitrary justice advocated by the Mountain. So they were sympathetic to the argument for holding a trial.

[(08:14)](#!):

But there was a huge problem. There was no precedent for trying a King. Strictly speaking, you couldn’t try a King. The Constitution of 1791 was explicit that the King had sovereign immunity and was thus sacred and inviolable. So though the delegates wanted to maintain the rule of law, it was clear that somebody was going to have to do some pretty fancy thinking to get around the insurmountable hurdles to bringing Louis to trial. And even if you cleared those hurdles, who would even have jurisdiction? Who would prosecute? Who would sit in judgment?

[(08:49)](#!):

To settle these questions, the convention appointed a lawyer from Toulouse named Jean-Baptiste Mayle to chair a committee to investigate what procedures and rationales might guide the convention. Mayle was one of those re-elected members from the legislative assembly, and though he was on good terms with the Girondins, he was independent enough to avoid getting swept up in the coming purges. Ordered to figure this thing out, Mayle then spent the rest of October doing some pretty fancy thinking.

[(09:19)](#!):

It was while the convention waited for Mayle’s report that most of the stuff we talked about last week played out \xe2\x80\x94 the attacks on Danton’s bookkeeping, and then the further attacks on Robespierre and Marat and the rest of the Mountain. This round of fighting culminated with Robespierre’s speech on November 5th, and that was the speech we ended with last week, when he asked in fierce exasperation, do you want a revolution without a revolution? In response to Robespierre’s rhetorical triumph, the Girondins pushed their evidence committee to make their second report, and hopefully that would keep up the momentum for a trial rather than allowing Robespierre to lead the convention into killing the king and killing him now.

[(09:59)](#!):

But that second report only served to undercut the Girondin case further. It was vague, it revealed nothing new, and just kind of made it look like the committee hadn’t actually been doing much of anything to dig up final proof of Louis’s crimes. But just as the delegates were starting to get restless, the Mayle committee came back with its report, which put the case for a trial back on track.

[(10:24)](#!):

Mayle argued that Louis’s immunity had been given to him by the people, who were the true sovereigns of France, and could thus be revoked by them at will. As the convention represented the sovereign will of the people, they could go ahead and revoke the king’s alleged immunity at any time. So that got them over that hurdle. Mayle’s report then went on to outline the way forward. Louis obviously couldn’t be tried by a regular court of law, but he could be tried by the convention itself. So he advised the delegates to draw up a list of accusations, present those accusations to the king, allow Louis to see the evidence against him, and have an attorney appointed to help him build a defense. Then after the king had presented that defense, the convention should hold an open roll call vote on his guilt.

[(11:13)](#!):

The structure of Mayle’s proposed trial was of course totally improvised, and had no basis on any existing criminal code. But to most of the delegates, it felt legal-ish enough to get the job done. But with this proposal now on the table, two big arguments against holding a trial emerged, though they were proposed for very different reasons.

[(11:35)](#!):

The first came from a guy who was basically a closet royalist. He said, look, there is a clause in the constitution of 1791 that deals with high crimes committed by the king. There were in fact three such crimes explicitly enumerated, refusing to swear to uphold the constitution, leading a foreign army against France, and fleeing the country. And even if Louis were found guilty of any one of those, you could just skip to the bottom and see that the prescribed punishment was forced abdication. Period. That was it. And Louis had already been forced to abdicate, so what is a trial going to accomplish? It was then, and remains now, a very fair point.

[(12:17)](#!):

To respond to this argument, the Mountain sent down the youngest member of the convention to make his debut performance in the French Revolution, 25-year-old Louis-Antoine de Saint-Juste, soon enough to be known as the Angel of Death, for reasons that will become clear in the episodes to come.

[(12:35)](#!):

Saint-Juste had been born in 1767 to a retired cavalry officer. His father died when he was 10, but his mother managed to scrape together enough money to send her young son off to a good school. But as Saint-Juste grew up, a few things became clear. He was super smart, super handsome, and super egotistical. He was flippant, arrogant, and just did not believe the rules applied to him. Basically, the epitome of the obnoxious teenager every adult utterly despises. When he was 19 and possibly heartbroken over losing a woman to another man, Saint-Juste stole all his mother’s silver and two pistols and disappeared off to Paris. The police managed to track him down, and he was stuck in a reformatory for six months.

[(13:23)](#!):

After getting out, he briefly studied law, but it didn’t take. Instead, he decided that he was a literary genius. In 1789, he published a long satirical poem that brazenly attacked just about every key institution of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime\xe2\x80\x94the monarchy, the church, the aristocracy\xe2\x80\x94and those sustained attacks were broken up only by scenes of graphic pornography, because of course they were. It turned out, though, that Saint-Juste was not a literary genius. When censors caught wind of the poem and set to work tracking down copies to confiscate, they had trouble finding any, because nobody actually bought the thing.

[(14:02)](#!):

But when the revolution hit, Saint-Juste found his calling. Unemployed in 1790, he joined his local National Guard unit, showed an amazing capacity for enforcing military discipline, and was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel, despite being just 23 years old. During this period, he took up a correspondence first with Camille de Moulin, now a major literary celebrity, and Maximilien Robespierre, the incorruptible leader of the Jacobins. Saint-Juste lavished praise on Robespierre, and Robespierre reciprocated with a kind of long-distance mentorship.

[(14:36)](#!):

Saint-Juste was still too young to fully participate in the real action in Paris, so he wrote a book called The Spirit of the Revolution that reflected on the new political principles that ought to now govern France, but it too went totally unread. Saint-Juste’s stymied ambitions, though, suddenly caught a break with the insurrection of August the 10th, because he cleared the minimum age requirement to stand for election to the national convention by one month, thanks to his prominence in the local National Guard. When he was elected, he was elected by far the youngest member of the new assembly.

[(15:13)](#!):

Saint-Juste’s maiden speech on November the 13th was an immediate sensation. In an era that loved great oratory, it was apparently a masterwork. Even Brissot admired the performance. In a blistering speech, Saint-Juste condemned to this man Louis Capet, not as a criminal or even a traitor, because treason implies betrayal of your own people, and Louis is a stranger among us. He is an enemy alien in our midst. Legal minutiae was irrelevant. Specific charges were irrelevant. Louis’s real crime was simply being king. Saint-Juste concluded with prophetic words that he himself would soon come to fully and truly internalize. No man can reign innocently. There should be no trial. Louis was guilty, and so Louis must die.

[(16:07)](#!):

Just a few days after this electrifying performance, an even more electrifying revelation hit the convention. Interior minister Rolan came forward on November the 20th and revealed that a secret safe had been discovered in the Tuileries Palace. Rolan had opened it and gone through the 600-plus documents contained therein and found some pretty damning stuff. Written proof in the king’s own hand that Louis had repeatedly tried to obstruct the national assembly and then the legislative assembly, that he had encouraged his ministers to lie, engaged in shadow diplomacy that contradicted his public statements, that he encouraged emigration, and in his own words, hated the revolution.

[(16:48)](#!):

Contained also in this safe was the shocking proof that the great Mirabeau, first revolutionary hero interned in the Pantheon, had in fact been a bought-and-paid-for royal stooge. After railing against Rolan for rooting around in the safe alone to hide or plant God knows what, the mountain asserted that the documents in the secret safe only further proved that a trial was unnecessary.

[(17:16)](#!):

But the convention delegates were still clearly leaning towards a trial on the basis of Mayes’ recommendations. Robespierre made one last attempt to talk them out of it by arguing that if Louis was presumed innocent, as he must be for a trial to work, then what does that say about the revolution? But the Girondins carried the day. The convention voted on December the 6th to establish a committee to drop a formal list of accusations. The king would have his day in court.

[(17:47)](#!):

When that list came back, it took the form of a revolutionary history of events from May 1789 to August 1792. Louis had frivolously bankrupted the nation, called the estate’s general to bail him out, and then offered mere token reforms in return.

[(18:03)](#!):

When the third estate resisted his will, he ordered troops to bar their meetings and declared a royal session, which led to the tennis court oath. Then the king trampled the tricolor cockade and started massing troops in Paris, which led to the fall of the Bastille. He later delayed the promulgation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and through it all he bribed delegates and conspired with counter-revolutionaries. Then after the legislative assembly convened, he obstructed the will of the people by continuously vetoing their legislation. He then tried to make a run for it in the flight to Varenne, with the plain intention of returning at the head of an Austrian army. When that failed, he encouraged the Austrians to invade on their own. Then on the morning of August the 10th, the king had massed an armed force inside the Tuileries palace to launch a violent coup.

[(18:51)](#!):

With his accusation list complete, the convention ordered Louis to appear the next day to respond to the charges. Louis was escorted down to the mnage on the morning of December the 11th, and he was brought before a chamber overflowing with spectators who had lined up all night for a chance to get inside and see the show. After reading the accusations through in full, one of the convention secretaries then went through it all point by point and demanded Louis respond to each charge.

[(19:22)](#!):

Though he was hearing all this for the first time, the deposed king had an answer for everything. What law did I break when I ordered the royal session? Moving troops around is my right as king. The story about the trample-cockade is a lie. I only delayed the promulgation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man because I had some revisions I wanted made. The Constitution of 1791 specifically gave me the right to veto legislation, so how could exercising that veto be a crime? And as for the events of August the 10th, the idea that I gathered troops to launch some kind of attack is absurd. Paris had gone into revolt. An armed mob was on the way. As the legal executive, I gathered my legally appointed bodyguards to defend the legal constitution.

[(20:08)](#!):

But though Louis had an answer for everything, some of his answers were obviously lies, as when he asserted that the flight to Varennes had been a harmless family vacation that had just been wildly misinterpreted. He also routinely blamed bad advice from bad ministers rather than accepting responsibility for his own decisions.

[(20:28)](#!):

But the most maddening bit came when Louis started being handed the various pieces of paper that proved this or that charge, papers often written in his own hand. Louis refused to acknowledge that he had drafted them. I mean, he had, of course he had, but Louis was going to make them prove it, which, if it was possible at all, was going to take forever. So, throwing a giant wrench into things, Louis just kept blandly saying that, uh, I’ve never seen this piece of paper before in my life. It drove everyone crazy.

[(21:02)](#!):

When it was all over, Louis asked for a lawyer to help him prepare a defense, a request that was for the moment ignored. Instead, the king was dismissed back to the temple at about 6.30, ending the first of only two times that he would appear before the convention in the whole four-month ordeal of his trial. The next day, a delegation came over to the temple to tell the king that they had voted to allow him counsel. And in the end, he wound up defended by three lawyers, one of whom Louis requested. The other two volunteered.

[(21:36)](#!):

When Louis huddled with his team, there were essentially three strategies open. He could go the full King Charles and refuse to acknowledge the competency of the convention to try him. He could go in the opposite direction and beg for mercy. Or he could accept the legitimacy of the trial and fight it out.

[(21:55)](#!):

Given his performance on December 11, it was clear the direction Louis wanted to go. He intended to present himself as a wrongly accused constitutional monarch. The framework of his defense would be that he could not be held responsible for anything that had happened before he accepted the Constitution of 1791, and since his acceptance, he had broken no laws, committed no crimes, and done nothing to break his oath to uphold that constitution.

[(22:23)](#!):

Meanwhile, back in the convention, the delegates decided to bypass the legal conundrum created by Louis’ refusal to recognize his own handwriting. They simply voted on December 15 that all the documents were authentic. Problem solved. Now this solution was of course wildly at odds with some of the most cherished legal doctrines held by the lawyer delegates. I mean, you’re not supposed to be able to just declare evidence authentic. But they were all now getting a lesson in just how quickly expedience can come to Trump principles. No one, it seems, can reign innocently.

[(23:00)](#!):

The convention then dumped the evidence in the king’s lap on December 17 and said, uh, look it over. Have your defense ready by December 26. Conveying the mountains of paperwork, the king’s lawyers pointed out that this was clearly not giving them anything resembling adequate time to prepare a defense, which was another one of those cherished legal doctrines. But the convention ignored the complaint. So Louis’ lawyers basically didn’t sleep for a week and a half as they tried to cobble together some kind of coherent defense. On December the 26th, Louis once again made the coach ride to a packed menage to present that defense.

[(23:39)](#!):

The session began at 9 a.m. and after a few preliminaries, the youngest of Louis’ lawyers took the floor. The hours-long oration he delivered covered a lot of the ground we’ve already discussed, so there’s no need to go into too much detail here. But he said, you know, whatever the king’s crime, the only punishment prescribed in the Constitution of 1791 is forced abdication, and that has already happened. Also, this whole proceeding is illegal and has flagrantly ignored rights granted to the accused, rules of evidence, access to witnesses, I mean everything we say we believe in.

[(24:13)](#!):

The meat of the oration, though, was a royalist spin on the history of the Revolution. Louis had voluntarily given up his powers after calling the estates general. Nothing he had done since accepting the Constitution of 1791 had been illegal. Vetoing legislation, that wasn’t a crime, that was his explicit right and, frankly, his duty. Sure, he had sent money to friends in need, but that just showed that he was a generous man. And as for this business about August the 10th, I mean my god, how much can you twist that story? Louis was going to march out at the head of 900 Swiss guards and seize control of Paris? Are you joking? Louis was merely trying to defend himself. As the constitutional sovereign from an illegally armed mob.

[(24:60)](#!):

When the lawyer finished up, the king was given the last word. Louis reiterated his horror at being blamed for spilling the blood of his people, which he had never intended and certainly never ordered. Then he said simply that his conscience reproached him for nothing. In his heart, Louis truly believed that he was innocent. And then the king was escorted back to the temple. He would not appear before the convention again.

[(25:29)](#!):

Back in the convention, the mountain called for an immediate vote. Saint-Just came down and argued that whoever Louis the man was, whatever his version of the story was, we need to kill the king to cement the foundation of the Republican revolution. Forget about the man. Focus on the symbolism. But the convention was clearly wavering about what its next move ought to be. And that’s when the Girondins drew the next great battle line in the sand, when they proposed an appeal to the people. The gist of the appeal was that the convention’s ruling ought to be ratified in the tens of thousands of primary assemblies across the nation.

[(26:09)](#!):

The logic of the appeal as presented by the Girondins was simple. The convention was deliberating under the dangerous eye of the Paris radicals. And their final verdict couldn’t help but reflect the influence of that dangerous eye. For the true will of the nation to be known, the question must be put to the nation.

[(26:31)](#!):

The mountain of course went crazy. Robespierre led the opposition by saying that this has nothing to do with high-minded republicanism or taking the pulse of the nation. This is a naked stall tactic. It will take months just to get the primary assemblies together. And then for them to make an informed decision, they’ll need to see all the evidence, which will take forever. I mean, you got your trial. You made your accusation. The king has made his defense. What more do we need? The faction from the Girondins is just trying to get Louis off the hook. And don’t think that we don’t see this all for what it really is.

[(27:06)](#!):

For the next two weeks, the convention raged back and forth over the appeal to the people. By the first week of January, though, the majority of the delegates were exhausted from the debate. It was clear that this was as much about the Girondins and the mountain taking shots at each other as it was deciding the fate of the king.

[(27:26)](#!):

So that exhausted majority cut through the bickering, and a set of decisive roll call votes was scheduled to begin January the 14th. After even more wrangling, the questions that those decisive votes would answer were laid down. First, is Louis guilty, yes or no? Second, will there be an appeal to the people, yes or no? Third, what should the king’s punishment be? This last was not a yes or no question, which, as we’ll see in a second, added even more confusion to the proceedings.

[(28:04)](#!):

Now the first vote was easy. Louis was guilty. Everyone believed that. That had been decided before the trial. So on that first roll call on the evening of January the 14th, 693 delegates voted yes, 26 voted some qualified version of yes, and no one voted no. Louis was guilty. That led to the second vote on the appeal to the people, and this was a real test of strength between the Girondins and the mountain.

[(28:32)](#!):

It took all night to get through the roll as delegates now wanted to explain themselves and their votes for the record, but when it was all said and done, 283 voted for the appeal, and 424 voted against. After not having its way for months, the mountain suddenly won an utterly decisive victory over the Girondins. And this vote is indeed a key bit of proof that the Girondins were not a coherent party at all, because many of the men assumed to be in the Girondin inner circle broke ranks and voted against the appeal, and all for their very own particular reasons.

[(29:12)](#!):

After that all-night session, the convention adjourned and came back on January the 16th to start the final vote. What would the king’s punishment be? But the very first guy to vote, Jean-Baptiste Mayol, as it turned out, said, I vote for death, but I believe the execution should be delayed. This set off an agitated flutter through the convention because it meant that if enough delegates backed this delay amendment, they would all have to take another vote on whether to delay the execution, if execution was indeed the verdict.

[(29:47)](#!):

The vote on punishment took even longer than the other two votes, as every delegate now really super wanted to be on the record about why they were voting the way they were voting. When Robespierre came forward to vote for death, even though he was a notorious opponent of capital punishment, he justified his vote by saying, I do not recognize a humanity that massacres the people and pardons despots.

[(30:12)](#!):

As dawn approached, the voting remained extraordinarily tight. It was basically a race to see if death without qualification could hit the 361 votes needed for an outright majority. It wasn’t until the very last departmental delegation voted that death without reservation received its 361st vote.

[(30:35)](#!):

In all the exhausted chaos of the voting, though, there were questions about the final tallies, and so it wasn’t until January the 18th that the final vote was announced. 28 delegates had abstained, 319 voted for some punishment other than death, mostly imprisonment or exile, 12 voted for death with a reprieve, 26 voted for the so-called male amendment, death with a delayed execution, but the necessary 361 votes for death without reservation still stood. So execution it would be. But then, oh God, the votes for death with a reprieve and the male amendment forced a fourth and final final vote on January the 19th. Would Louis be granted a reprieve?

[(31:23)](#!):

This time, things moved quite a bit quicker, 310 said yes, reprieve, 380 said no, reprieve. And that was finally that. At 3 a.m. on January the 20th, the convention approved its proclamation announcing the votes and saying that Louis was sentenced to death and that he would face his punishment within 24 hours. The convention had just spent four months debating his fate, and there would be no further delays. Now Louis had known since the unofficial tally came through on January the 17th that he was a dead man, and he started making preparations. He requested that he be allowed a priest to come and pray with him and give him his last rights, a request that was granted. He also asked for his copy of David Hume’s History of England so he could study up on Charles the First, just about the only other man in history who could possibly know what Louis was going through.

[(32:19)](#!):

He spent his final night with his family and even managed to get a few hours sleep. At 8 a.m. on the morning of January the 21st, 1793, the executioner of Paris escorted King Louis XVI into a waiting carriage. The carriage then embarked on a slow and deliberate journey from the temple to the Place de la Concorde, formerly known as the Place de la Louis XV and now known as the Place de la Concorde. To prevent anything from even considering possibly going wrong, soldiers were lined up four deep the entire route. The gates and walls of Paris were heavily fortified, and every section was ordered to have guards in place everywhere. In all, something like 80,000 men were under arms that day. Something went wrong.

[(33:12)](#!):

The carriage arrived at the Place de la R\xc3\xa9volution at about 10 a.m. 20,000 Parisians were crammed in for the most unprecedented execution in the history of France. Carpenters had erected a scaffold near the center of the square facing the Champs-\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es, and the machine, the guillotine, sat silently atop the scaffold, blade poised. The executioners attempted to strip Louis of his overclothes, but the king shook them off, and with great dignity took them off himself. Then he climbed the scaffold. Upon reaching the top, he spoke his final words.

[(33:50)](#!):

I die innocent, he said. I pardon my enemies and hope that my blood will be useful to the French, that it will appease God’s anger. But before he could say any more, the general in charge of the day’s events ordered the drummers to start up and cut the king off. The executioner then laid Louis on a plank, stuck his head through the fatal hole of the guillotine, and then zip, thud, the end. The king is dead. Long live the revolution.

[(34:23)](#!):

Louis XVI was not a bad man. He was not a tyrant. He wasn’t even a particularly bad king. As I mentioned way back when, had Louis lived in less tumultuous times, he probably would have gone down in history as a perfectly forgettable placeholder\xe2\x80\x94liked, but not loved, certainly not hated. But he lived in very tumultuous times. And so the characteristics that would have made him forgettable\xe2\x80\x94sort of a benevolent cluelessness\xe2\x80\x94left him utterly unable to handle the tidal wave that crashed down on Versailles in 1789.

[(34:58)](#!):

Something he did cause the French Revolution. The pieces were already in place when he showed up. And as we saw through the early episodes, his ministry made numerous attempts to patch the ship before it sank. But Louis just didn’t have the spine to do what needed to be done. Now Charles I’s great sin was inflexibility. Just maddening and damning inflexibility. I mean, my God, Charles, nobody wanted to kill you.

[(35:26)](#!):

Louis XVI’s great sin was over-flexibility. The slightest pushback and he bent, whichever way you wanted him to bend. He could have forced through all those judicial and administrative reforms his ministers were pushing for back in the 1770s and 1780s. And had he stuck to his guns and had their back, maybe things would have turned out different. But any time things got rough, Louis put his guns down.

[(35:54)](#!):

His running indecisiveness made a mess of things once the Revolution got going. One minute he was embracing the Revolution, the next minute he was rejecting it. And he was tragically prone to taking the wrong advice at any given moment. He was soft when he should have been hard, hard when he should have been soft. I think the most revealing incident was that royal session that was finally held after the drama of the tennis court oath. That session was supposed to be about offering an olive branch to the Third Estate. And Louis instead listened to his arch-conservative brothers and made it about waving the sword in all of their faces.

[(36:31)](#!):

Then when the Third Estate delegates openly defied his order to disperse, he said, oh well, let them stay. I mean, Louis was a really bad crisis manager in the middle of what can only be described as one of the greatest crises in the history of the world. There was just no consistency at the center. And so the whole thing spun wildly out of control. Did Louis XVI cause the French Revolution? No. No, he did not. Did he make it damn hard to keep under control with all his mixed signals and hypocrisies and vacillations? Yes. Yes, he did. And they killed him for it.

[(37:11)](#!):

Next week we will double back a bit and cover the news from the war front, which as I said had given the national convention the space it needed to focus on killing Louis. And then we will move forward towards the spring of 1793, when the bitter struggles between the Girondins and the mountain will soon lead to yet another popular insurrection.

[“Pomp and Circumstance”] Episode 3.27, Advance and Retreat. As I mentioned at the beginning of last week’s episode, the reason the national convention was able to spend so much time focused on the king’s trial was that out on the frontiers, the French armies were not just successfully holding off the allies. They were positively steamrolling the allies.

[(02:11)](#!):

After the victory at Valmy, French forces went on the offensive and enjoyed an unbroken string of successes between November 1792 and March 1793 that not only allowed the convention to emphatically end a thousand years of monarchy by waving Louis’ severed head around, but also to make a bold new set of claims about what the war was about. No longer was this about a quick punch to the Austrian’s nose to prove a point. This was now about burning down the old Europe so that a new revolutionary Europe could rise from the ashes.

[(02:46)](#!):

After the Allied army abruptly turned around following the Battle of Valmy in September 1792, the victorious General Dumouriez made no effort to interfere with the retreat. Instead, he followed at a safe distance and then sent emissaries to the Prussian leaders asking if they wanted to cut a deal. Dumouriez was of the opinion that France and Prussia were natural allies given their mutual hatred of the Austrians. But the Prussian King Frederick William II said that before any negotiations could take place, King Louis would have to be restored to the French throne.

[(03:22)](#!):

Now, as you’ll recall, Dumouriez was himself a constitutional royalist. He abhorred the insurrection of August the 10th and the just-announced abolition of the French monarchy. But for the moment, there was nothing he could do about any of it. So, negotiations with the Prussians never got off the ground.

[(03:40)](#!):

After talks broke down, Dumouriez then returned to his original plan, a bold invasion of the Austrian Netherlands. Preparations had obviously been put on hold while he marched down to block the Allied advance. But with the Allies in retreat, Dumouriez redoubled his efforts to get the Army of the North in shape for an invasion. In the weeks after Valmy, that Army of the North absorbed tens of thousands of utterly raw volunteers. It was all those enthusiastic Saint-Qilat who had joined up in the wake of the September massacres. These guys clearly had a lot of heart but didn’t know the first thing about soldiering. So Dumouriez spent October drilling his new recruits. He had no illusions about turning them into some well-oiled machine, but he could maybe teach them to all charge in roughly the same direction at roughly the same time.

[(04:33)](#!):

By early November, Dumouriez judged his forces ready enough to cross the frontier into the Austrian Netherlands, which, for simplicity and clarity’s sake, I’m just gonna start referring to as Belgium because that’s basically what we’re talking about here.

[(04:49)](#!):

Dumouriez had a very good reason for being confident about his chances, even if his troops weren’t professionals. The army he commanded now numbered about 32,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, and boasted about 100 heavy guns. The Austrians, meanwhile, had just 20,000 troops total, garrisoning the entire length of the frontier. So when Dumouriez ordered his army to cross the border on November the 3rd, there was just no Austrian force large enough to stop him. As long as his new volunteers didn’t run away at the first sign of trouble, the weight of their numbers would be irresistible.

[(05:29)](#!):

On November the 6th, Dumouriez’s army encountered the first concentrated Austrian defenses, and they did not run away. The Austrians had stationed just shy of 14,000 men along a five-mile ridge, running between the fortified city of Mons and the town of Gemapp. With his massively superior forces, Dumouriez divided his army up into two columns and sent them on a double flanking move to surround the Austrian defenders. But after a morning spent fighting, the uncoordinated waves of French infantry just couldn’t dislodge the professional Austrians.

[(06:06)](#!):

So around noon, Dumouriez switched things up. He ordered one giant column to form in the middle and said, you know, just force your way up there. This time, the onslaught was too much for the Austrian defenders. The French captured the middle of the ridge and then managed to dig in and hold it. With the Austrian army now divided, another French column managed to flank the Austrian right at the town of Gemapp, and the Austrians were forced to withdraw all their forces back to Mons.

[(06:34)](#!):

The victory at the Battle of Gemapp, like the victory at Valmy, was immediately seized on as a great victory for the new citizen army of revolutionary France, proof that the old regimes of Europe couldn’t possibly withstand the might of a fully mobilized nation. But again, like Valmy, the glory of Gemapp was maybe a bit overstated. With supporting reinforcements, the French threw over 40,000 men at a ridge held by just 14,000 defenders.

[(07:03)](#!):

Yes, it was impressive that the French volunteers kept charging up the hill, and yes, it was impressive that the French were able to muster that many men to begin with, but the actual victory really came down to a numbers game. If those same French forces had only outnumbered their opponents a helpful two to one instead of an overwhelming three to one, would they still have been able to win? How about a battle between equal forces? That real test still lay ahead.

[(07:32)](#!):

In the aftermath of the Battle of Gemapp, it became clear that the Austrians, though, were not prepared to effectively defend Belgium. The forces that had just retreated back to Mons surrendered the city the next day, leaving behind the heavy guns in exchange for safe passage. A few days later, the French marched out of Mons, and the remaining Austrian forces just got out of their way. Dumourieu entered Brussels on November the 14th without firing a shot. Then, as the French fanned out across the countryside, the Austrians just withdrew from the territory back east towards Cologne, where they would spend the winter regrouping. By the end of November, the French were in complete control of Belgium.

[(08:14)](#!):

Down south, the French enjoyed a similar run of success after facing even less resistance than Dumourieu had faced up in Belgium. Along the Mediterranean coast, the old independent feudal territory of Savoy was invaded in September, and the capital Nice was captured. Then, up along the Rhine, all those little independent German principalities on the west bank of the river found themselves utterly exposed to an attack. When the main Allied army had retreated after Valmy, they just kind of kept going until they were back safe and secure on the east side of the Rhine, which left literally no one protecting those little German principalities on the west side of the Rhine from the advancing French.

[(08:54)](#!):

A steady stream of aristocrats, high church officials, and wealthy families packed up everything they owned and fled east as the French accepted the wide-open invitation to move on in. So how do we explain the sudden turn in the fortunes of war? In less than six weeks, the French had gone from certain annihilation to capturing Belgium, Savoy, and the constellation of principalities along the Rhine. It was an impressive about-face, and it shocked the rest of Europe. So how do we explain it?

[(09:28)](#!):

Now, the big overarching explanation is clearly that the Allies had underestimated just how resilient the French would be. The Austrian impression strategy had basically been invade France, blow through the disorganized French armies, and take Paris. Should take a few weeks at the most. So at the outset, the Allies simply weren’t prepared to actually fight, and that does explain a lot of this.

[(09:54)](#!):

But that does not explain why the French were able to give them a fight. So what does? Well, first of all, there was the fact that the whole new concept of every citizen a potential soldier was working exactly the way it was supposed to. 180,000 Frenchmen volunteered for service in 1792 alone. As we just saw, the raw manpower available to the French was an order of magnitude beyond what the Allies were currently putting together with their traditionally small professional armies.

[(10:26)](#!):

But, who was gonna lead all those enthusiastic volunteers? Well, I’ll tell you. A French officer corps that was now becoming an advantage rather than a liability. By this point, every disaffected officer who was going to desert their post had already deserted their post. That meant that those who stayed behind were true believers, emotionally committed to the revolution. And those guys were soon joined by experienced NCOs promoted from within the ranks to fill all the vacant officer spots.

[(10:60)](#!):

This reconstituted officer corps was not secretly hoping the Austrians and Prussians would win. They wanted to spend every waking moment make sure that the Austrians and Prussians got their teeth kicked in. So by the time the French army started pushing out after Valmy, their officers were experienced, dedicated, and passionately committed to the cause. That combination of a hyper-committed officer corps leading a huge mass of regular soldiers was a lethal combination. And if the allies wanted to defeat it, they were going to have to start taking this all a bit more seriously.

[(11:38)](#!):

With all these sudden victories on their hands, the national convention then started getting a little giddy. And in between debates over the fate of the king, their whole conception of the war began to change. On November the 19th, they issued the decree of fraternity, which basically said, we will offer aid to any oppressed people looking to recover their lost liberties. Now since the beginning of the war, Brissot’s rhetoric had hinted at the larger ideological themes of a war with Austria. That spreading the gospel of the revolution would be a pretty awesome thing to do. But really, until now, this had just been a lot of talk.

[(12:19)](#!):

But now that it looked like revolutionary France might actually have the power to seize territory from the old European powers, the ideological side of the war began to be talked about more seriously. This shift in focus culminated with a further decree on December the 15th, that revolutionary principles would be instituted in all the quote unquote liberated territories. Clerical and aristocratic lands were to be confiscated. Tithes and feudal dues abolished. New taxes would be imposed on the rich. All local state functionaries must swear an oath of allegiance to these revolutionary principles. The revolution was now on the march.

[(13:00)](#!):

Robespierre, of course, as usual, was a big stick in the mud about all of this. And he pointed out that this might not all work out the way everyone expected. That the French armies imposing French principles might not be wholeheartedly embraced by the citizens of the occupied, excuse me, liberated territories. And he said that liberty can never be founded by the use of foreign force. But as ideology came to play a larger role in the French desire to liberate territory from their enemies, there was a much simpler national interest at stake. An interest that was also now being openly discussed.

[(13:43)](#!):

France securing its natural borders. If you look at a relief map of Europe, it’s easy to tell what those natural borders ought to be. The Alps in the southeast, the Mediterranean in the south, the Pyrenees in the southwest, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the English Channel to the north, and the Rhine River to the east. Of those six, only the west bank of the Rhine remained to be secured. And with the German principalities now stormed and Belgium in hand, it was really down to whether the French could peel off the requisite Dutch territory to complete the natural circuit.

[(14:21)](#!):

Which of course brings us to the British, who had done so much to remain neutral so far and who now could not avoid getting into the war. The provocation of the British began the minute Dumourier crossed into Belgium. You’ll recall that the only reason the Austrians held that territory in the first place was because the British didn’t want the French to control it. And indeed, all through the 18th century, British foreign policy had been all about keeping the low countries in their sphere of political and economic influence and away from the French sphere of political and economic influence.

[(14:59)](#!):

So despite Prime Minister William Pitt’s fervent desire to remain neutral, the French invasion of Belgium put him in a major bind. The first officially provocative action came on November the 16th, when the French declared freedom of navigation on the Scheldt River, which the Dutch had held an exclusive claim to since the end of the Thirty Years’ War way back in 1648.

[(15:23)](#!):

Now access to the river in and of itself wasn’t actually a huge deal, but the flagrant disregard for a century and a half old treaty obligation certainly was. Shortly thereafter, the Austrians evacuated Belgium and French forces were able to advance all the way to the borders with the United Provinces. The Dutch then started jumping up and down and begging London for assistance, assistance that now looked like the British were going to have to provide, unless they wanted to wake up in a few days and discover that revolutionary France now controlled like the entire coast of the continent facing the British Isles.

[(16:02)](#!):

Now luckily for Pitt, the slow turn towards war was generally supported at home. Now many liberty-loving Brits had cheered on the revolution when it first got going. Thomas Paine’s radical The Rights of Man had outsold Edmund Burke’s conservative reflections on the revolution in France at like a 10 to one clip. Even those who were opposed to the revolution did not see any reason to get involved with the madness currently unfolding on the continent.

[(16:29)](#!):

But the insurrection of August the 10th and then most especially the September massacres turned public opinion in Britain decisively against the revolution. So Pitt knew that if he now decided to take the country into war, that he was on firm political footing at home. Pitt’s emissaries continued to negotiate with the French to avoid war, but when the National Convention executed Louis, the British stopped talking. Believing their position to be nearly invincible, the National Convention responded by preemptively declaring war on Britain on February the 1st, 1793.

[(17:06)](#!):

But of course the French position was not nearly as invincible as the National Convention now believed, especially since they had just poked the British in the eye with a sharp pointy stick. It did not take long for British diplomats to draw a hostile circle around France. Soon enough, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, and Naples would all join the anti-French coalition. And also soon enough, British money would be going to pay for German mercenaries to grow the ranks of the Allied forces. So far, the French had enjoyed the advantage that comes with being underestimated, but that was not a mistake their enemies would continue to make.

[(17:47)](#!):

Now, just so you know, this whole series of campaigns from 1792 to 1797 will collectively come to be known as the War of the First Coalition, to be followed subsequently by the War of the Second Coalition, and then the War of the Third Coalition, bridging the transition from the revolutionary era into the Napoleonic era. But though the War of the First Coalition is dated to the declaration of war between France and Austria in the spring of 1792, it is really here, approaching the spring of 1793, that the First Coalition really takes shape as a pan-European effort to fight revolutionary France.

[(18:28)](#!):

Now, speaking of that pan-European effort, we cannot forget the special role somehow played by Poland in all of this. Now, one of the reasons the Prussians had been so quick to pull out of France after Valmy was because the Russians had gone into Poland and Frederick William II prioritized his eastern flank over his western flank. But as aggressive as Catherine the Great was, she was not super interested in going 10 rounds with the Prussian army now massing on the Polish border. So in January 1793, she proposed to Frederick William II a second partition of Poland.

[(19:04)](#!):

This partition was signed January the 23rd and saw Russia claim the lion’s share of Polish territory, with the Prussians receiving a strategically helpful slice that really shored up their eastern borders. The Polish Commonwealth, meanwhile, was left just one third the size that it had been before the first partition back in 1772, which we discussed back in episode 3.6. The upshot of the second partition for us is obviously that the Prussians can now turn their full attention back to the French. So come the spring of 1793, basically all of Europe will be arrayed against France, and the fortunes of war will soon turn again.

[(19:47)](#!):

Now, the other thing that really helped turn the tables against the French was that it turned out Robespierre had been absolutely right. Liberty can never be founded by the use of foreign force. All the people in all those territories that had so recently been liberated quickly discovered that their liberation looked an awful lot like a regular old occupation. The French soldiers now in their midst made themselves right at home, taking what they wanted, drinking what they wanted, sleeping where they wanted. Remember those idealistic decrees about how French armies would always respect the natural liberties of other peoples, and that they would always protect the lives and property of those people?

[(20:26)](#!):

Yeah, neither do the soldiers of the French armies. Nowhere was this more apparent than in Belgium. Dumourier’s men had spread themselves across the countryside, and were acting as if every farmhouse was their own personal supply depot. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, the national convention’s December the 15th decree that imposed revolutionary principles meant that when the damned French soldiers showed up in your town, they not only took everything that wasn’t nailed down, they also desecrated churches, seized property, and generally spit on every traditional community institution they could find.

[(21:04)](#!):

And remember, the Belgians had gone into revolt against the Austrians just a few years earlier not to overthrow all those institutions, but to protect them. So relations between the local Belgians and the occupying French got testy in a hurry. Recognizing that things weren’t going super smoothly up in Belgium, the convention dispatched no less a man than Danton himself up to Brussels to try to get a handle on things. His departure to the front in December 1792 is the reason he played almost no part in the main debates over King Louis’s fate.

[(21:43)](#!):

Now one of the other reasons that the great Danton was personally dispatched was because doubts were starting to creep in about the true loyalties of General Dumouriez. Sure, his success in the field was undeniable and publicly celebrated, but it was pretty clear he had his own long-term agenda.

[(22:02)](#!):

He was known to not be real happy about anything that had happened in Paris over the past year. The insurrection of August the 10th, the September massacres, the trial of the king. After he ran the Austrians out of Belgium, the convention started getting troubling reports about Dumouriez’s activities. He was apparently aligning himself with local conservatives, talking openly about raising an army of Belgium composed of local volunteers and funded by grants from the local Catholic church.

[(22:33)](#!):

This all looked an awful lot like Dumouriez was about to turn Belgium into some personal little power base from which he might do God knows what. So Danton was sent up to assist with the occupation, and by assist, we mean Jesus, please make sure Dumouriez doesn’t set up some kind of personal little power base to do God knows what. Dumouriez chafed under the supervision, leading to still further resentment about the course of the revolution. Despite the supreme confidence the national convention now seemed to have and the inevitability of French victory, they did recognize they could not just rest on their laurels.

[(23:14)](#!):

For one thing, now that the immediate emergency of Paris possibly being sacked had passed, a ton of those volunteer soldiers assumed that they had now done their bit to save the nation and just went home. So day by day, France was losing that overwhelming numerical advantage. For another thing, though the armies had fought pretty well, this new kind of national army was going to need a structural overhaul to really work properly.

[(23:42)](#!):

The potent mixture of adrenaline and enthusiasm had temporarily carried the revolutionary armies forward. But if they were going to keep moving forward, they were gonna have to get better organized. So shortly after the declaration of war with Britain in February 1793, the military committee of the national convention reported back a reorganization plan known as the amalgamay. The thrust of the amalgamay was simple. Make sure new volunteers are paired with permanent troops of the line rather than keeping them separate as was currently the standard practice.

[(24:18)](#!):

Specifically, brigades would be organized on the principle of one veteran battalion for every two battalions of volunteers. This would ensure quick assimilation of the new recruits into the daily realities of military life and ensure that there were always no nonsense veterans around to keep the newbies in line and in shape. And then of course, once the battle began, the presumably less fidgety veterans would be interspersed with the rookies to prevent mass panic from ever sweeping the lines.

[(24:50)](#!):

These reforms would eventually be implemented to great effect. But unfortunately, they would not be implemented fast enough to stave off the coming disasters of the spring of 1793. To make up for the steady loss of troops, a big new recruitment push was announced on February the 24th the so-called la vie of 300,000. This is exactly what it sounds like. We need 300,000 new soldiers and we need them right now.

[(25:22)](#!):

But critically, though the convention wanted these 300,000 to join up voluntarily, they recognized that that might not happen. And so they authorized impressment into service when and where necessary.

[(25:36)](#!):

So the historical significance of the la vie of 300,000 has less to do with its impact on the French war effort than its impact on a region that did not feel much like volunteering for service and were not about to sit back and let bullies from Paris force them into joining. I speak, of course, of the Vaudee region of the West, which I have been calling the Vaudee region. That’s just because the French have this like short vowel sound that my barbarian ears just refuse to recognize.

[(26:06)](#!):

So we’re gonna be talking a lot about the outbreak of the uprising in the Vaudee next week because it is a major, major part of how the revolution will play out over the next few years. But just so you know, the people of Vaudee are pretty super Catholic and have been pretty super pissed off at anti-clerical Paris for quite a while now. So the la vie of 300,000 was just a match that lit the giant pile of gasoline-soaked rags. Getting back to the war, unfortunately for the French, none of their military readiness and reorganization efforts were going to kick in fast enough to help them once the fighting recommenced.

[(26:47)](#!):

Still supremely confident, Dumourie took the declaration of war with Britain as a sign that he ought to get going with the next phase of his grand plan, invade the United Provinces. But unfortunately, this focus on advancing north led Dumourie to ignore an opportunity to combine with the French armies along the Rhine to push the Austrians who had evacuated from Belgium completely across the river. This missed opportunity meant that the Austrians could continue to gather in force outside Cologne on the West Bank, from which they would be able to stage a counter invasion of Belgium.

[(27:25)](#!):

But with the French armies in Belgium now numbering something like 120,000 total men, it is likely that Dumourie simply believed the Austrians would never be able to push their way back in. So on February the 16th, he personally led an army of about 20,000 up into Dutch territory. Marching almost due north, Dumourie attacked Breda on February the 21st and took it on February the 24th. He then quickly captured a string of smaller fortresses before getting ready for the big push that would take him through Rotterdam, the Hague, and then on to the big prize, Amsterdam.

[(28:03)](#!):

While Dumourie made this run up the coast, his eastern flank was supposed to be supported by another French army, about 10,000 strong, who were ordered to capture Maastricht and then move up to join him. But Maastricht managed to resist the initial attacks after the French arrived on February the 21st. And no one likes a prolonged siege, especially new recruits who have never done it before, especially in the middle of a Dutch winter. So the French vongelists were able to take him so the French volunteers started deserting in droves. I signed up to charge headlong at Austrians, not freeze to death, getting heckled by the Dutch.

[(28:39)](#!):

So the siege of Maastricht had to be abandoned March the 3rd and that was just the beginning of the bad news for the French. The siege of Maastricht was abandoned in part because that Austrian army that had gathered near Cologne had finally started marching west and they were now something like 40,000 strong. They smashed a much smaller French army at Aldenhoven on March the 1st and were looking deadly serious about retaking Belgium. With his army on the move, the national convention ordered De Maurier to abandon his ambitious push up into the United Provinces and instead come down south to lead the defense of Belgium.

[(29:19)](#!):

De Maurier wasn’t happy about being bossed around by the convention, but for the moment, he did what he was told and he headed south. He arrived outside Brussels on March the 11th and took command of the 45,000 or so men who had rendezvoused to face the Austrians. So let’s see what happens when two armies of equal size face off against each other. Upon taking command, De Maurier had two paradoxical thoughts in his head. The first was that his army was invincible and would whip the Austrians easily. The second was that if he ordered any kind of strategic withdrawal, that his invincible army would disintegrate into a panicked flight.

[(29:59)](#!):

So there was only one thing to do. He ordered a bold advance forward to meet the Austrians head on. The two armies met across an extended line that roughly centered around the town of Niervenden. De Maurier divided his forces into eight columns and identified the Austrian left as the weak link.

[(30:19)](#!):

At dawn on March the 18th, he ordered three columns on a flanking maneuver. It took all morning, but the French forces successfully took the main high ground and the town of Niervenden and even managed to hold off at least one concerted Austrian attempt to retake the ground. But further attacks and bombardments eventually forced the French to withdraw. Then it was the French’s turn to attempt to retake the ground, but their attempt failed and they had to retreat.

[(30:47)](#!):

Meanwhile, up on the Austrian right slash French left, the day had been spent mostly skirmishing around each other. But late in the day, the Austrians launched a hard cavalry charge at the clearly fatigued French infantry, a charge that turned into an utter rout. De Maurier didn’t find out that his entire left flank had fallen apart until the next morning. And when he did, he was forced to order a general retreat. The Battle of Niervenden finally represented an evenly matched fight, and the French had gotten beat and run on all fronts.

[(31:24)](#!):

Then, to make matters worse, the defeat triggered mass desertions as the men who ran simply did not come back. Within days, De Maurier was leading just 20,000 men. That remaining army lost another engagement on March the 21st to an Austrian army that now outnumbered them two to one. But De Maurier managed to extract himself back through Brussels, though by now he was clearly formulating a completely new conception of what his next move ought to be. As he passed through Brussels, he opened negotiations with the Austrians and his terms were simple. You can have Belgium back if you let me withdraw all my forces unmolested.

[(32:05)](#!):

The Austrians agreed to the terms, even allowing a trapped French army to pass through their lines on their way out of the territory. The reason for Austrian leniency was due to the hints De Maurier dropped about what his next move was going to be. Once I’m out of Belgium, I’m going to turn my armies around, march on Paris, break the national convention, and restore the Constitution of 1791. All of which sounded pretty good to the Austrians. When the convention got news of all these disasters, they sent a delegation up to confront De Maurier and demand an explanation for the loss at Niervinden and the total evacuation of Belgium.

[(32:46)](#!):

When this delegation, led personally by the Minister of War, reached De Maurier’s camp on April 1, the general did not mess around trying to pretend like he was still on their side. He arrested the delegation and handed them over to the Austrians. But De Maurier totally underestimated the loyalty of his officers and his troops. None of them thought highly of the politicians in the national convention. But as I mentioned, they were all firmly committed to the revolution and were not about to march on Paris to, what, restore the monarchy with the blessing of the Austrians? No, we are not going to do that.

[(33:23)](#!):

Unable to convince his men to follow him, De Maurier’s plans fell apart. And like so many before him, it was time to slip across the lines. On April 5, De Maurier went over to the Austrians. And among those who defected with him was the 20-year-old Louis-Philippe d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, son of Duke d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans and future King Louis-Philippe of France.

[(33:47)](#!):

So obviously, this is all really bad news for the revolutionaries in Paris, as they were once again now facing an imminent Austrian invasion, which is why they must have been so excited to hear that out west, an armed uprising had just broken out in the Vaudet. Next time, we will discuss the origins of that major uprising that threatened to destroy the revolution from the inside, just as the European powers were once again threatening to destroy it from the outside. I’ll close this week with a few scheduling notes on what’s to come in the months ahead. As sharp listeners no doubt just caught, I said next time, because there is not going to be a show next week.

[(34:28)](#!):

But after I come back, I’ll be here every week from now until the next round of Revolution’s tours get going in mid-April. Those tours are going to ultimately keep me away from the show for almost a month. So my plan is to pre-record a few episodes and stagger the releases so that I don’t just disappear completely. And oh, by the way, if you want to make a last-minute impulse buy, we still have a few open slots. So by all means, make the impulse buy of your life and come join us.

[(34:58)](#!):

Before now in the tours, though, I will be having the big 250th episode question blowout, which is scheduled right now for March the 15th. I have a ton of great questions from all the wonderful folks who spent more than $150 during the fundraiser. And it is during that episode that I will also be revealing the two winners of the Asignon from among those who bought a T-shirt, T-shirts that are, as we speak, being shipped out. So I hope you’re all looking forward to that. And I will see you all in two weeks. Thanks.

[(01:51)](#!):

Last time, we headed off to the war front to follow the rapid advance and then equally rapid retreat of the French armies, culminating with the betrayal and emigration of General Dumouriez in April 1793. This, as you can imagine, was all a distressing development for the delegates of the National Convention. But the setbacks on the war front weren’t the only distressing developments the National Convention was dealing with. At this very same moment, armed uprisings began to break out across France against the central revolutionary authorities in Paris, most especially out west in the Vaudet. For a few tense months, it looked like the oh-so-recently declared French Republic was about to collapse under the combined weight of internal revolt and external attack. Drastic measures would have to be taken if the revolution was to be saved. This week, we are going to cover the development of those provincial uprisings and the response from the Convention. I am, however, going to set aside for next week the third big distressing development the Convention confronted, the rise of the Orangie, super-radical leaders of the Paris Saint-Culotte who were hell-bent on bending the Convention to their will. I’m leaving them off because they will be the driving force behind the insurrection of May 31st to June 2nd, aka the Purge of the Girondins, that will be the focus of next week’s show. A lot was happening in the spring of 1793, and none of it was good.

[(03:18)](#!):

The first hints that all was not well out in the departments came when the National Convention decreed that levy of 300,000 at the end of February 1793. This troop levy was supposed to replenish the French armies who were shrinking daily from the combined effects of enlistment terms coming due and outright desertion. Mostly what the levy did, though, was spark angry protests across France. Remember, while the Convention hoped that the troop quotas would be filled by voluntary enlistment, local municipal authorities were authorized to compel service when necessary, which sort of ran counter to the whole era of liberty that has supposedly dawned. I mean, how is it that I’m supposed to stand here listening to you wax poetic about individual freedom and civil rights while pointing a gun at my head and ordering me to march to the front lines?

[(04:07)](#!):

So all through February and March 1793, reports came into Paris describing hostility and opposition to the recruitment drive. This resistance was, in most places, overcome eventually, but even so, the hostile response to the levy of 300,000 put the authorities in Paris unnoticed that the French nation was not yet the unified power it needed to be if it was going to prevail in its war against Europe.

[(04:32)](#!):

But though resistance to the draft was eventually overcome in most areas, in one region in particular, resistance was very much not overcome. Instead, it blossomed into a full-scale armed revolt that history has dubbed the War in the Vaudet.

[(04:49)](#!):

This extraordinarily bitter civil war would be waged through 1796 and would be defined by some of the worst atrocities of the revolutionary era. Captured rebels in the Vaudet wound up supplying just over half the total victims executed during the reign of terror, and that was on top of the tens of thousands of civilians massacred by the so-called Infernal Columns in early 1794. The War in the Vaudet is a dark and brutal fight, and it’s going to be a major theater of action for the next few years, so let’s dig into why things got so ugly.

[(05:26)](#!):

The Vaudet region composes roughly the four departments south of the Loire River in western France. Never a major economic center, nor boasting a major port, the Vaudet was not on the beaten path from anywhere to anywhere, so the inhabitants of the region were generally isolated from the rest of France. On top of that, its geography was defined by dense hedgerows and thick forests, which led to sparse habitation compared to, say, Brittany, its far more densely populated neighbor to the north. This meant that both the Vaudet region as a whole and the individual communities within it were fairly insular, and as is often the case with insular rural communities, the people were happy with their traditional ways. So from the very beginning, the revolution was an unwelcome intruder in the Vaudet.

[(06:16)](#!):

But opposition to the revolution in the region wasn’t just because the locals were a bunch of backward neophobes. Mostly, it was because their experience with the allegedly rotten parts of the Ancien regime had always been fairly positive. For one thing, the peasants never felt any intense hatred of the local aristocracy. The general poverty of the region meant that the Vaudet nobles could never afford to move away to the big city like so many of their aristocratic brethren had done in the years leading up to the revolution. By remaining on their ancestral estates, they remained a part of the local community with all the rights and responsibilities that went along with it, and they did not neglect the responsibility side of that equation because basically it’s much harder to be a jerk to people that you see every day. So there was never a strong us versus them mentality among the peasants or the nobles, both of whom pretty much accepted that they needed each other.

[(07:12)](#!):

But that general lack of anger at the aristocracy was nothing compared to the practically non-existent anger at the Catholic Church, and it was over the Church more than anything else that the war in the Vaudet was fought. As a consequence of that regional insularity, the local churches and the local priests of the Vaudet were always strong pillars of the community, and more so than in other regions, those local priests were not outside appointees. They were native sons who went off to ecclesiastic college and then returned to minister to their friends and relatives and neighbors.

[(07:46)](#!):

On top of that, the economic relations between the priests and their parishioners was never a source of much tension. The priests of the Vaudet enjoyed livings that always kept them fairly comfortable, while the tithes imposed were never so oppressive that their parishioners saw them as mere parasites. In short, for the people of the Vaudet, the traditional Catholic Church was working just fine as a bedrock of our community, thank you very much.

[(08:11)](#!):

So it shouldn’t be too hard to guess what the reaction in the Vaudet was to the civil constitution of the clergy when it was promulgated in 1790. They were appalled. Just about every single Vaudet priest refused to take the civic oath, and they were roundly applauded by their parishioners for doing so. Whatever the godless Philistines in Paris are up to, we want no part of it.

[(08:33)](#!):

Now as I mentioned, the National Assembly tended to tolerate the non-juring clergy. But after the legislative assembly took over and the war with Austria began, the central authorities in Paris decided that coddling the refractory priests was no longer an option. So the assembly voted to shut down illegal services, arrest non-juring priests, and make sure every parish was staffed with a fully sworn up member of the new civic clergy. When revolutionary authorities came around hunting for non-juring priests though, the people of the Vaudet did not hesitate to hide their sacred brothers in barns and in fields and provide them with all the food and supplies they needed to survive.

[(09:13)](#!):

But all of this said, the Vaudet was not uniformly opposed to the revolution, and the major towns were filled with exactly the kind of patriotic bourgeoisie we find in other regions. And while there wasn’t much tension between the peasants and the nobility, there was tension between the peasants and those townspeople, especially as the revolution progressed. For example, the seizure and sale of church lands was of course opposed by the pious peasantry of the Vaudet. But once it got going, there was some general hope that maybe it would bring some relief to those who had too little land or no land at all. I mean, some justice might spring from the sacrilegious program.

[(09:53)](#!):

What wound up happening though is that the patriotic townspeople bought up all the land because they were the only ones who could come up with the cash at auction time. So all that land was simply transferred from the church, who the peasants loved, to the patriotic townspeople, who they really, really did not. And then the patriotic townspeople started coming along asking for rent.

[(10:16)](#!):

But still, into 1793, resistance to the revolution in the Vaudet was mostly passive. Sure, the locals had a tendency to fling dung and garbage at the poor civic clergymen who were assigned to minister to these superstitious peasants but that was about the worst of it. But then the godless revolutionaries in Paris killed King Louis, who God had appointed to be their father protector, an almost unthinkable crime. And then about a month after that, the national convention handed down the lev\xc3\xa9 of 300,000 and that was the end of passive resistance in the Vaudet. It’s one thing to sit and put up with a revolution you despise. It is quite another to be ordered to the front lines of war to defend that despised revolution with your life. Adding to the insult of forced conscription was the fact that all those patriotic townspeople who actually supported the revolution filled up the ranks of the local National Guard units. And wouldn’t you know it, when the lev\xc3\xa9 of 300,000 came down, those local Guard units were exempted from service on the front lines because they were already considered mobilized at home. So the only people actually benefiting from this stupid revolution are also the only people who don’t have to go off and die for it. And that’s right about when the peasants of the Vaudet started picking up sharp objects.

[(11:33)](#!):

By early March, groups of armed peasants started banding together in large numbers to resist the draft. They were done taking it. It was time to start dishing it out. But since this is the French Revolution, when it came time to dish it out, these pious peasants had as little remorse for their opponents as the most vicious sans-culottes heretics in Paris.

[(11:56)](#!):

On March the 11th, an armed peasant mob stormed the town of Mashcou. The town’s little National Guard unit mustered, but they were vastly outnumbered. The peasants overran the town, hunting down any pro-revolutionary patriot they could find and killing them on the spot. Then they even set up the same kind of little kangaroo court that had sprouted up during the September massacres to judge prisoners, this time for pro-revolutionary crimes rather than counter-revolutionary crimes. The result was the same, though. Mass summary executions. Upwards of 500 people were killed, and the war in the Vaudet was off to a very bloody start.

[(12:35)](#!):

But as I just mentioned, resistance to the Laveille of 300,000 was not unique to the Vaudet and was actually fairly widespread across France. For example, just north in Brittany, similar armed mobs began to form to resist the draft. But there was a huge difference. Brittany was both densely populated and strategically located on the coast facing Great Britain. That meant it was well-garrisoned by large companies of National Guard and regular soldiers. These troops quickly moved in to clamp down on resistance before it got out of hand.

[(13:09)](#!):

But down in the Vaudet, the isolated, insular Vaudet, there had never been any reason to maintain that kind of military presence. So once the peasants got to rampaging, there was no one to stop them, and the thing snowballed in no time. The National Convention started getting reports of all these anti-draft disturbances in the Vaudet and everywhere else through the first weeks of March. This was right at the moment when they were also getting reports that the Austrians had launched their re-invasion of Belgium and were cutting their way through the French armies out on the frontier. Par for the course, the assumption among the Convention delegates was that some sort of sinister royalist conspiracy must be at work.

[(13:51)](#!):

What else could adequately explain the simultaneous threats to the nation? If the New Republic was going to avoid collapse, it was going to have to root out these conspirators and then work hard to forge a truly unified nation that would not be susceptible to the kind of internal discord that was currently being exploited by the alleged royalist conspirators. Selfish parochialism must give way to selfless nationalism by force if necessary.

[(14:21)](#!):

So on March the 9th, the Convention started creating institutions that they hoped would help them survive the crisis, and these institutions would soon become the means through which the coming reign of terror would be implemented.

[(14:35)](#!):

First, they established a new revolutionary tribunal to quickly try and convict identified traders to the nation, and this tribunal would, of course, become the legal fa\xc3\xa7ade of the terror. Then on that same day, the Convention voted to dispatch 80 of its members out to the departments to ensure that the political, military, and economic might of the nation was all being properly mobilized and pulling in the same direction. These delegates, soon dubbed the representatives on mission, were supposed to go out and make sure that local communities were coordinating properly with national policy, and right now, that meant explaining the nature of the military emergency facing France, raising the necessary troops to fill the army back up, and then rooting out suspected counterrevolutionaries.

[(15:23)](#!):

But to carry on their work, the representatives on mission were granted nearly unlimited power, able to overrule any other political or military authority for any reason and dispense whatever justice they saw fit when they saw fit. Needless to say, the more zealous representatives would wind up becoming some of the most notorious figures of the whole revolutionary period as they ruthlessly implemented the reign of terror in their assigned departments. Just over a week later, the news of the defeat at Niervanden arrived along with reports about General Dumouriez’s suspicious behavior.

[(15:60)](#!):

In response, the convention created two more pillars of the coming terror. First, on March the 21st, they ordered that committees of surveillance be established in every municipality to make it easy for counterrevolutionary activity to be identified and denounced. Then came the biggie. Aware that running a full-scale war abroad and a counter-counterrevolutionary campaign at home required more responsive executive action that could be provided by the huge and unwieldy convention assembly, so the convention voted on March the 25th to create the Committee of Public Safety.

[(16:38)](#!):

Initially, 25 men were supposed to sit on the new committee, but that was soon whittled down to just nine and then eventually settled at 12. Members were to be elected monthly, but they could be re-elected at will. Now, technically, the convention had tried something like this once before when they created the Committee of General Defense back on January the 1st, but that committee had never been very powerful or effective. The Committee of Public Safety was designed to correct for the weaknesses of the Committee of General Defense, and it was granted broad jurisdiction over practically everything. And as the dangers facing revolutionary France grew, so too did the power of the committee.

[(17:19)](#!):

Now, ironically, Robespierre, who would go on to be so deeply and malevolently linked to the Committee of Public Safety, initially opposed its creation, believing it to be a gambit by the Girondins to consolidate power in their own hands. But on that score, he was wrong. And after the committee was created, it was dominated not by the Girondins but by the most prominent of the delegates elected to its ranks, Danton.

[(17:43)](#!):

Indeed, for the first few months of the committee’s life, it was casually known as the Danton Committee. It would not be until after the purge of the Girondins that Robespierre would take his place and help transform the Committee of Public Safety into the Jacobin instrument of terror that we know and love today.

[(18:03)](#!):

While the convention was creating these new instruments of revolutionary order, the situation in the Vaudet was going from bad to worse. By the middle of March, bands of peasants were starting to link up, and soon irregular armies numbering in the tens of thousands were starting to take shape under an improvised rebel leadership. Wearing Sacred Hearts and royal white cockades, they were now calling themselves the Royal and Catholic Army, with the battle cry of give us back our priests and our king.

[(18:35)](#!):

The first real battle of the war was fought down near the Lay River on March the 19th, when 2,000 Republican soldiers moving north were attacked by a few thousand peasants. The two sides spent six hours fighting to a draw until an influx of rebel reinforcements arrived to force the regular soldiers into retreat. Meanwhile, further north, there was almost no reason for full battles. On March the 22nd, for example, 300 Patriot soldiers found themselves facing nearly 20,000 armed peasants. The soldiers just ran, which I can promise you is exactly what I would have done.

[(19:10)](#!):

Despite these initial successes, though, the original rebel leaders, who were mostly just prominent members of the local community, recognized that they needed real military leaders to take over if they were going to wage a real war. So they approached various local lords, many of whom had been soldiers in the Ancien Regime days, and asked them to take the reins. A few of these lords agreed, and so a real war it would be.

[(19:38)](#!):

To deal with the explosion of violence in the Vad\xc3\xa9, the convention hastily mustered as many troops as they could find to pour into the region, and their immediate efforts were pretty impressive. Nearly 50,000 troops were mobilized to go put down the uprising by the end of March. Because of their uniforms, these troops were dubbed the Blues, a name that would stick to the Republican forces for the duration of the War in the Vad\xc3\xa9.

[(20:04)](#!):

But as impressive as an influx of 50,000 troops sounds, the vast majority of the Blues were brand new recruits who had no idea how to fight a regular war, let alone fight the kind of insanely difficult irregular war that they just got dumped into. As we’ll see, the War in the Vad\xc3\xa9 is about to become the textbook example of a war of occupation. The 50,000 Republican soldiers had to be broken up and spread across the countryside to regain control of the region. These detachments usually wound up being too small to do anything but huddle together in unfamiliar territory, surrounded by a hostile population, and just be scared to death that at any moment some huge peasant mob might descend and kill them all.

[(20:49)](#!):

Meanwhile, the rebels knew every tree and brook and ditch by heart and could congregate, attack, and then disperse before the beleaguered Blues could do anything about it. Morale in the Republican ranks was basically nonexistent, and into April and then May, the rebels continued to advance, and they started looking poised to break out of the Vad\xc3\xa9 and wage a more general campaign against revolutionary Paris. But the next stage of the War of the Vad\xc3\xa9 must wait for another episode, because as I’ve said, the uprising in the West was not the only anti-Paris uprising that the National Convention was facing in the spring of 1793.

[(21:28)](#!):

At this same moment, the seeds of the so-called Federalist Revolt were being planted in the East. Now, the Federalist Revolt is really just a catchall label for a bunch of local uprisings that just so happened to share a common enemy, those damned Jacobin radicals in Paris.

[(21:47)](#!):

Because just as those damned Jacobin radicals in Paris were concluding that the only way forward was to centralize all political, military, and economic power, local leaders out in the departments were coming to the opposite conclusion, that the only way forward was to decentralize all political, military, and economic power, to take power away from Paris and invest it in the regional capitals. Two of those regional capitals deserve special attention at this point, Marseille and Lyon.

[(22:19)](#!):

When last we checked in with Marseille, we were talking about a city that was as pro-revolution as any city in France. They were basically operating an independent campaign against counterrevolutionaries down in the Southeast. Their men had stood on the front lines during the insurrection of August the 10th. The great revolutionary anthem was called La Marseillaise. So why are they about to revolt against Paris? What has changed?

[(22:44)](#!):

Well, for one thing, as it turns out, the patriotic leaders of Marseille were simply a superactive minority of hardcore Jacobins who did not necessarily represent the views of the general public. Aristocrats and conservatives had been chased out of public life, and the prominent merchant traders of the great port city had declined to take an active role in government, electing instead to keep their heads down and focused on their businesses. That left a vacuum for the local Jacobin-aligned patriots to step in and run the city as they saw fit. Initially, they were backed by the working classes, who were eager to embrace the great improvements promised by the revolution. But this power dynamic was disrupted by a breakdown of the maritime trade that didn’t just form the basis of the city’s economy. I mean, it was the city’s economy. This all started up first when major disturbances erupted in the colonies that affected both the import and export of goods across the Atlantic. Then when war came, the sea trade was restricted still further. This economic slowdown got the merchants thinking maybe they couldn’t sit on the political sidelines anymore and got the workers thinking that all their previous support for the Jacobins had gotten them was less work and lower wages.

[(23:58)](#!):

So over the winter of 1792-1793, the various sectional assemblies, Marseille having the same municipal setup as Paris, started to be filled by poor workers and rich merchants, both angry about the economic situation and now aligned with each other against the Jacobins. When the National Convention declared war on Britain in February 1793, things were then clearly set to go from bad to worse because the first thing the British did was start up a permanent blockade of the Mediterranean. And since they had the best navy in Europe, that spelled big trouble, possibly fatal trouble for Marseille.

[(24:36)](#!):

Aware that things were starting to get out of control, the local Jacobin leadership followed the lead of Paris and established their own little revolutionary tribunal to arrest suspects. They also authorized the National Guard to march around hunting for any weapons that might be used to help the war effort, and by that we mean not get used against us. And then they also demanded a series of forced loans from the merchants, and none of this was much appreciated by anyone. Then to make matters worse, the representatives on mission, assigned by the convention to Marseille, arrived, took a look around, and endorsed the entire repressive program the Marseille Jacobins had been implementing. This sent the rest of the city into an uproar. The sectional assemblies, now packed with opponents of the Jacobins, started talking amongst themselves, and they decided that they were going to have to take matters into their own hands.

[(25:27)](#!):

But though they despised the arrogant Paris radicals, there was no reason to ignore the super effective way that they had seized power on August the 10th. Clearly copying Danton’s playbook, the Marseille sections formed their own insurrectionary commune, rose up in armed revolt in mid-April, and drove the representatives on mission out of the city. Marseille was suddenly in counter-revolutionary revolt.

[(25:53)](#!):

Further to the north, Marseille was about to be joined in counter-revolutionary revolt by the great manufacturing city of Lyon. Now the cases of Lyon and Marseille are one of those same but different things. Both had economies that hinged on a single major economic engine that was now sputtering badly. But where Marseille’s economy was driven by overseas trade, Lyon’s was driven by the manufacture of silk. It was the main industry of the city, and it was probably the single biggest manufacturing and industry in all of France, and it was not doing well at all.

[(26:31)](#!):

The silk trade had already been taking hits prior to the outbreak of the revolution. It’s one of the reasons so many in the city were so ready to support the convening of the Estates General. But since the revolution, things had only gotten worse. Silk is obviously a luxury good. So what happens to demand when the mere display of luxury goods like silk finery is suddenly enough to get you denounced as a counter-revolutionary pig? That’s right, demand plummets.

[(27:01)](#!):

Well, okay, say the good silk manufacturers of Lyon, that’s not good, but maybe we can hang on, as long as access to our extensive foreign markets aren’t cut off too. What’s that? You’ve just declared war on the whole of Europe and we’re cut off from our foreign markets too? Well, that’s just great. What are we going to do now? Adding to the misery of Lyon’s population was the fact that even the limited resources they had available couldn’t buy up the food and provisions they needed to survive. And that was because the army stationed along the front lines east of the city were gobbling up all the food.

[(27:38)](#!):

Bread riots broke out in September 1792 after prices skyrocketed in the wake of the Allied invasion. And this led directly to a group of hard-line Jacobins riding a wave of anger into power, promising cheap and plentiful bread as soon as they were elected. But once in office, these guys realized that there was no more bread to be had. And even if there was, they didn’t really have any money to pay for it. After a rotten winter, the citizens of Lyon had become pretty well disenchanted with both the leadership of the Jacobins in Lyon and in Paris, who both seemed to be doing everything in their power to drive Lyon into the ground.

[(28:17)](#!):

In late May, another riot broke out, and a food warehouse was ransacked. The local representatives on mission ordered a detachment of regular soldiers in from the front lines to quell the disturbances. But this led to the not unjustified fears that the representatives and their Jacobin allies in the Lyon municipal government were preparing to massacre anyone who opposed them.

[(28:40)](#!):

So the departmental authorities, that is the leaders above Lyon’s Jacobin-controlled municipal government, met on May the 28th and decided to call in the National Guard units that they controlled to do two things. First, restore order in Lyon. And second, toss out the Jacobin government. After literally marching up and evicting the Jacobins from City Hall, a new government of Lyon was convened, one in explicit opposition to Paris. So by the end of May 1793, two of the biggest cities in France, Marseille and Lyon, were in open revolt against the tyranny of Paris.

[(29:20)](#!):

And that was before they found out about the latest Saint-Qilat insurrection in the capital, an insurrection that is usually identified as the cause of the Federalist revolt. And next week, we will head back to Paris to talk about that insurrection. The economic situation in Paris was as bad as it was in Marseille and Lyon. And popular disturbances were now breaking out on a regular basis. But with the national convention meeting right in their backyard, the angry Parisians will focus not on trying to break away from the national authorities, but in overawing them and purging the ranks of the convention of all those who oppose them.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.29, The Purge of the Girondins. As we’ve seen over the last two episodes, the spring of 1793 brought no good news for the revolutionaries running the young French Republic in Paris. Its armies were getting beat out on the frontiers, its provinces were starting to rise up in armed revolt. And as if that was not enough, there was also major trouble right in their own backyard.

[(01:58)](#!):

Paris was not spared the economic troubles that had helped send Marseille and Lyon into insurrection. And so, while the national convention attempted to grapple with some pretty major national emergencies, they had to do so with angry Saint-Qulot standing over their shoulders. And those Saint-Qulot were now moving beyond serving as mere shock troops for the more respectable revolutionaries like Danton and Robespierre, they were starting to develop an independent political program that put them at odds not just with moderate Girondins, but also with the more radical delegates of the Mountain, who had been their allies and their leaders all through the upheavals of 1792.

[(02:36)](#!):

The trouble in Paris began shortly after the king was executed. As we discussed last week, most of the major urban centers of France were dealing with major economic disruptions, and Paris was no exception. Basic commodities like bread, coffee, and sugar were disappearing from the market, prices started going through the roof, and so public protests started up in earnest in February 1793. But it wasn’t just the simple mechanism of supply and demand that was affecting prices. There was also a matter of the collapsing value of the ausseigneur, the revolution’s paper currency. As you might recall, the ausseigneur had begun circulating at the end of 1789, backed by the extensive property of the Catholic Church, property that was in the process of being nationalized. The vast extent of these lands, the expectation that they would fetch a good price at auction, and the promise of further fiscal reforms led the ausseigneur to be treated by France’s creditors as an acceptable form of payment, and so the National Assembly had been able to temporarily solve the debt crisis that had broken the back of the ausseigneur regime.

[(03:42)](#!):

But as the months and then years passed, the value of the ausseigneur steadily eroded. The problem with the currency was that the church lands were becoming a less viable source of revenue. There was so much of it out there on the market that real estate values naturally declined, and then as the expected fiscal reform started to materialize, the tax revenues they generated fell well short of expectations. So by the time the Legislative Assembly took over in October 1791, the ausseigneur was trading at 80% face value, and then over the winter, it plunged down to 60% face value.

[(04:19)](#!):

This destabilization of the Revolution’s money was troubling enough that Brissot and the Girondins made the case for war against Austria in part about strengthening the ausseigneur. A quick and decisive victory would elevate France’s international credibility, all but forcing the other European powers to accept the ausseigneur as a valid form of payment, which would help stabilize its value. The currency did stabilize a bit as a result of the war, and then really got a shot in the arm when the French armies went on the offensive and started acquiring new territory in the fall of 1792, and it had risen back to about 70% of face value by the end of the year. But unfortunately, these gains were undercut because the National Convention was indulging in a pretty counterproductive solution to the problem. If it now took three ausseigneurs to pay for something that used to cost two ausseigneurs, then the answer was simple. You just print more ausseigneurs. But as we all know, and the delegates of the National Convention clearly did not, money itself follows a supply and demand curve, and continuously printing more and more ausseigneurs triggered utterly predictable inflation. By February 1793, an ausseigneur was being accepted at about 50% face value in your average Parisian bakery or grocery shop.

[(05:35)](#!):

Wages, on the other hand, were still being paid out at the nominal face value. This deadly combination of rising prices and falling wages was not going over well in the poorer sections of Paris at all.

[(05:50)](#!):

With the cost of basic necessity suddenly spiraling out of reach, the Paris section sent a deputation to the National Convention on February 12, demanding maximum prices be legally decreed. But even with the bitterly divisive fight over the king having just barely wrapped up, the convention delegates were unified in their opposition to the proposed maximums. Both the Mountain and the Girondins basically supported the continuation of market prices for commodities, because they had more than just the final consumer to worry about. The entire supply chain was feeling the effects of reduced supply and increased inflation, and that was why the final price to the consumer was so high in the first place. To guarantee maximum prices in Paris, the convention would have to basically subsidize every supplier, wholesaler, and transporter as the goods traveled to market. Some subsidizing of grain was already in effect, but it was costing the National Convention a lot of money, and expanding the program would be a fiscal disaster.

[(06:50)](#!):

But the lower classes in Paris didn’t care about that. They were cold, they were starving, and they wanted to be able to afford food again.

[(06:59)](#!):

So rebuked by the convention, the poor Parisians took matters into their own hands. On February 25, a mob of fed-up wives and mothers stormed grocery stores across the city, selling off the inventory to each other at what they considered to be fair prices. Then they dutifully handed the proceeds of these forced sales over to the beleaguered shopkeepers, who were of course now ruined because they had paid double what they had just been handed to get the stuff there in the first place. The National Guard fanned out in force and successfully quieted the streets, but the poor sections were just getting warmed up, and they were now egged on by a much harder core group of leaders. The original cohort of radicals in the Courtauld district, specifically the group surrounding Danton, had now graduated off to running the National Convention. And while they were busy running the nation, the leadership of the Courtauld Club passed in the hands of even more radical agitators.

[(07:56)](#!):

Among the most prominent of these new agitators was Jacques Roux, a Catholic priest who had settled in one of the poorest Paris sections after the Revolution got going and quickly became a tireless advocate for the poor. As a political force, he really started to come into his own back in the spring of 1792, when he was always out on the front lines demonstrating against the king. Always ready with the most extreme answer to any problem, Roux’s reaction to the rising prices in Paris was to demand the death penalty for anyone caught hoarding goods.

[(08:30)](#!):

Also among the new breed of street leaders was Jean-Francois Vardelay, who had set up a box just outside the convention to harangue anyone who happened to be passing by about the need for radical economic and social reform. Then there was Th\xc3\xa9ophile Leclerc, who had served in the army and fought at the Battle of G\xc3\xa9mat, and was now back in Paris promoting a brand of hardline radical populism that called for mass purgings of the government and the army of anyone suspected of not being 100% committed to the Revolution. He was joined in this endeavor by Claire Lacombe, a former actress who had herself fought on the front lines on August 10th and taken a bullet through the arm for her troubles. Along with Pauline Lyon, Lacombe would form the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women in March 1793, possibly because they had gotten it into their pretty little heads that all this talk of liberty and equality actually applied to women too.

[(09:27)](#!):

Collectively, this new breed of agitators were dubbed the enrag\xc3\xa9s, variously translated as the madmen, the enraged ones, the angry ones, obviously a derogatory name given to them by more respectable revolutionaries.

[(09:43)](#!):

Though they were as haphazardly organized as any of the alleged parties during the Revolutionary era and were often at odds with each other, the enrag\xc3\xa9s did share a brand of aggressive equalitarianism that usually gets them described as either proto-socialists or proto-anarchists. They did not believe private property was a core component of political liberty. They believed it was an instrument of political oppression, and they wanted to see it abolished. As for the enlightened rights of man, well, missing from its tenants was the simple right to exist. They believed that government should be empowered to take from those who had and give to those who had not to guarantee that right of existence. They also tended to share a belief that the Revolution could only succeed if all the traitors and foot-draggers and secret royalists were exposed and purged.

[(10:35)](#!):

The enrag\xc3\xa9s were coming out so far to the left that on their list of counter-revolutionary suspects included the now thoroughly left-wing Jacobin Club. It remained to be seen whether the Jacobins would be able to demonstrate enough revolutionary purity to save themselves from the coming storm engineered by the enrag\xc3\xa9s.

[(10:56)](#!):

For the moment, though, the rage of the enrag\xc3\xa9s was focused almost exclusively on the faction that had demonstrated nothing but revolutionary impurity of late, the Girondins. And it’s not like the Girondins weren’t asking for it. Ever since the National Convention had gathered, the Girondin delegates had set themselves up as enemies of Paris. They claimed the Parisians posed a threat to the convention. They had called on the provincials to come protect them from the Parisians. They had attempted to move the convention out of Paris altogether. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, these guys had just tried to use every trick in the book to get that damned traitor Louis Capet off the hook.

[(11:37)](#!):

When news started hitting Paris in February and then March 1793 about nationwide resistance to the draft and a full-on uprising in the Vaud\xc3\xa9, it all seemed to add up to the provincials finally taking up the Girondin call to revolt against Paris. Clearly, if the revolution was going to succeed, the Girondins were going to have to go.

[(11:60)](#!):

So on the night of March 9th, the same night that the convention had created the Revolutionary Tribunal and the representatives on mission, mobs of Saint-Qulot marched around breaking Girondin newspaper presses. And then on the morning of March 10th, a few thousand gathered outside the convention to demand that 22 specifically named Girondin deputies be expelled from the convention, including Jacques-Pierre Brissot and former mayor of Paris, Jerome Petillon. But the time was not yet ripe for purging, and when 9,000 National Guard arrived on the scene, the mob melted away.

[(12:36)](#!):

Inside the convention, the shaken Girondins went on the offensive to defend themselves. They quickly returned to the theme that they had opened the convention with, that Robespierre and the mountain were conspiring to have us killed by a mob. This latest attempt on our lives is just that, the latest attempt.

[(12:55)](#!):

But this characterization of events was swiftly rebutted by Robespierre himself, who took to the floor to openly denounce the demonstrators for illegally attempting to interfere in the sovereignty of the convention. And Robespierre was not being disingenuous. He had had nothing to do with the mob showing up, and was uncomfortable with the idea of these armed crowds dictating terms to the convention. It was one thing for noble patriots to rise up and overthrow a treasonous king. It was quite another to threaten the duly elected representatives of the nation. Robespierre was not yet ready to let his principles give way to the political threat posed by the Enrag\xc3\xa9e.

[(13:36)](#!):

Failing to bust Robespierre, the Girondins then turned on Danton. It was an odd time to go after Danton, since he too had had nothing to do with the aborted insurrection of March the 10th. As I mentioned, Danton had spent the winter bouncing back and forth between Paris and Belgium, trying to consolidate the revolution’s advance on the frontier.

[(13:57)](#!):

Not only did this disconnect him from the Paris streets, but it’s also clear that after the run of events from the insurrection of August the 10th through the September massacres, that Danton was deliberately stepping back from the radical fringe. He was now positioning himself as an intermediary between all the rival revolutionary factions. What he wanted now was revolutionary unity and mutual understanding.

[(14:22)](#!):

Now that didn’t mean he was going soft. And when he voted for the establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunal, he famously said that it was important for the government to be terrible so that the people wouldn’t have to be. But he was talking about dealing with royalist rebels and defiant priests, not committed revolutionaries who just happened to disagree with you on some particular issue. But while up in Belgium, Danton’s desire for unity was possibly blinding him to the signals emanating from General Dumourieu that he was about to turn traitor.

[(14:56)](#!):

Danton had been trying to coax the unhappy general back into the fold, while simultaneously sending letters back to his convention colleagues explaining why Dumourieu was still cool. When Dumourieu did defect, it then looked like Danton had been covering for a traitor the whole time.

[(15:13)](#!):

In an attempt to capitalize on this, and probably deflect attention from their very own close ties to Dumourieu, the Girondins tried to impeach Danton for high treason and send him off to be judged by the Revolutionary Tribunal. The court charge was failing to arrest Dumourieu even after it was clear that Dumourieu needed to be arrested. But they also threw in some stuff about Danton personally enriching himself while in Belgium, and possibly trying to make himself a French version of Oliver Cromwell. These charges were met by an incredulous and thundering defense from Danton on April 1 that quite easily carried the day.

[(15:52)](#!):

Not only did the convention not vote to impeach him, they appointed Danton to the newly created Committee of Public Safety, a committee that included no Girondin delegates, because that’s the way the winds are now blowing. In defiance of these winds, the Girondins then decided to go after some lower-hanging fruit, and they turned their guns on a man who was disliked by just about everyone in the convention, including Robespierre and Danton, Jean-Paul Marat.

[(16:23)](#!):

Now serving as president of the Jacobin Club on top of everything else, Marat had signed a circular letter inviting the departments to recall or dismiss any deputy who had voted for the appeal to the people at the very end of the king’s trial. The Girondins seized on it as a pretext to impeach Marat and send him to the Revolutionary Tribunal.

[(16:44)](#!):

The vote to impeach Marat succeeded where the vote to impeach Danton failed because first, as I just said, Marat was not very popular within the convention, whatever his standing was out on the street, and second, those who might have supported him, that is, the hardcore of the mountain, well, they had all been volunteering to serve as representatives on mission and were now away from the convention.

[(17:07)](#!):

But the impeachment of Marat turned out to be a huge mistake for the Girondins. After a very public trial that saw daily massings of Enrag\xc3\xa9 Saint-Culot parading in support of their hero and calling for the expulsion of the Girondins, Marat was completely acquitted on April 24. The Saint-Culot literally carried him away on their shoulders in triumph. This little referendum on who truly represented the revolution could not have been more decisive. Bloodthirsty advocate of wholesale slaughter, yes. Moderate Republicans, no.

[(17:45)](#!):

It did not take long for the delegates of the mountain to determine that they were either going to have to align themselves with the Saint-Culot or risk getting tossed out with the Girondins. So on May 4, they successfully steered through the convention the Maximum on Grains, also known as the First Maximum because there will be others. This established a ceiling on grain prices that would be enforced by all departmental authorities. The Girondins, unwilling to yield, vigorously opposed the measure, which was no doubt much appreciated by the mountain. You see angry Parisian street mobs? Those are the guys you want. We’re on your side.

[(18:25)](#!):

Aware that some kind of reckoning was on the way, the Girondins hunkered down to make a fight of it. On May 10, they managed to convince the convention to establish what would quickly be dubbed the Commission of Twelve, a committee who would investigate threats to the convention posed by the radical sections of Paris. The membership of the commission was packed with Girondins. They believed that there was a conspiracy afoot inside the radical sections not just to purge the Girondins, but to dissolve the convention itself. They aimed to root out this conspiracy and destroy it.

[(18:58)](#!):

On May the 24th, the Commission of Twelve made its first move, ordering the arrest of Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Varlet and a radical journalist named Jacques-Ren\xc3\xa9 Hubert, who was not generally lumped in with the Enrag\xc3\xa9, but who had spilled a lot of ink lately denouncing the Girondins in terms that would make Marat himself blush. The arrest of these two provoked immediate protests from the Paris sections, who were then further provoked when a Girondin orator took to the floor of the convention the next day and said that if the sections weren’t careful that the rest of France would rise up and literally annihilate Paris and that later men would search the banks of the Seine in vain for signs of the city.

[(19:39)](#!):

These were fighting words, and the Enrag\xc3\xa9 were absolutely spoiling for that fight.

[(19:47)](#!):

After that, things pretty much descended into chaos. Believing now that the Girondins were beyond saving, Robespierre took to the floor of the Jacobin Club on May the 26th and endorsed the call for Paris to rise up against the corrupt and irredeemable Girondin deputies. The next day a session of the convention was invaded by angry Parisians, and the few delegates who did not flee voted to abolish the Commission of Twelve and then release Varlet and Hubert. The day after that, though, order was restored, and the besieged Girondins were able to engineer the reinstatement of the Commission of Twelve, though the release of Varlet and Hubert was ratified. Once released, Varlet set to work organizing a new insurrectionary commune that wound up representing 33 of the city’s 48 sections.

[(20:36)](#!):

Meeting at the former palace of an archbishop, this new insurrectionary commune set itself up in opposition not just to the national convention, but also to the old insurrectionary convention, the one that had stormed to power on August the 10th, but which was now seen by the enrag\xc3\xa9e as insufficiently patriotic because things move very fast in the French Revolution.

[(20:60)](#!):

On the morning of Friday, May the 31st, the new insurrectionary commune launched an armed uprising. As luck would have it, the second-in-command of the Paris National Guard, a guy named Francois Henriault, was sympathetic to the insurrection, and with the overall commander of the Paris National Guard having just ridden off to help fight rebels in the Vaudet, Henriault took charge of the National Guard and deployed it in favor of the insurrection.

[(21:27)](#!):

The insurrectionaries marched first on the general council of the Paris Commune, barged into the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, and declared the Commune deposed and then began issuing its demands. The exclusion of all named Girondins from the national convention, the abolishing of the Commission of Twelve, the immediate arrest of all counter-revolutionary suspects, a systematic purge of all government agencies, the establishment of a revolutionary army composed of sans-culottes who would enforce revolutionary decrees like the maximum on grain, bread prices to be fixed at a reasonable rate, expanded aid to the poor and needy and families of soldiers, and then finally voting rights only for sans-culottes.

[(22:10)](#!):

Only after the Commune agreed to go along with all the insurrectionaries’ demands were they allowed to continue their sitting. The government of Paris thus cowed, the mob then marched down to the convention and issued the same demands, couching it all as a response to a vast conspiracy that they had uncovered that threatened the nation.

[(22:30)](#!):

To their great credit, the Girondins did not duck out the back door. Instead, they defiantly stood their ground, and their courage was probably bolstered by the fact that the insurrection had in fact been very ill-timed. Friday was a work day, so the angry mob that showed up at the convention’s doorstep was intimidating, but not overwhelmingly so. As the day progressed and the convention debated what to do, the strength of the mob diminished as men and women drifted home.

[(23:01)](#!):

At the end of the day, the question of the alleged conspiracy and the proper response to it were referred to the Committee of Public Safety. The Girondins lived to fight another day. But they did not live to fight another two days.

[(23:18)](#!):

Obviously, the result of the May 31st uprising was unsatisfactory to the Enrag\xc3\xa9 leaders. So two days later, on Sunday, June 2nd, this time not a work day, they relaunched the insurrection. And this time, somewhere in the neighborhood of 80,000 people turned out, and almost all of them were armed. At their head were the mobilized companies of the Parisian National Guard, under the command of Francois Henriault.

[(23:46)](#!):

Once they arrived at the convention, a group of petitioners pushed their way in to demand action against the alleged conspiracy that they had uncovered. A brief war of oratory was then waged between the Mountain and the Girondins that actually saw the Girondins get the better of it. And once again, the petition was referred to the Committee of Public Safety. The convention delegates quickly discovered, though, that they were not going to get out of it that easy. When one of their members tried to leave the hall, he came back in a few minutes later and said, guys, they’re not going to let us leave.

[(24:20)](#!):

This sent waves of indignation through the convention, as even Danton demanded that the freedom of the House not be so nakedly abused. When the president of the convention sent a message to Henriault to stand down, Henriault said some very naughty words, and then ordered cannons aimed at the doors.

[(24:38)](#!):

This prompted about 100 delegates then to leave the hall altogether as a group, hoping to force Henriault to let them pass. But the National Guard commander refused to stand aside. So instead, the delegates walked a circuit of the building, saw that it was surrounded by an armed mob of Parisians who had blocked all possible exits, and then they headed back inside where it was time to start capitulating. Though most of the delegates abstained in protest, the convention voted to indict 29 Girondin deputies, plus a few non-deputy ministers, and then commit them all to house arrest.

[(25:15)](#!):

The Rolland’s husband and wife probably would have made the list too, but Madame Rolland had already been arrested by the Parisian authorities on the night of May 31, and her husband had gone into hiding. By a naked show of force, the streets of Paris had just asserted that they were the true masters of revolutionary France. The response to all this out in the departments was immediate, rebellious outrage. Lyon and Marseille were of course already in a state of revolt, and they were now joined by other major provincial cities.

[(25:49)](#!):

First up, not surprisingly, was Bordeaux. Bordeaux was the major city of the Girond, so you can imagine their indignation when they heard the news that lower-class yahoos in Paris had just expelled their representatives from the national convention. Bordeaux had been getting hit just as hard as Marseille by maritime trade disruptions, but they had not yet gone into full-on revolt. When Paris arrested their guys, though, Bordeaux went into full-on revolt. On June 7, the city declared itself in insurrection against the national convention, which quite literally no longer represented them.

[(26:26)](#!):

Bordeaux then sent delegations out to other cities, calling on them all to first, elect a shadow national convention that would meet anywhere but Paris, and second, raise an armed force at least 80,000 strong to march on the capital and bring the Parisians to heel. This call was heeded in the north by the Norman city of Caen, and the Breton city of Rennes, and then down in the southeast most fatefully by the Mediterranean port city of Toulon, which happened to house France’s naval dockyard. And it’s really not good when the city that houses your navy goes into revolt.

[(27:05)](#!):

As I said last week, this wave of declarations against Paris has been dubbed the Federalist Revolt. Federalism in this case meaning a movement to decentralize power, as opposed to the old American federalism, which was a movement to centralize power.

[(27:21)](#!):

But though they are now in revolt against radical Paris, in many ways the Federalists were more revolutionary than the Parisians. Because when you look at the program that has been emerging from the capital these last few months, forced conscription, committees of surveillance, arbitrary tribunals, attacks on freedom of the press, price controls, a general police state watched over by representatives on mission with unlimited powers, I mean none of that is what the revolution was supposed to have been about. Every single part of it was just a recasting of the most despotic elements of the Ancien regime. So who was really the counter-revolutionary here? Both sides of course pointed to the other guys.

[(28:06)](#!):

Back in Paris, the Saint-Cue lot went back to work, and the convention delegates tried to manage the fallout from the insurrection.

[(28:14)](#!):

A 75 delegate signed an official protest against the purge of the Girondins. There is no reason to believe that most of those signatures did not simply represent principled rejection of the idea that armed mobs could just expel representatives that had been legally elected. But when the terror picks up, every one of those signatures would stand as proof enough of complicity in some far-reaching Girondin plot, and they too would be arrested for their alleged crimes. The prescribed Girondins, meanwhile, sat under a very loose house arrest that was only tightened when a few of them, including Jerome Petillon, got up and walked out the door one day, eventually surfacing up in Normandy.

[(28:57)](#!):

The delegates of the mountain, meanwhile, couldn’t quite bring themselves to bask in the glow of their final victory over the Girondins. No, they did not like those guys, but their alliance with the Enrag\xc3\xa9s was something of an embarrassment. Though they were clearly the beneficiaries of the insurrection, that did not mean they really wanted to encourage lawless upheavals like this. And as we’ll see once the terror gets going, Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety would be as quick to use La Guillotine against radical populace in the streets as they were to use it against some aristocratic swine.

[(29:34)](#!):

For the moment, though, the mountain tried to co-op some of the Enrag\xc3\xa9 demands, and hopefully keep the streets mollified. The convention voted to enroll that so-called Revolutionary Army, which was really just organized bands of Saint-Qilat, to enforce things like the maximum on grains. That would hopefully keep them occupied.

[(29:54)](#!):

They also voted to spend every working day working on the thing that was supposed to have been the whole reason the convention had been called in the first place. I mean, does anyone out there even remember why the convention had been called? That’s right, to draft a new constitution. Well, here we are eight months later, and virtually nothing had been done about that new constitution. So next time, the convention will finally produce that new constitution, dubbed by history the Constitution of 1793.

[(30:27)](#!):

That constitution wound up being far more egalitarian and democratic than just about anything that had come before it in world history. It’s a pretty stunning document in terms of the political access it granted, and the breadth of the rights it guaranteed. But the funny thing about the Constitution of 1793 was that as idealistic as it was, and as popular as it was, it was never actually implemented. The moment it was ratified, it was set aside. The threats facing France were determined to be too dire to abandon the emergency revolutionary government currently in place.

[(31:03)](#!):

Led by the Committee of Public Safety, that revolutionary government was attempting to navigate the multiple crises that threatened to destroy France. And by navigate, I of course mean cut off as many heads as possible and hope for the best. But it will be two weeks before we pick up that story. Because when you add up all the episodes from the history of Rome and revolutions and exclude the supplementals, next week’s episode turns out to be my 250th career podcast episode, which is pretty crazy. That’s a big number for one guy, one computer, and a pile of books. So to celebrate, next week will be question time, where I will answer questions about Rome, the revolutions we’ve covered so far, my work process, and where I’d like to go if I have a time machine. Hint, it’s not Paris in the spring of 1793.

[(02:07)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.30, the 250th episode.

[(02:25)](#!):

So I just went back and reread what I wrote at the beginning of the hundredth episode of The History of Rome. I expressed some surprise that I was still working on the show three years after I started it and said some stuff about how I had no idea I would ever get near a hundred episodes. The transcript at that point stood at 390,000 words and 34 total hours of audio content, and apparently we weren’t even to Marcus Aurelius yet. Well, here we are now seven and a half years after the release of the first episode of The History of Rome. I am very, very surprised to find myself still doing this. The combined transcripts of The History of Rome and Revolutions now stand at 976,000 words with 102 total hours of content.

[(03:11)](#!):

Yikes. And we’re not even to the reign of terror yet. So I’ll echo today another thing that I said then, which is how long will it take me to complete Revolutions? I no longer have any idea. I won’t make predictions anymore, but I sure hope everyone is enjoying the French Revolution because we still have a long ways to go. Though I do promise that next week we are going to break out of the infinity loop that is the spring of 1793.

[(03:38)](#!):

This week, of course, we are celebrating the occasion of my 250th podcast episode by opening the floor up to questions \xe2\x80\x93 questions being asked by those good listeners who spent more than $150 during the recent fundraiser, which went great, and everyone should now have everything that they ordered. If for some reason you have not received your order yet or received the wrong merchandise, please email me back by the end of the week \xe2\x80\x93 that is, March 22, 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 so we can get it straightened out. Just email me at revolutionspodcast at gmail dot com. After March 22, we are going to smash the print screens to ensure that this round of shirts remain the limited-edition collector’s items that I promised they would be.

[(04:19)](#!):

Okay, we have a lot of questions to get to today, so let’s get to it. Presented here in the order in which they were received \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Manfred, that means you are last. So first question is from Robert Prigg \xe2\x80\x93 given the choice of any historical figure, whom would you want as a dinner guest, and why?

[(04:39)](#!):

So I’ve probably gushed way too much about Talleyrand already, so I won’t say Talleyrand, even though he’d be a really good answer. By all accounts, he was a magnetic conversationalist, and I’m sure dinner with Talleyrand would be epically entertaining. But I wouldn’t want him to be my guest so much as I would want to be his. Talleyrand was famous for his devotion to fine dining, and he actually played a pretty huge role in the advancement of modern French cuisine. He would sure give me a better meal than I would ever give him.

[(05:10)](#!):

So Talleyrand aside, I think an evening with David Hume would have to be the answer. As I’ll discuss more in a little bit, I studied political theory and philosophy as an undergrad, and as I plugged my way through the history of Western philosophy \xe2\x80\x93 Plato and Aquinas and Locke \xe2\x80\x93 I always absorbed the various arguments and made sure I understood them. But as interesting as it all was from a historical perspective, none of it really ever captured me. And then I got to Hume. David Hume was the first guy I ever read and said, holy crap, I think this guy might be onto something. No one can cut through bullshit faster and with more precision than David Hume, and he’s as close to an intellectual hero as I’ll ever have. The world would do well to read a lot more David Hume, so I would love to just sit and talk with him about whatever happens to be on his mind. And of course, being an 18th-century Scotsman, he probably won’t complain about the food.

[(06:05)](#!):

Okay, next question is from Louis. We have all heard that those who do not study history are destined to repeat it. Can you point to an example where today’s revolutionaries, reactionaries, etc. are repeating the mistakes of history unlearned? Any examples of lessons that appear to have been learned, thus leading to more successful revolutions, counter revolutions, or defenses against revolutions today?

[(06:28)](#!):

Well, I don’t know which exact mistakes per se are being repeated, but you can see all over the Arab world right now how quickly an uprising opposed to despotism and vocally promoting democratic participation slides seamlessly into ultra-radical cliques grabbing power and instituting their own preferred brand of despotism. I think, for example, that everything that has happened in Egypt over the last few years has been painfully easy to predict.

[(06:57)](#!):

As for the reactionaries or counter-revolutionaries, there is a real danger to putting off necessary and obviously needed reforms for too long. I think a lot about the last few generations of Roman senators, how intransigent and hostile they were to making even the slightest nod in the direction of addressing the vast array \xe2\x80\x93 social and economic and political complaints that were sweeping through Italy in the first century BC. If you make a few voluntary reforms early in the process, you can utterly deflate brewing insurrections, and even get credit for your enlightened benevolence.

[(07:30)](#!):

But wait too long, and suddenly you’re a villain who must be destroyed. I think there is a major test coming for the elites of the post-industrialized West about the very real problem of growing economic inequality. And economic inequality is not a problem because it’s not fair, it’s a problem because it’s starting to become a major drag on the world economy, and a major hindrance to the continued legitimacy of the system. The preposterous imbalance of the distribution of global wealth is going to have to be dealt with eventually. The only question is how drastic and violent the solution will be. So will the elites give a little today to keep a lot tomorrow, or do they give nothing today, and find themselves lined up against a wall tomorrow? Right now, it’s their choice. Down the road, it probably won’t be.

[(08:21)](#!):

Dave Webster asks how come you’ve never sold the show, for example, 99 cents per episode or $10 per revolution? I imagine your fanbase is quite substantial, and this type of costing approach would bring in a pretty healthy income. Have you considered this as an option for the future to keep you in the podcasting business?

[(08:39)](#!):

When I started The History of Rome, I had a full-time job. The podcast was a hobby. There was no need to make money at it. Then I started getting some ad revenue, and The History of Rome became half a job, and I was able to cut back my hours at the day job, and I was perfectly content with that. I always wanted to err on the side of not wrecking the listener base by throwing stuff behind a paywall. I still think putting episodes behind a paywall is a quick way to kill everything I’ve built. But that said, I am getting better at the monetization thing. The ads are working, the fundraiser worked, the tours are working. The option of putting select bonus material up for purchase is always a viable option, and I’ll almost certainly do that this year, but I’ve always run into problems finding the time to write the bonus material. I put a lot of time into each episode. So I can’t change the past, nor do I want to, but going forward, I will be a better capitalist, I promise.

[(09:36)](#!):

John Newton asks, who influenced you in the design, presentation, pace, style, and humor in podcasting for both The History of Rome and Revolutions? Was there a new source of inspiration in Revolutions? Were there earlier history podcasts before The History of Rome, or did television and radio from PBS or NPR or the BBC influence you?

[(09:57)](#!):

Longtime listeners of the show know that the first podcast I listened to that knocked my socks off and really got me into the game was 12 Byzantine Rulers by Lars Brownworth, so I won’t repeat myself on that. Instead, I’ll talk about two TV shows I discovered more than a decade ago that really influenced my approach to presenting history. The first is Simon Schama’s A History of Britain. I stumbled across it one weekend back in 2001 when it was running as a marathon on the History Channel, back when the History Channel actually showed history, and I didn’t leave the couch for like two days. I was hooked. The idea of telling a huge historical story in one continuous narrative with one single voice clearly got into me, because that’s essentially what the history of Rome turned out to be. In that same vein, there is also this totally obscure old series from the late 1980s called The Western Tradition, produced by Annenberg and hosted by UCLA professor Eugene Weber. It covered the entire history of Western civilization in 52 half-hour-long episodes, so it was the same thing. Huge historical story, one continuous narrative. It used to come on Oregon Public Broadcasting at super random times, sometimes in mid-afternoon, other times at like three in the morning. Any time I managed to hit it, it was like winning the Channel Flipping Lottery. You can Google it and watch them all for free now. It’s called The Western Tradition. It is highly recommended.

[(11:25)](#!):

Andy Schwartz asks, do you have any recommendations for sources of information on the history of Rome that would be appropriate for young children? That is really hard. I have occasionally toyed with the idea of writing stuff for kids myself, but whenever I do it’s always like, okay, and then what happened next is that Octavian and Mark Antony got together and decided to murder a bunch of people and take all their stuff. Or like, boy, the Punic Wars sure were exciting, 50,000 men were hacked to death in a single day.

[(11:55)](#!):

Caracalla? Oh yeah, he was a bad emperor. He stabbed his brother to death right in front of their mother. Roman history is the stuff of nightmares. That said, I do think that the Horrible History series does a good job wrapping up all the terrible bloodiness with enough humor to keep it from being too traumatic. My own first serious encounter with Roman history came from a 1987 world book encyclopedia and that was all pretty antiseptic, so maybe you could try that.

[(12:24)](#!):

Sam Wigginton asks, your ability to both comprehend and explain in clear terms such complex historical events causes me feelings of inadequacy. Is there anything you suck at? And I don’t mean like, I can never quite nail the first movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14, which for the record I know I cannot quite nail. I mean, a common skill that you’re embarrassingly bad at or a subject that you’re shamefully ignorant of, it would help me feel better about myself and my own modest abilities.

[(12:52)](#!):

I am not handy at all. I once called a repair guy because the furnace broke, he swapped out the filter, and charged me 50 bucks. We just moved into a new house and I was very proud of myself for installing some coat hangers in the mudroom. Three days later, the whole thing fell off the wall. Mrs. Revolutions is the go-to misfixit in our house. Civilization collapses and you’re looking for somebody to join your team to help you stay alive, you want her and not me. Will Weinberg asks, in your opinion, how many distinct revolutions did Rome experience before the fall of the Western Empire? And are there any similarities which you would draw with the three revolutions you have covered in the new series?

[(13:34)](#!):

In my opinion, there were three big Roman revolutions. First, the expulsion of the kings and the founding of the Republic around 509 BC. That’s the move obviously from monarchy to republic. Second, the collapse of the republic and the rise of the Caesars. That’s the move from Republic to Principate. Third, the whole process of the crisis of the third century, culminating with the great reorganizing reforms of Diocletian. That’s the move from Principate to dominate. Clearly, of those three, the first is the most relevant to revolutions. Tossing out the king and founding a republic, though interestingly enough, overthrowing the monarchy and founding a kingless republic appears to have been the expressed intention only of the Romans. As we’ve seen, not the English, nor the Americans, nor the French were really aiming at starting up a republic from the beginning of their revolution. It’s just sort of something that happened along the way.

[(14:30)](#!):

Steve O. from Philly asks, Could you please tell me a fun fact about the history of Philadelphia that isn’t widely known, or anything about its role in the revolution that didn’t make it into the podcast? I’d love to know more about my city.

[(14:43)](#!):

I will probably have a way better answer for you a couple months from now once I’m back from the first American Revolution tour. But you should probably at some point drop by the Powell House, at 244 South Third Street. It’s described as the residence of Revolutionary-era mayor Samuel Powell, but I don’t really care about him. I care about his wife Elizabeth Powell, who was clearly the intellectual and social powerhouse in the family. I would guess that just about every major revolutionary figure passed through their house at some point or another, and Elizabeth became a very close confidant of George Washington when the Constitutional Convention came to town. She is also the one who allegedly asked Benjamin Franklin whether the convention had produced a monarchy or a republic. Anyway, I think Elizabeth Powell was a totally cool lady. Her old house is now a museum, and you should probably go visit it.

[(15:36)](#!):

I think I actually just talked myself into doing the same when I’m in Philadelphia. David Whalen asks, My son and I are going to be visiting Rome in late March. What thing or things would you recommend seeing in the area of Rome that are not commonly on tourist itineraries?

[(15:52)](#!):

My favorite part of the History of Rome tour itinerary was the day that we got outside of Rome itself. We would spend the morning at Ostia Antica and the afternoon at Hadrian’s Villa. Both are pretty incredible archaeological sites and totally undervisited. I never really saw more than a couple dozen people at either site. I mean, Rome is a fantastic city, but it’s nice to get away from the chaos, relax a bit, enjoy some fresh air, get away from the tourists and the noise, and just meander through some old ruins. So go visit Ostia Antica and Hadrian’s Villa. You will not regret it.

[(16:29)](#!):

Cliff Gallaher asks, How much did the rhetoric of the English Civil War and the American Revolution circulate during the French Revolution? Were the Jacobins quoting the levelers, or was anyone other than Lafayette espousing the thinking of Jefferson, Madison, and the framers of the American Republic?

[(16:46)](#!):

So far as I can tell, the English Revolution had very little impact on the French Revolution. The Jacobins were not quoting the levelers. The one recurring reference to the English Revolution that I’ve seen is that the French revolutionaries often accused each other of wanting to be Cromwell. I mean, we just saw the Girondins accused Anton of wanting to be Cromwell. Obviously that was an insult rather than a compliment, even amongst those who had just voted to send Louis to the guillotine. I did think, though, that it was really interesting how much Louis seemed to be studying up on the life of King Charles, both in trying to avoid the mistakes Charles made, and then after Louis was condemned on how to die like a king.

[(17:27)](#!):

As for the Americans, nearly all the French revolutionaries supported the American Revolution \xe2\x80\x94 at least those old enough to have had an opinion about it. And there was, of course, a cohort of liberal nobles \xe2\x80\x94 particularly those who had served in the American War of Independence, with Lafayette being the most prominent \xe2\x80\x94 who admired and actively promoted American-style republicanism. As we all know, Benjamin Franklin was a rock star during his time in Paris, and Thomas Jefferson enjoyed a certain amount of cachet, and he obviously helped Lafayette draft the Declaration of the Rights of Man. But once the French Revolution really gets going after Louis is dragged back from Versailles, the American Revolution stops being a leading light. So in the early days, yeah, there were a lot of references to the American Revolution. And remember, there was some real giddiness in the National Assembly about getting the opportunity to denounce a stamp duty, just like the heroic Americans.

[(18:22)](#!):

But after 1789, the references really start to peter out, as the French push off into uncharted waters. Tom Harrigan asks, Of the various revolutions you have covered, and those that you plan to cover, which revolution do you believe has had the greatest and longest-lasting historical significance?

[(18:43)](#!):

Well the answer to that has to be the French Revolution. The French Revolution is the Great Revolution. But aside from all the big sweeping changes and the generation-long blunder that it threw Europe into, there is a more subtle reason that I think is worth highlighting. The French Revolution bequeathed unto the world this thing called the professional revolutionary \xe2\x80\x93 these cliques of intellectuals and dissidents and agitators whose whole existence is dedicated to overthrowing whatever regime happens to be in power.

[(19:13)](#!):

Before the French Revolution, there’s really no such thing as a professional revolutionary. After the French Revolution, you find these guys loitering around every coffee shop in every country in the world, usually sporting goatees and smoking a lot of cigarettes. Sometimes, if they’re feeling up to it, they actually even get something going. Mostly they don’t, though, and just talk a lot of talk. But the French Revolution is the reason those guys exist. Berlin would not have been Lenin had Danton not been Danton.

[(19:44)](#!):

Jake Lurch asks, Do you have a favorite anecdote, myth, rumor that you found funny or interesting that couldn’t fit into the narrative, either the history of Rome or revolutions?

[(19:56)](#!):

There is a great little story in H.W. Brand’s biography of Benjamin Franklin. Around the time of the Treaty of Paris negotiations, Franklin was playing a game of chess. His opponent checked Franklin’s king. But instead of doing anything about it, Franklin ignored the check and made a move elsewhere on the board. The opponent said, Hey, you can’t do that. You have to deal with your king, to which Franklin replied, I see that he is in check, but I shall not defend him. If he was a good king, like yours, he would deserve the protection of his subjects. But he is a tyrant and has cost them already more than he is worth. Take him, if you please. I can do without him, and will fight the rest of the battle en republiquant.

Aaron Kotkin asks, You sometimes mention that you study political theory as an undergrad. As a political theorist myself, I was wondering, who is your favorite political theorist and, of course, why? I have a great deal of affection for the Utilitarians \xe2\x80\x94 Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, properly modified by John Stuart Mill, of course. Of all the great theorists, they seem to be the ones actually trying to do something besides just sit around philosophizing. They were practical reformers trying to build up an intellectual apparatus to move society in a positive direction. I really admire what they were trying to do, and I think that they did a lot of good.

[(21:18)](#!):

The other guy that I should mention, though, is Montesquieu. Though not for the stuff he is generally celebrated for \xe2\x80\x94 the separation of powers and all that. Once you get through all the well-tread bits of the spirit of the laws, you get into this relatively neglected section, where Montesquieu attempts to link political and social variations to environmental climate. The Swiss act like this because they live up in the mountains, the Italians act like that because they live out on a temperate peninsula, the Dutch live below sea level and that’s why they’re all bankers. My brain really latched onto this idea, and I’ve never really been able to let it go. Even though when you actually try to truly isolate the variables, it all falls apart. Because you wind up talking, not about people, but cardboard cutouts. These excitable Italians are always gesticulating wildly because it’s sunny outside. I still think there’s something to it in theory, but it never seems to pan out in practice. And I’m now far more interested in the effects of the built environment on political culture than regional distinctions. If I were told that I had to guess a total stranger’s political views based off of one variable, I would not say, oh, do they live in a valley or do they live up on a mountain? I would say, do they live in a rural environment or an urban environment? That isn’t going to guarantee a correct answer, but knowing that gives you a real solid shot at at least guessing in the right direction.

Nathan Clifford says, I don’t have a question, but if there is a question you wish somebody had asked and nobody did, feel free to pretend like I asked it. I wish somebody had asked me if it’s true that I dream of resurrecting Steve Allen’s old show Meeting of Minds. The answer is yes. Yes, I do. The first episode featuring Julius Caesar, Machiavelli, JP Morgan, and Diane Fosse discussing the meaning of power. Mark Armstrong asks, what sort of preparation is required so that you can narrate each episode clearly and smoothly without a stumble?

[(23:20)](#!):

The answer to that is that I write everything in advance. The vast majority of my work is writing and editing the scripts. Actually reading it and recording it only takes about an hour. And for the record, I stumble all the time. I should really put together an outtake reel sometime because I get pretty colorful about the fourth time I can’t get a sentence right.

[(23:40)](#!):

Okay, the next question is from Chris Jones, who purchased my copy of Eusebius’s Church History. And I wrote in it that I never realized how endlessly fascinating early Church history was, which is true. Early Church history never ceases to entertain me. So Chris asks, have there been other subtopics you’ve run across when preparing both the history of Rome and Revolutions that had depths that interested you that you did not expect? And was there anything that you were really looking forward to learning about that was disappointing, or not as interesting as you had hoped?

[(24:13)](#!):

Well the crisis of the third century is the big one. Going into the history of Rome, I was very well versed in the entire Republican period and most of the early imperium. But the later you got, the less I knew. And like most people, all I ever really knew about the period between the Savarins and Diocletian was that it got pretty messy for about 50 years. Once I started unpacking it, I was blown away by how interesting it was. There is just so, so much good stuff that happens. Truly. That period from AD 235 to 284 was the great find of the series, and will forever be one of my favorite periods in all of human history.

[(24:52)](#!):

As for something I was disappointed in, honestly nothing big jumps out at me, but the closest thing I can think of is that the trial of Thomas Wentworth, the Earl of Strafford, wound up being some pretty extraordinarily weak sauce. I knew that his trial and execution was central to the beginning of the English civil wars, but once I got done studying it in detail, I was like, I mean, that’s it? That’s all you have? All you’ve got on him is one lame quote deliberately taken out of context and misrepresented? The case against Strafford was pathetic. I am so glad that bills of attainder are just not a thing anymore.

Fred Keys asks, Listening to the podcast has reminded me that I learned and remember very little about European history between the end of the Napoleonic period and the outbreak of World War I. Do you have any suggestions as to good books, audiobooks preferred, that will cover what you will not? It has been a long time since I have been able to do any reading on that period, what with the history of Rome consuming my brain for five years and now revolutions doing the same thing. I don’t really have time to read off-topic. But whatever you read, you should get yourself a good understanding of the Franco-Prussian War. The Franco-Prussian War is really, really important.

[(26:10)](#!):

Nick Bastow asks, Looking back over Rome plus the English, American, and French Revolutions, what are your top three what-on-earth-were-they-thinking moments? I.e. your top three, because duh King Charles, moments. Okay so setting aside Charles, the first would have to be the assassination of Aurelian. That was the dumbest assassination in Roman history. I’m actually like still a little angry about it. I’m getting angry now just thinking about it. Second has to be Gentleman Johnny’s Party Train. The Greeks have been trying to teach us all about hubris for 2,000 years and nobody ever seems to get it.

[(26:50)](#!):

Third, I’ll say the entire buildup to the war between Austria and France in 1792. That was just a running contest to see who could out-blunder who. Both sides thought the other was on the verge of collapse and could just be pushed over with a feather. Nobody understood what the hell was really going on, except maybe Robespierre, and so everyone rushed into a war that was supposed to last a few weeks and wound up engulfing Europe for 20 years. Oh, also, it probably destroyed whatever chance the French Revolution had of resolving itself peacefully. When people tell you that a war is going to be quick and easy and cheap and fun for the whole family, don’t listen to them.

Kevin Barrett asks, how do you go about researching a topic? Do you have go-to books or websites that recommend sources? Do you ask friends and experts? I tend to have trouble knowing where to start digging on particularly complex subjects, something that you seem adept at.

[(27:50)](#!):

When I started building up the reading list for revolutions, the approach that I took was to Google the topic followed by the word historiography. So English Revolution historiography, American Revolution historiography, and so forth. That should take you to articles that will address not just the topic itself, but also the history of how the topic has been studied, and contained therein will be references to every important book that has ever been written on the topic, how they adjusted previous interpretations, and what their influence was on future scholarship.

[(28:24)](#!):

Once you’ve read a few of those, you’ll probably have a little list of books that are clearly must-reads if you’re going to consider yourself well-versed in the subject. So for the English Revolution, that meant that I had to read The History of the Great Civil War by S.R. Gardner, The World Turned Upside Down by Christopher Hill, Fall of the British Monarchies by Conrad Russell. Once you’ve read the seminal influential works, you’re going to have a pretty good foundation of knowledge and a variety of ways to think about the subject. After that, you’re free to investigate whatever details and subtopics that you find particularly interesting, and hopefully, you’ll then get to enjoy both the forest and the trees.

Mark Fullerton asks, The English and American Revolutions remained fairly, only fairly, without the same level of internal bloodletting as the French. On the other hand, both of those became fairly major civil wars, whereas the French had smaller breakouts e.g. the Vaudet.

[(29:23)](#!):

Why? That is a really good question, and at the moment, I don’t think I have a really good answer. The first thing I ever read back in college that was concerned with a general theory on revolutions as opposed to just one particular revolution was Hannah Arendt’s On Revolution. One of her big points concerning the different levels of violence in the American and French revolutions was that the American colonies had a very large middle class and basically no poor urban masses. Even in the quote-unquote big cities like Boston and Philadelphia, there were poor laborers, but unemployment and complete scarcity of goods and abject poverty were just not really a thing. So without that desperate pressure pushing up from below, things didn’t get so bloody.

[(30:08)](#!):

And certainly, most of the extreme violence that we’ve seen so far\xe2\x80\x94the lynching surrounding the fall of the Bastille, the massacre of the Swiss guards, the September massacres\xe2\x80\x94well, those have all been perpetrated by, or driven by, the lower classes in Paris. Now, I’m not sure that that’s right, though, and this is going to require more research to get to the bottom of. When I’m done with the show, there’s obviously going to be a huge compare-and-contrast session of all the revolutions that I’ve covered, and the question of the different levels of violence and terror will have to be thoroughly investigated.

[(30:43)](#!):

Dirk Hoffman-Beching, on behalf of Emma Hoffman-Beching, age 11, asks, At what age did you get excited about history, and what history was the first that you focused on? I think I have always been excited about history. I’ve always enjoyed it. But when I really got turned on to it was probably Mrs. Farrell’s fifth-grade class. That was the year that American history was a big focus, and her approach was to say, OK, put your pencils down and just listen. I am going to tell you stories. And then she would tell us stories. And it’s hard to not look at what I’m doing right now and not see me doing just that\xe2\x80\x94telling stories.

[(31:22)](#!):

My first great history love, though, was the American Revolution. And it would not be out of line to say that I started revolutions in part because I wanted to go back and hang out with my old friends again. Paul Hart asks, What do you think happened to the disappeared 9th Legion? I do not have the foggiest idea what happened to the disappeared 9th Legion, and I don’t think anyone else does either. When I’m done with the time machine, then I’m going to get a few questions, hence I’ll let you borrow it. You can go back and check it out, and please report back. Robert Williams asks, Would you consider the Glorious Revolution in England a revolution?

[(32:02)](#!):

Absolutely I would. But I do think it’s interesting that these days the Glorious Revolution is considered the true English Revolution, while what I call the English Revolution is merely the English Civil Wars. Even though the Glorious Revolution more or less resembles every dynastic royal struggle in history. Yes, it inaugurated true constitutional monarchy, but it played out as one branch of the family fighting the other branch of the family for control of the throne. Meanwhile, the entire struggle between Parliament and the king, which resulted in the king getting his head cut off, and monarchy being abolished, and England being a republic for ten years, it’s like, no, that wasn’t really a revolution, that was just a civil war.

[(32:45)](#!):

Charles Lovett asks, Who are the five greatest generals in human history and why? So, this might come as a bit of a surprise, but I don’t really have a good answer. My primary interest is political history. I study wars and battles because eventually that’s where political leaders go to settle things. These wars and battles wind up being important hinge points in the development of kingdoms and states and empires. But military history per se isn’t anything I’ve really studied broadly enough to be able to accurately compare Rommel to Tokugawa to Crazy Horse. That said, I can definitely weigh in on the best generals from the periods that I have personally studied.

[(33:27)](#!):

So for Rome, obviously Hannibal and Scipio emerged from the Second Punic War as all-time great strategists and tacticians. Hannibal’s first few years in Italy, Scipio’s Spanish campaigns are both works of art. I also just spent some time revisiting the period between the Gracchae and the dictatorship of Sulla, and was reminded how brilliant Marius was. I think his reputation gets dragged down because he went off the reservation there at the end, but he single-handedly reformed the entire Roman army, and then went up to Gaul and smashed the biggest external threat to Rome since the Carthaginians. He was absolutely one of the greatest military minds in Roman history.

[(34:08)](#!):

Julius Caesar is of course one of the greatest generals in all of history. I would put Aurelian on that list because of everything he was able to do in just five years, and then Aetius was clearly the best general of those last few generations of Romans. In the English Revolution, things obviously start going really well for the parliamentary cause once Sir Thomas Fairfax gets into the game.

[(34:31)](#!):

Thomas Fairfax deserves a lot better than he gets in terms of his historical standing. Cromwell was obviously no slouch, and then John Lambert was, like, unbeatable. The royalists didn’t really have anyone of that caliber. Maybe Sir George Goring if he hadn’t been so drunk all the time. Prince Rupert certainly had a lot of promise, and people liked to talk him up, but he kept not coming back.

[(34:56)](#!):

The American War of Independence is pretty famous for its major lack of truly great generalship. I wonder a lot about what Richard Montgomery could have done had he not been killed in the Battle of Quebec in 1775, and then, aside from hypothetical Richard Montgomery, Daniel Morgan was almost certainly the best pure military man in the Continental Army. On the British side, Cornwallis was for sure the most capable of the senior generals, but that really isn’t saying much. As for the French Revolution, well, that kid Bonaparte sure is about to make a name for himself. Larry Betts asks, are revolutions that revolutionary? They are fun and informative to study, all in their own unique way, but they all seem to involve 15 to 20 years of pain and violence and end with everyone agreeing that the new guy’s mustache is way nicer than the old guy’s. Then they get on with paying taxes and trying to find enough to eat in the ruins. I suppose I am suggesting that small-step evolutions tend to get overlooked because they are not very exciting, but they lead to way more change than the thrilling, noisy flag-waving, beheading types of revolution that we all love to read about.

[(36:06)](#!):

I think it’s broadly true that revolutions tend to overhaul society a little bit less than we might suppose, that it’s more like a big wave that crashes up on the beach but then recedes, and it turns out that the tide has really only come in a few inches. It would be nice if everyone could just agree to move those few inches without inflicting those years of pain and violence on each other, but sometimes those with power just get too rigid and inflexible, so instead of accepting gradual reform, things snap. Some conflicts, unfortunately, can only be settled in blood.

[(36:43)](#!):

As I mentioned earlier, there will eventually be a big compare-and-contrast session for all the revolutions, and clearly one of the big issues at stake in all the early modern revolutions was can the sovereign expropriate property from citizens without their consent? After the wave crashed and receded in each of the revolutions, the answer that remained was a resounding no. Even with both the English and French revolutions resulting ultimately in restorations, the monarchies that were quote-unquote restored were very different from the monarchies that had been pulled down. It was about way more than just the quality of their mustaches \xe2\x80\x94 there were limits placed on those kings that their predecessors did not have to deal with, and the horrible experience of revolution, with all its noisy beheadings, was a big reason they were forced to accept those shackles.

[(37:35)](#!):

Chris Burke asks, how important do you think the control of the issuance of passports by the revolutionaries was to the French Revolution?

[(37:44)](#!):

The irony of the passport controls was that one of those enlightened civil rights that was so much a part of the early revolution was the freedom of movement, both within the realm itself and coming and going from it. Telling a man where he can and cannot go was a mark of despotism, and not worthy of a free people. But this was tossed aside, as fear and paranoia swept through the country as it was faced with the dual threat of foreign agents crossing into France, and then enemies within France making good their escape. So in that sense, it’s just another example of the revolution tossing aside its principles in the name of expedience, because no man can reign innocently.

[(38:27)](#!):

The other thing that it did was create an abstract national identity that was somehow detached from place of birth, or language, or ethnicity. Your ability to secure a passport now rested on your ability to prove that you adhered to the most current patriotic dogma, and failure to do so meant that you weren’t just a royalist, but that you weren’t even a true Frenchman anymore, and you were therefore ineligible for a passport. And without the passport, you were trapped, now essentially a foreign alien inside your own country.

[(38:59)](#!):

In that sense, I think the control of passports helped determine who was safe and who was fair game when the heads started to roll, because killing an enemy alien is a lot easier than killing your fellow countrymen. Mark Heilman asks, OK, so Lafayette. It’s fascinating how differently he’s viewed in the US and France. How do you see him as a historical figure?

[(39:24)](#!):

Lafayette is indeed an interesting case. For a long time, I only knew him from the American Revolution, as this young pup eager to please, he refuses to take a salary, he says, I’m here to learn, not teach. He was legitimately brave in battle, and did a pretty good job when he finally got an independent command. So from the American perspective, the Marquis de Lafayette is nothing but a heroic young man who we adore. The French, meanwhile, see him as this vainglorious buffoon who lived in a fantasy world where he was the star of the show, and when reality hit him full in the face, that he wasn’t, he had to slink off the stage in disgrace.

[(40:04)](#!):

Now I think the potshots leveled at Lafayette by the French are unfair, but not necessarily wrong. He did live in a fantasy world of his own making, and it’s not hard to argue that all of his exaggerated deference to Washington was just Lafayette playing out this story arc that called for him to start as the student so in time he could return home and become the master. But at the end of the day, I think it’s pretty clear that Lafayette did have noble intentions. It wasn’t just about his own ego. I mean, he wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man, for God’s sakes. So the bottom line is, I like Lafayette. I think he was pointed in the right direction, and if I saw him on the street, I would shake his hand. Ingrid Helsing-Almas \xe2\x80\x94 hopefully I’m pronouncing that right \xe2\x80\x94 asks, I would like to know more about the shape of your week. How much do you read up during the week? How much do you know already? And is every episode scripted, or do you ad lib? And the world is big, and there are a lot of books. How do you select your sources?

[(41:07)](#!):

So as I mentioned, I script everything. And for revolutions, I’ve taken a historiographic approach to my book selection. As for the particulars of my week, I work between 830am and 2.30pm every day. That is when the boy is off at daycare. Monday and Tuesday are usually consumed with compiling a super-detailed outline of what I want to cover and what order I want to cover it. Wednesday and Thursday is usually writing and editing. Episodes are now getting up around 4,500 words. Friday is more editing, particularly my world-famous speed edit, where I read the transcript out loud as fast as humanly possible to pick up any hidden tongue twisters or awkward sentence transitions. Then I record. That takes about an hour. Then I have to listen to the recorded episode to make sure there’s nothing wrong with the audio, which I have to say is the worst part of the whole thing. I mean, I just spent days writing it and rewriting it and then recording it and now I have to listen to it all over again. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it torture, but I’m pretty much ready to be done with the episode by now.

[(42:12)](#!):

Then I post the episode, I have a drink, and start worrying about next week’s show. James Ruff asks, My interest was piqued during a recent episode where you mentioned Thomas Paine’s election as an honorary delegate of France’s national convention. What were the positions, actions of the other paragons of the American Revolution towards the revolution in France, and how did these views change over the tumultuous course of the revolution?

[(42:40)](#!):

The French Revolution was a major sticking point early on in American politics. The Federalists surrounding Alexander Hamilton were pretty pro-British and anti-French, while the Democratic-Republicans surrounding Thomas Jefferson were pretty pro-French and anti-British. Jefferson in particular was very enthusiastic about the French Revolution and was eager to help it succeed. Your attitude about the French Revolution was, for a few years there, a pretty good litmus test about which side of the political fence you were on.

[(43:10)](#!):

George Washington, of course, wanted to keep America away from any European entanglements, and pointedly declared neutrality when everyone in Europe started declaring war on everyone else in early 1793. The popularity of the French Revolution went into steep decline once reports of the Reign of Terror started crossing the Atlantic, and by 1798, the U.S. was in an undeclared war with France. John Loughran asks, When we look back in a hundred years’ time, which of the most recent and the current conflicts in the world do you think will prove to have been the most significant revolution?

[(43:49)](#!):

Assuming that we’re now somehow so far removed from the collapse of communism that it no longer counts as recent, obviously the Arab Spring is the answer. It will always be a part of explaining the history of the early 21st century, though what it winds up meaning is still up to us. Stephen Mawson asks, If you could interview one individual from each of the revolutions you’ve covered so far, who would you interview, and what question would you ask them?

[(44:19)](#!):

Since I started working on revolutions, I have become very interested in the men who were overtaken by events. The guys who started out on the leading edge of the revolution, and then found themselves solidly in the political middle, then denounced as reactionary conservatives, and then maybe run out of town.

[(44:37)](#!):

So my candidates for the panel discussion on this topic would be from the English Revolution, the Earl of Essex, who was an uncompromising opponent of King Charles in the early days of the long parliament, then he led the parliamentary armies, then he wound up being dubbed insufficiently committed to the cause and shown the door. The self-denying ordinance could very easily be called the Dump Essex Ordinance. From the American Revolution, I would invite John Dickinson, whose letters from a Pennsylvania farmer put him way out in front, but he is generally remembered today for his opposition to independence in the Second Continental Congress.

[(45:17)](#!):

From the French Revolution, of all the guys who get overrun, I think Antoine Barnaud is probably the most emblematic, the most radical voice down in Dauphin\xc3\xa9 during the Day of the Tiles, then a key leader in the National Assembly, a founding member of the Jacobins, and then suddenly he’s a reactionary apologist for aristocratic swine, and is soon enough going to get his head chopped off for being a counter-revolutionary. The question to all of them would be the same. So what was it like to go from radical to moderate to conservative, all without really ever changing your opinion about anything?

[(45:55)](#!):

Katrina Setterholen asks, what is your favorite fiction and non-fiction book to date? I thought a lot about this, because obviously picking one of each is borderline impossible. But for non-fiction, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72 by Hunter S. Thompson just cannot be beat. Anyone who has any interest in American politics must read it. As for fiction, I would be lying through my teeth if I said anything but Illuminatus by Robert Shay and Robert Anton Wilson. Anyone who has any interest in what’s really going on must read that, too.

[(46:35)](#!):

Hail Eris. Niels Christiansen asks, among all the historical figures you’ve covered, who would you have most liked to have been, and why? Of all the Romans, it’s kind of tough to not want to have been Antoninus Pius. That guy had a sweet life.

[(46:53)](#!):

But really, I think my answer to this question is John Lambert. I love John Lambert. He was a great soldier, a great general, a great leader, a deep thinker. I mean, we’re talking about a guy who basically won every battle he ever fought and composed the first written constitution in English history. He’s basically George Washington and James Madison combined. Now the whole dying insane after 23 years of solitary imprisonment isn’t ideal, but Lambert is the man. Jan Willem van Dalen asks, I was wondering if you ever considered discussing the Dutch Revolution against Spain in the 16th century in your podcast.

[(47:33)](#!):

Yes, I did. I really did consider starting the whole series with the Dutch Revolt. I am really super interested in Dutch history, as you’ll see in a second. But the process of Dutch independence unfolds over like 80 years, and that seemed just too unwieldy to kick the show off with. Of course, then I started with the unfailingly convoluted English Revolution, so you know, what the hell do I know about anything? George Pratt asks, if you count the establishment of the Republic as a revolution, then why is there a 2,000-year gap between European revolutions where a monarchy is replaced with a representative form of government?

[(48:13)](#!):

Well, to start with, I think you can knock the first thousand years of that off, because it took that long for the whole history of the Empire to play out. After that, early feudalism entrenches itself, and the ties that started binding everyone together more or less demanded a monarch at the center of all circles. So I think that gets you to at least the high Middle Ages without there really even being an opportunity for a monarchy to be replaced by a representative government.

[(48:39)](#!):

The little city-state republics that cropped up along the way \xe2\x80\x94 and here I’m thinking about Venice, which I think got going in like the 700s \xe2\x80\x94 well, those were more or less born that way, rather than involving the overthrow of a king. There were also lots of free imperial cities out there in the Holy Roman Empire that functioned as republics, but they were all technically subordinate to the emperor, so we can’t really count them. But once the high Middle Ages kicks in, you do start to see more Italian city-states \xe2\x80\x94 like Genoa and Florence and so on \xe2\x80\x94 kicking out whatever noble lord happened to hold sway and then reform themselves as republics. The Republic of Florence, for example, was founded in the year 1115.

[(49:18)](#!):

So it’s really only about 1,500 years after the expulsion of the Tarquins that you start seeing monarchies \xe2\x80\x94 or some version of monarchy \xe2\x80\x94 being replaced by a representative government, rather than the full 2,000 years. And then when you go back and think about it, really until the Americans come along, Western history has basically never seen a king who reigned over a large territory replaced by a representative government. Even in the Roman case, the King of Rome was really just the glorified mayor of a city-state when he was toppled. No one had ever tried to take a huge swath of territory and convert it into a republic until the American colonies took a stab at it. The concern that it would never work was actually something James Madison had to explicitly address in Federalist No. 10.

[(50:07)](#!):

Once the Americans showed that it could actually work, that’s, I think, when you get the Europeans back in the old country, thinking that maybe they could get away with ditching their kings too. Rachel Lynn Underwood asks, You’ve mentioned in the history of Rome that you believe Livia’s reputation as an evil conniving poisoner was probably informed more by existing Roman archetypes \xe2\x80\x94 the evil stepmother who murders everyone \xe2\x80\x94 than by historical fact. Is there a similar case where archetype trumps accuracy in the revolutions you’ve been reading about? What historical figure does the popular narrative most misinterpret in your opinion?

[(50:46)](#!):

In my opinion, I think the British have got Oliver Cromwell all wrong. In my \xe2\x80\x94 albeit limited \xe2\x80\x94 exposure to the general British popular image of the man, it seems like he is portrayed as a literally puritanical military dictator, mostly to be deployed as the butt of jokes and then dismissed. But having gone through his career in fairly fine detail, I just don’t see that stereotype holding up.

[(51:13)](#!):

I mean, Cromwell himself was a devout puritan, yes, and he did believe God was literally on his side. But he was also convinced that religious toleration was essential, and he was one of the first to really articulate that point and then try to put it into practice when he held power. His alliance with the ultra-activist Puritans in London \xe2\x80\x94 those were the guys who were literally waging a war on Christmas \xe2\x80\x94 that was a forced political marriage. Cromwell himself tolerated their program out of necessity.

[(51:45)](#!):

And then his actions during the entire run of political experimentation after the execution of Charles points to a guy who was desperately trying to share power, not gobble it all up for himself. As I said, one of the things the French accuse each other of a lot is trying to be Cromwell. But the funny thing is that I don’t think that Cromwell himself was ever trying to be Cromwell. It was just something he was kind of forced into.

[(52:12)](#!):

Benjamin Davidson asks, why didn’t Parliament settle the whole direct-versus-indirect taxation-slash-parliament-right-to-tax-the-colonies issue by notifying the American colonies of the amount of goods or sums they hoped to procure via taxation and then allow the colonial representative bodies the difficult \xe2\x80\x94 and likely alienating \xe2\x80\x94 task of working out the nitty-gritty details of what foreign taxes should take and upon whom they would be imposed? It seems like Parliament and the ministry got themselves into a staring contest when they ought to have been sowing discord in the colonial ranks. In your opinion, would this policy have done anything to prevent the breakout of the revolution?

[(52:54)](#!):

So my basic understanding of this question is that Parliament just could not handle a scenario where Parliament was not the one creating taxes. So saying to the Virginia House of Burgesses, we need X amount of money from you per year, go create the taxes that meet that requirement, that would have been an unthinkable breach of parliamentary sovereignty over the right to tax.

[(53:16)](#!):

Were they dug in too deep on that point? Yes, I think they were. I think they took Parliament’s right to tax far too literally. The point was that taxes had to come from a body that represented the taxed, and the Americans were not represented in Parliament. It wasn’t that literally Parliament was the only body that should be able to issue a tax. And I have always thought that letting the colonies tax themselves would have completely defused the crisis.

That said, I just read the most fascinating thing about the financial history of the Dutch Republic \xe2\x80\x94 something that I never knew before. In the Netherlands were Spanish possessions, the Spanish crown did exactly as you suggest \xe2\x80\x94 they demanded subsidies from the various Dutch provinces and left it to the Dutch themselves to raise and collect the money as they saw fit. What happened is that Holland started raising taxes pretty efficiently, and then they were able to start floating bonds based off of that tax revenue.

[(54:13)](#!):

Pretty soon people in Europe with money to invest noticed that Holland was really super dependable about paying back its debts, and before too long the Dutch had better credit than the Spanish Habsburgs who were by that point totally overextended. So when the United Provinces decided to revolt, they were able to finance the uprising pretty easily, specifically because they had once upon a time been granted control over the levying and collection of taxes. Now I don’t think that the Dutch and American cases are exactly equal, but it is interesting to note that one of the great roads not taken by Parliament as they dealt with the colonies was taken by the Spanish, and it resulted in a successful revolt anyway.

Janet Oblinger asks, if time travel were possible, which era, country, or event would you like to go to?

[(55:07)](#!):

So I’m now thinking that what I would do is zoom way back before civilization ever took root. There are a couple of firsts that I would really like to witness when it comes to the dawn of humanity. I’d like to watch the first human make a fire. There was some specific person in some specific place at some specific time that had to have been the very first one to do it. I’d like to watch it happen. Or see the first time one person used a written symbol to convey an idea to another person. Or then, you know, more cynically, it’d be really fun to witness the first lie that was ever told, since lying is such a fundamental part of human social interaction, you know. Does this bearskin make me look fat? Um\xe2\x80\xa6 no?

Dylan asks, let’s say I was the kind of person who likes to dive into an area of history and devour anything and everything I could find about it. What is an often overlooked yet incredibly interesting historical subject, person, place, thing, or time that I could sink my teeth into and find lots of good sources about? Since I was just thinking about the 19th century and the Franco-Prussian War, I think I will point you to everything that goes on between about 1870 and 1896.

[(56:26)](#!):

That period deserves serious attention these days. This is an era that is simultaneously known as the Second Industrial Revolution, the Long Depression, and the Gilded Age. There are huge parts of the modern world that are born in those years, and lots of lessons to be learned about what is going on right now. There is also more than enough information about all of it to drown in, if you so choose. Deborah Wilson asks, what is your favorite outdoor sculpture on the Western Washington University campus and why?

[(56:60)](#!):

For those of you who don’t know, I did my undergrad at Western Washington University in Bellingham, and Deborah is a fellow alumnus. The campus is fantastic. There is lots of really cool landscape design and outdoor sculptures. It’s actually a little bit famous for it. Unfortunately, I’ve always been a little cynical when it comes to art, so my favorite pieces are both located on the South Campus.

[(57:23)](#!):

The bed of rocks that is supposed to have steam rising out of it that then changes and swirls in different light and weather, but which I never once ever saw turned on the entire time I was there, and there were years where I literally walked past it every single day. And then, of course, the stairs to nowhere. What the hell is going on with the stairs to nowhere? Robert Mass asks, what were the biggest factors which led you to do a podcast series on political revolutions? As I mentioned earlier, the American Revolution was probably my first great historical love. But my second great historical love was the Russian Revolution. I was obsessed with the Russian Revolution when I was a teenager. So like I said, this is a lot about going back to hang out with old friends.

[(58:09)](#!):

The weird thing, though, is that when I look back on it, I can’t quite figure out why I was so obsessed with the Russian Revolution. By the time I was really delving into it in the mid-1990s, I mean, the Soviet Union had already collapsed, so it wasn’t about trying to understand our Cold War enemy. And I may as well say out loud that no matter how hard I tried, I never could get down with Marxism and communism, even when I was young and dumb. So it wasn’t exactly about cheering those guys on. I guess I’ve just always been drawn to revolutions. Can’t really explain why. I can tell you, though, that the immediate impetus for the show, like when I actually formulated the idea, was when I wrote a paper comparing the progress of Cesar Chavez’s farmworkers movement to the stages of revolution outlined by Crane Brinton in his Anatomy of Revolution. And that’s when all my old love for the American and Russian Revolutions came flooding back, and I was like, oh, man, I know what podcast I’m going to do next.

[(59:08)](#!):

Matt Crawford asks, I was wondering if you ever considered doing an episode on Paul Revere. I know you’re past the American Revolution, but you must admit he is quite the character and is more than deserving of your personal touch for his own episode. So what, that Legend Has It episode wasn’t good enough for you? Did you not see it? I’m re-embedding it right now on the top of revolutionspodcast.com. If you haven’t watched it, go watch it. It’s funny and often makes sense.

Robert Phillips asks, I was surprised to find out that nobody knows exactly where Charlemagne is buried. Which makes me wonder if we know where any important ancient person is buried, excluding the dudes in the pyramids. So framing the question more narrowly, do we know the precise burial locations of any historically significant Romans who lived during the imperial era? I’d like to visit Aetius’s tomb.

[(01:00:01)](#!):

Well, I don’t know about Aetius, but we actually do know where a lot of the emperors were buried. As you know, they were all cremated rather than buried, so we’re going to be talking about where their remains wound up. Shortly after winning the empire, Augustus constructed what is now called the Mausoleum of Augustus, and that’s where all the major Julio-Claudians went, including Tiberius and Drusus and Germanicus, Claudius, all-time great best friend Marcus Agrippa. And what’s super exciting is that despite its obvious importance, the Mausoleum of Augustus has sat totally neglected behind a fence in Rome for decades. But just last year, the Italians announced that they are going to rehabilitate it and open it back up to the public. That is really exciting stuff.

[(01:00:46)](#!):

So after the Julio-Claudians, Domitian built a temple to the Flavians on the Quirinal Hill, where Vespasian and Titus were deposited. But archaeologists today only have an educated guess where it was, over now by the Church of Santa Susanna, northeast of Termini Station. Trajan, of course, went into Trajan’s Column, that’s one of the reasons it was built. Hadrian went into the Mausoleum of Hadrian, which he built, and is now known as the Castle de San Angelo. And that became the new imperial resting place, and Hadrian was eventually joined by Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, possibly Commodus, though I’m not sure about that. Caracalla was the last emperor to be buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian. That skipped Septimius Severus, of course, because he died in York and was buried up there, though no one knows where, and I actually did spend a little bit of time looking into it because I was just up in York and will be there again next month. The rest of the 3rd century is too damn confusing to try to go through, but for the record, no, nobody knows where Aurelian wound up. Diocletian was buried in what is today the Cathedral of St. Domnius in Croatia. Constantine then built the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, and that became the imperial resting place for most of the eastern emperors for centuries. And from the History of Rome era, that includes Julian the Apostate, Jovian, Valentinian, Theodosius. Unfortunately, most of the sarcophagi were broken into by the Crusaders, and the old church was eventually replaced by a mosque, so there’s nothing really to see there. So that’s a pretty good list, I think, and it only took a minimal amount of googling to cobble together.

[(01:02:26)](#!):

Dustin Rusco asks, I will be honest, I imagine you in a toga. I am sure you don’t wear one, at least not all of the time, but I was wondering if there is any part of Roman civilization that you have incorporated into your life. Perhaps you have a herma in your garden. How about Saturnalia? Have you incorporated any customs from that into your yuletide? Or are you just fomenting revolutions in your free time?

[(01:02:50)](#!):

To be honest, I cannot really think of a single Roman practice or custom that I’ve actually incorporated into my life. Although as a very light morning-eater, I was happy to discover that the Romans ate very little in the morning before heading out the door. I am baffled by their ability to eat lying down, which has always been weird and awkward for me. In broader terms, though, I have always admired the Roman willingness to assimilate good ideas wherever they found them, and I’ve always tried to live with that principle in mind. I despise it when people reject good ideas because they didn’t think of it first or the idea just comes from somebody they don’t really like. That’s silly. People shouldn’t do that.

[(01:03:30)](#!):

As for fomenting revolutions, unfortunately I now know way too much about how things really wind up going to be eager to ever let the genie out of the bottle ever again. From about-to-be three-time tour alumnus Andrea Smith, she asks, do you see a history of Rome, the Gallic campaigns, or something like that in the future?

[(01:03:52)](#!):

Yeah, we have always kicked around the idea of a Julius Caesar-themed tour. I should talk to Nate about it. While I’m at it, if anyone out there listening missed the Rome tours and would like us to run another one, send me an email at revolutionspodcastatgmail.com. I’d like to gauge interest because I’d love to do another one. I mean, they’re opening the mausoleum of Augustus back up, and I want to see it. Steven Britton asks, now that it has been a few years since the end of the history of Rome, looking back, what was your favorite part about producing that series, and how does it feel to have completed the entire history of the Western Empire in podcast form?

[(01:04:32)](#!):

When I was young, I had a lot of dreams and a lot of ambition, and that was great. But as I got older, and the years ticked by, and I kept not doing anything, or more precisely starting a lot of different things and having them all go nowhere, I started to be haunted by a voice. A voice that usually came at night, you know, when the demons come. And that voice said, you’re supposed to be on your third great American novel by now, and look at you. You’ve done absolutely nothing with your life, and you probably never will.

[(01:05:01)](#!):

Completing the history of Rome means that whenever that voice tries to pop back up, I can tell it to shut up. Whatever else it was, the history of Rome was something, so you can’t say I’ve done nothing, and then the voice has to go away, and I get to go to sleep. Jem Edsel asks, do you or have you played video games, and do you view them as an educational tool? I ask because my first exposure to history and ancient cultures was from the Civilization series of culture and empire building games, which led to my love of both, and eventually your work.

[(01:05:37)](#!):

Okay, so I do not personally really play video games. I like Missile Command, I like Ms. Pac-Man, and that’s about it. That said, I think video games can be a great educational tool. I have a ton of friends who do play them. They play Ages of Empire, they play Total War, they play the Assassin’s Creed games, which I now hear a lot about because I’ve been running parallel to them for the last few years. The last one was set during the American Revolution, and I think the most recent one is set during the French Revolution. When I hear friends who have no interest in history come over and suddenly want to talk to me about Charles Lee and whether he was actually that big of a villain in real life, well that’s all good in my book. So by all means, everyone, please play on.

[(01:06:22)](#!):

John Donnellan said that he would be happy to sponsor somebody else’s question, and so I decided to take a fun one from Roger, which was just posted in the comments section of last week’s show. You’ve mentioned that Talleyrand is one of your favorite historical figures. In that same vein, who is your most hated figure? While confining this again to the periods I’ve really studied in depth, my least favorite Roman of all time is whichever Appiest Claudius happens to be around. Those guys are terrible.

[(01:06:54)](#!):

From the English Revolution, I really got sick of Arthur Haselrig’s crap at the end. That guy did everything in his power to keep the Protectorate from working, and very much succeeded in keeping the Protectorate from working, because he had deluded himself into thinking that a purged parliament elected by almost no one was somehow the true representative of the people and therefore deserved unlimited power over everything. Get a grip, Haselrig.

[(01:07:22)](#!):

For the American Revolution, Horatio Gates turned out to have been quite a bigger horse’s ass than I remember. His conduct down in South Carolina was just unforgivably dumb. And then so far in the French Revolution, I’m having a really hard time not wanting to pin the blame for everything on Jacques-Pierre Brissot. Beat the drums for war, and then when things go bad, start making paranoid accusations to avoid responsibility. Brissot basically built the stage the Terror is going to play out on. So good work on being an early and vocal opponent of slavery, but the French I think would have been a lot better off if he had just stayed in London.

[(01:08:03)](#!):

Christopher Kuntz asks, the English Civil Wars was like they fought over a bunch of stuff then killed the king, then Oliver Cromwell, later the monarchy was restored. The French Revolution is like they fought over a bunch of stuff, they killed the king, then Napoleon for a while, later the monarchy was restored. So my question is, what happened to all of the kings? Were the various constitutional monarchies retooled at some point so that the royals became irrelevant? At what point did all of these countries get modern governments? Do any others still have figurehead royal families? Do they have any function in government?

[(01:08:37)](#!):

The answer to this question is extraordinarily complicated. But in part, the answer is that the history of Europe over the last 200 years or so is the history of taking monarchies and putting them into little tiny gilded boxes, and then either keeping those boxes up on a shelf because they are beloved family heirlooms, or chucking them out the window because who needs them?

[(01:08:59)](#!):

Of the 30 countries in the EU, 12 of them remain monarchies, including Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain. The rest are straight-up republics, who all shed their king at some point along the line. France had their last king in 1848, Italy’s last king abdicated in 1946. Every country’s history is different, though World War I did turn out to be quite the kingslayer. These days, whether technically a monarchy or technically a republic, parliamentary democracy is the thing everywhere. And I genuinely wonder, though, how long that will last.

[(01:09:39)](#!):

Our final question today comes from another History of Rome Tour alumnus, Mike Manfred, who clearly has no idea how to read a calendar or follow instructions, but I like him so I’ll let the lateness of his questions slide. How do you think history would have changed or shaped itself had Cicero decided to be a part of the triumvirate, or I guess quadravorate?

[(01:10:04)](#!):

The first thing you have to ask is where does this hypothetical Cicero fit into the equation? Caesar was gunning to be the first man in Rome, obviously. Crassus is looking to eventually win that big military victory that will legitimize him politically. Pompey just wants his eastern settlements ratified and his fetters given land that they have been promised. But what would Cicero have wanted? What did he want? I’m not really sure he ever had a specific agenda, and that’s probably one of the reasons he didn’t think it was a good idea to join up.

[(01:10:37)](#!):

But let’s say that he did. What does Cicero bring to the table? Well, Crassus brings money, Pompey is Pompey the Great, and Caesar was the rising star of Roman politics.

[(01:10:49)](#!):

So what Cicero probably brings, though, is quite a bit of moral cover for the project, and he did have quite a silver tongue so he becomes the official propagandist of the alliance. So I reckon if Cicero joins up, he becomes the point man in Rome, what with Pompey dozing on a sofa these days. But how much can he keep Cato and the rest of Caesar’s enemies from doing exactly what they did? I don’t think Cicero would have been that influential. So if he can’t reconcile Caesar to his enemies, maybe he can reconcile the triumvirs to each other when they start bickering.

[(01:11:26)](#!):

But of course the first time they almost split up, they wound up working things out, so Cicero wouldn’t have been needed. But then when Crassus dies, and Caesar’s daughter-slash-Pompey’s wife Julia die, the next question is can Cicero successfully prevent the final break between Caesar and Pompey? And that, I think, is a distinct possibility. Maybe he can give Pompey enough cover to work things out, be a key voice in Rome not urging Pompey to break with Caesar. But if he can’t do that, does he stay in Rome when the Senate skips town? I can’t really see him siding with Caesar against the Senate. So clearly it comes down to how much can Cicero heal the rift between Pompey and Caesar, and how much would he have actually wanted to? Because even our hypothetical Cicero was conflicted about joining the pact, it’s not like his heart would ever have been 100% into the project. So maybe as Caesar gets more reckless, Cicero re-entrenches with the Senate, tells Pompey to do the same.

[(01:12:27)](#!):

So in the end, my gut says that there’s about a 10-15% chance Cicero keeps Pompey and Caesar aligned, and the Civil War doesn’t break out at that precise moment. In other words, I don’t really think that Cicero would have been that important one way or the other.

[(01:12:44)](#!):

Okay, so that concludes Question Time, and we are going to wrap up by announcing the winners of the two Ansonyas from among those who purchased t-shirts during the fundraiser. The winners were chosen at random, based on the four-digit order number in the fundraiser database. To ensure the integrity of the selection process, I entrusted the picking of the winning numbers to Vice President of Letter and Number Identification, Elliot William Duncan. So Elliot, please take it away. Lucky winner number one had order\xe2\x80\xa6 One, nine, four, seven.

[(01:13:23)](#!):

Order one, nine, four, seven. That would be Calvin Locke of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Elliot, say congratulations to Calvin. Congratulations! Good work. Okay, winner number two had order\xe2\x80\xa6 Seven, six. Order three, zero, seven, six. That would be Scott Fry of Portland, Oregon, USA. Elliot, say congratulations to Scott with exactly the same tone and inflection.

[(01:14:01)](#!):

Good work. Calvin, Scott, you will be getting email shortly about arranging the shipment of your Ansonyas. As for the rest of you, I think this has gone on long enough, and I am quite ready to have to listen to it all through to make sure there are no mistakes in the audio, and then have a drink.

## 3.31- The Man of Blood Part Deux

 [(00:01)](#!):

This week’s episode is brought to you by Casper.

[(00:04)](#!):

Casper is an online retailer offering premium mattresses for a fraction of the price. The mattress industry has for a very long time forced consumers into paying notoriously high markups, with resellers and showrooms all taking their cut along the way. Casper is revolutionizing the system by offering an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. Made in America, the mattresses combine two technologies, latex foam and memory foam, that provide just the right sink and just the right bounce, and come together for better nights and brighter days. And by cutting out all the middlemen, you can get a twin for $500 or a king for just $950. And if you’ve ever gone out mattress shopping, you know those are some pretty outstanding prices.

[(00:51)](#!):

On top of that, this is all risk-free. Try sleeping on a Casper for 100 days, and if for some crazy reason you don’t like it, you can just return it and pay nothing.

[(01:01)](#!):

Our Casper mattress has now become the official napping mattress of the house, and Mrs. Revolutions gives it her full and unqualified napping endorsement, and that is really saying something. So if you want a better mattress, and you want to pay a fair price, go to casper.com slash Revolutions and use the promo code Revolutions. That gets you $50 off any mattress you want. That again, casper.com slash Revolutions with the promo code Revolutions.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. The man of blood, part deux. When we left off last time, the entourage had just successfully expelled the Girondins from the national convention, which capped off a very chaotic spring of 1793. Today we are going to push our way into the very chaotic summer of 1793. Because believe me, the summer is going to bring the revolution and students of the revolution no relief.

[(02:17)](#!):

It is a summer that will see the French armies push back on all fronts. The Vaudet rebels continue to defy attempts to pacify them. The Federalist cities try to raise an army to march on Paris, and the Jacobin revolutionaries in Paris attempting to push back against all of it, and force the rest of France and indeed the rest of Europe to recognize that they were now the pure and righteous embodiment of the revolution and the future.

[(02:43)](#!):

An assertion that was very much not recognized by a young woman from Normandy named Charlotte Corday, who will purchase a kitchen knife from a vendor in the Palais Royale and then go off to show the world who was really the pure and righteous embodiment of the revolution.

[(03:02)](#!):

To start today, we must head back out to the front lines of the war, where the generals who attempted to salvage the situation after the defection of General Dumouriez found themselves threatened not just by the Allied forces arrayed against them, but by a clique of zealous revolutionary representatives sent to keep an eye on them all. As we will see, both of these threats would prove equally deadly.

[(03:28)](#!):

After the scandal of Dumouriez’s treason, the National Convention voted on April 9 to create an additional corps of representatives on mission who would be sent to keep a much closer watch on the senior commanders leading the revolution’s armies. To ensure that those commanders would not be able to duplicate Dumouriez’s treason, these representatives \xe2\x80\x93 like their civil counterparts \xe2\x80\x93 were given blanket jurisdiction over all military matters. Those representatives were now the supreme authority in camp, and involved themselves in every aspect of the war, from arranging logistics, to planning strategy, to deciding when and where to fight.

[(04:10)](#!):

The arrival of these representatives caused nothing but ulcers for the senior generals, who now had to fight a war under the watchful eye of political commissars who equated prudence and caution with treason, and thought defeat in the field a capital crime. The first poor sod thrust into this unenviable position was the man who was tapped to fill Dumouriez’s treasonous boots in the north, the former Marquis de Dom Pierre, now styled of course simply General Dom Pierre.

[(04:43)](#!):

Dom Pierre was one of those liberal nobles who had long been sympathetic to the aims of the revolution. He had started the war as an aide-de-camp to Rochambeau, and then quickly rose through the ranks because, what with half the officer corps deserting, there was plenty of opportunity for rapid advancement in the revolution’s army. Dom Pierre had stood his ground at Valmy, led the crucial right wing at Gemappes, and was then promoted to general for the invasion of Holland. After the defeat at Nervinden and the defection of Dumouriez, it was left to Dom Pierre to hold the line.

[(05:17)](#!):

He managed to regroup with about 30,000 at a fortified camp at Femar, which was a few miles south of the fortress city of Valenciennes, and from there tried to figure out what to do next. Spoiler alert, it’s not really going to be his decision. With the French now almost entirely evacuated from Belgium, the Allied forces prepared for a renewed invasion of France. And now that the British had joined the war and the Prussians had settled things with Russia in Poland, these Allied forces were bigger and stronger and more determined than Brunswick’s army of 1792 had been.

[(05:56)](#!):

But instead of just barreling towards Paris as Brunswick had done, the Allies this time elected to follow a more methodical approach to invading France, and concentrated their efforts first on capturing the string of French fortresses that dotted the Franco-Belgian frontier. The first target was the city of Conde, and on April 8, the Allies opened up a siege.

[(06:20)](#!):

Back in the French camp, General Dampierre would have preferred to take the opportunity presented by the Allied focus on Conde to rest and recuperate his men. But then along came the representatives on mission from Paris, and they of course had other ideas. They helped Dampierre to understand that anything but an aggressive campaign to relieve Conde would be taken as proof that Dampierre was a traitor. Thus encouraged to fight, Dampierre gathered up his men and said, well, I guess we’re going to go try to relieve Conde now.

[(06:54)](#!):

After reluctantly marching north, Dampierre made contact with a coalition army mobilized to block any attempt to relieve Conde on May 8. The two sides, both numbering about 40,000, squared off across a long line centering around the town of Ricemas. When the fighting began, the French did surprisingly well given the circumstances, and no doubt very aware that his every move was being scrutinized by the representatives on mission, Dampierre led the charge at the middle of the Allied line personally.

[(07:26)](#!):

The French nearly succeeded in pushing the Allies into retreat. In the fighting, Dampierre himself took a cannonball through the leg and had to be carried off the field. Their commander mortally wounded, the French attack wilted into a retreat back to the camp at Femar. Dampierre died of his wounds the next day.

[(07:46)](#!):

And though there was apparently some attempt in the convention to posthumously denounce Dampierre as a traitor, for the crime I suppose of getting killed fighting a battle he did not really want to fight, less ungrateful heads prevailed, and Dampierre was instead interred in the Pantheon as a hero and a martyr, though his remains would be later removed, so we can’t go pay our respects when we’re in Paris here in a couple of weeks.

[(08:12)](#!):

The bulk of the French forces reconvened back at Femar under the temporary command of another poor sod, named Francois LaMarche. With the siege of Cond\xc3\xa9 now safe from French relief efforts, the Allies moved on to their next target, the fortress at Valenciennes, and the first move in that operation was to attack the demoralized French soldiers holed up at Femar on May the 23rd.

[(08:38)](#!):

Though the French were badly outnumbered, 27,000 to 53,000, their camp was up on a defensible ridge, and with a little help from some delays and lack of coordination amongst the Allies, the French managed to hold their position despite suffering 3,000 casualties in the fighting. But as night fell, it was clear to LaMarche that the next day he was likely to be surrounded and forced to surrender, so he abandoned the ridge and headed southwest to regroup.

[(09:06)](#!):

For the crime of withdrawing from a dangerously untenable position in the face of far superior numbers, LaMarche was denounced by the representatives on mission, arrested, and sent to Paris to stand trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal. This sort of thing is about to start happening a lot, and it almost certainly would have been Dampierre’s fate had he not had the good sense to get his leg blown off and then die. The clearly cursed command of the Army of the North was next handed to the former comp de Cuestina. Cuestina had once upon a time been a young colonel in Rochambeau’s expeditionary force that had fought in the American War of Independence, and he had earned himself a bunch of medals for his actions at Yorktown.

[(09:50)](#!):

Coming home, he was elected to the Estates General, where he was tightly associated with fellow American veteran and fellow liberal noble Lafayette. After the National Assembly gave way to the Legislative Assembly, Cuestina rejoined the army, and soon found himself leading the Army of the Rhine. And it was under Cuestina’s command that the French army seized all those German principalities on the west side of the Rhine back when everything was going peachy keen in the fall of 1792.

[(10:20)](#!):

The rapid French advance started to be reversed in December when the Prussians retook Frankfurt. Come the spring, the Prussians then redoubled their efforts, and Cuestina was pushed back so fast that he was forced to abandon a French garrison of 20,000 men holding mites, which was now a little island in enemy territory. For the crime of retreating, Cuestina was ordered back to Paris to answer accusations of engaging in demurrier-esque treason. Defending him, though, was none other than Robespierre himself, who successfully convinced the Committee of Public Safety that Cuestina was above reproach.

[(11:00)](#!):

So General Cuestina was given command of the Army of the North on May the 29th, and would soon enough fall prey to its curse, and this time Robespierre would not be able to get him off the hook. But we are going to leave the rolling disasters up on the Belgian frontier for the moment, because things were going no better in the west, where the revolutionaries faced both the uprising in the Vaudee that showed no signs of slowing down, and an invasion across the Pyrenees by the Spanish. Soon to be joined in those threats was the federal’s insurrection of Bordeaux and their call for a Federalist army to be razed and marched on Paris.

[(11:40)](#!):

When last we left the Vaudee, the initial spontaneous uprising of angry peasants had been put under the direction of local nobles who were military veterans of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime army. These nobles then set about turning the rebels into a more coherent army, or should I say more coherent armies, because the form the rebel forces now took were basically that of old feudal armies. You know, where the baron enlists the subjects in his dominion into a sort of private army that then goes off to fight under his personal authority. Well that’s exactly how the rebel armies in the Vaudee will coalesce. Peasants would gather and fight under the banner of their own local lord.

[(12:25)](#!):

Now on the one hand, this was great because the direct client-patron relationship ensured the kind of loyal discipline an army needs to survive, but on the other hand, it hampered the ultimate power of the rebels because those lords often had opposing notions about what to do next, and so they were never able to combine their full strength and pursue a single unified strategy. But in May 1793, the initial strength rather than the ultimate weakness of the rebels was on display.

[(12:58)](#!):

The rebels went back on the offensive against the beleaguered Republican forces who lacked the training, the discipline, and the morale to hold them back. And on May the 5th, 20,000 rebels overwhelmed the 5,000 blues defending the city of Tours.

[(13:13)](#!):

The capture of Tours was a huge boon to the rebel fortunes because the city had a major cache of heavy guns and powder. With these guns in hands, the Vaudee rebels really started to resemble a fully functioning army. Their great strength was obviously the huge and passionate peasant infantry, but they also now boasted an irregular cavalry composed of local horsemen and now obviously batteries of artillery.

[(13:40)](#!):

All of this was put to good use a month later when a 30,000 man army marched on the city of Sommier and seized it from the 12,000 Republicans trying to hold it. After the capture of Sommier, the entire Vaudee region was basically in rebel hands. But then they made a fateful mistake.

[(14:01)](#!):

Instead of coordinating a push to break out of the Vaudee and for example head north to link up with the British who were eager to keep them supplied, the rebels got bogged down laying seeds to the city of Nantes. And this time, the Republican defenders managed to hold out, forcing the rebels to break off on June the 29th. It was the first important victory for the blues since the uprising began, and it cost the rebels a lot of time and a lot of momentum they really didn’t have to spare.

[(14:33)](#!):

As the uprising in the Vaudee was expanding, the convention then got word that down in the southwest the Spanish were opening up a whole new front in the war. In April 1793, the Spanish marched two modest armies up across the border into French territory \xe2\x80\x93 one across the eastern Pyrenees and one up through the western Pyrenees.

[(14:54)](#!):

After taking a string of towns and pushing the very modest French garrisons backward, the Spanish drove the French out of their fortified camp at Maastou on May the 19th, which paved the way for the siege of Belgard, which began on May the 23rd. And when the Spanish successfully captured Belgard a month later, it gave them unrestricted access to one of the major roads through the Pyrenees. Now though the fighting down on the Spanish front was of a much smaller scale than the main centers of action in the Vaudee and then up in the northeast, it still forced the revolutionaries in Paris to accept that they were now fighting a war literally on all fronts, and were currently losing.

[(15:36)](#!):

Back in Paris, this is of course the moment when the enrag\xc3\xa9s go crazy and rise up in armed insurrection.

[(15:42)](#!):

So the delegates in the national convention were now under siege from like every single direction, from the poorest quarters of Paris to the richest courts of Europe, from royalists and Catholics and federalists, radicals, conservatives, moderates. In June 1793, the central revolutionary government in Paris had now been winnowed down to a handful of zealous Jacobins who everyone was gunning for, but who, for some crazy reason, decided that they were not going to give an inch and that instead they were going to fight this thing to the death. And their life and death struggle against everyone everywhere would soon enough give birth to the reign of terror, the Jacobins’ final bloody answer to every question.

[(16:28)](#!):

After the insurrection of May 31, June 2, the first order of business for the Jacobins was neutralizing the rabble-rousing enrag\xc3\xa9s who had just handed them control of the convention.

[(16:40)](#!):

Robespierre and the other delegates of the mountain may have been the beneficiaries of the purge of the Girondins, but they had exactly zero love for the enrag\xc3\xa9s, who the mountain thought little better than rabid anarchists. So on the same day that the Girondins were purged, that is, June 2, 1793, the convention voted to spend every day working on a new constitution for France, one that would be full of red meat for the Saint-Qulot and hopefully undercut the position of the enrag\xc3\xa9 agitators. Now since the inception of the convention back in September 1792, a constitutional committee had been slowly working up a draft.

[(17:18)](#!):

But that committee had been stuffed full of Girondins, and its final draft was delivered just a few weeks after the Girondins had all been painted as royalist appeasers for backing the appeal to the people. And so the tainted committee’s draft was dead on arrival. Over the next few months, other drafts floated around, but with so much else going on, cobbling together the various proposals wasn’t really a priority. After the enrag\xc3\xa9 insurrection, though, the mountain made that constitution its top priority.

[(17:51)](#!):

A five-man committee was appointed to come up with a new draft as quickly as possible, and further signaling the importance of their work, these five guys were appointed to the Committee of Public Safety, which is how young Louis-Antoine de Saint-Just gets on to the committee that will help make him so infamous. But before he became the Angel of Death, which he’s about to become, Saint-Just was simply a charismatic young man who fancied himself a literary genius, and so he took the lead composing the first draft.

[(18:24)](#!):

The articles he cranked out dispensed with all the carefully arranged niceties of the Constitution of 1791. There would be no more separation of powers or checks and balances. Republic of France would be governed by a single, unicameral legislative body that would then elect a 24-man executive committee to handle the administration and execution of the laws. I have also seen it regularly reported that Saint-Just’s draft swept aside the usual two-tiered electoral apparatus, and instead went with a simple one-man, one-vote direct election of delegates, but the final draft clearly lays out a system of primary assemblies feeding into electoral assemblies, so obviously something happened on the way to the printer. Not that it mattered, as we’ll see once the thing gets ratified.

[(19:14)](#!):

The final draft presented to the whole convention on June 10th was also prefaced by a revised and expanded Declaration of the Rights of Man. Where the original version was composed of 17 articles, this new version had 35 articles, and included now was the statement that public relief was a sacred debt and unfortunate citizens must be provided for. It also said that education is needed by all and ought to be available to every citizen, and that if any government should ever break the public trust enshrined in the Declaration of Rights, that an insurrection against that government was quote, the most sacred of rights.

[(19:54)](#!):

With a little luck, the Saint-Culot in the street would read this retroactive sanction of their actions, and feel a little less inclined to exercise that most sacred of rights against the now mountain-led national convention. And indeed, after the new convention was approved by the convention on June 24th and sent out to the provincial primary assemblies for ratification, the Enrag\xc3\xa9 priest Jacques Roux led a deputation into the house demanding cheaper bread and a variety of other radical economic reforms, and he accused the revolution of being worse for the poor than the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime had ever been. When the delegates scoffed him out of the room, though, he was unable for the moment to muster enough outrage in the streets to do anything about it. Not that the Saint-Culot weren’t still ticked off about a whole bunch of different things \xe2\x80\x94 they were, and a series of riots targeting soap retailers over the next few days would attest to that \xe2\x80\x94 it was just that they appeared willing, for the moment, to give the purged convention the benefit of the doubt.

[(20:59)](#!):

And luckily for the delegates in the convention, Paris was about to be rocked by an incident that not only distracted the Saint-Culot, but also gave the Jacobins a bona fide martyr to further cement their hold on the course of the revolution. And I speak now of the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat.

[(21:21)](#!):

As you’ll recall, after the Girondins were put under loose house arrest, a few of them got up and walked out the door one day, including ex-mayor of Paris and former darling of the people, Jerome Petion. This little group surfaced a few days later in Caen up in Normandy, where they started making all kinds of noise about leading the rest of France in revolt against the usurpers in Paris. To this end, they started recruiting young men to join a Norman brigade of the hoped-for Federalist army, to join with the brigades no doubt being raised in Bordeaux and Lyon and Marseille.

[(21:57)](#!):

But the recruitment turned out to be tougher than they thought \xe2\x80\x94 a problem that was eventually run into by all the other Federalist leaders. Because when one of the main drivers of local opposition to Paris is the fact that they’re trying to institute a draft, well good luck trying to get anyone to join an army. So when the Girondins in Normandy staged a rally on July 7, they were only able to muster about 2,500 to march around on parade. But though this showing did not impress many, it did impress 24-year-old Charlotte Corday, who was at that moment about as rabidly anti-Jacobin as any woman in France this side of Marie Antoinette.

[(22:39)](#!):

Charlotte Corday came from a family of minor Norman gentry, and seems to have spent her childhood inhaling Rousseau and Roman history, emerging as a fierce Republican idealist who was furious that the Revolution had been hijacked by the bloodthirsty tyrants of the Jacobin Club who were perverting the Revolution. The purge of the noble and moderate Girondins was just further proof that the Revolution had been hijacked by a gang of dangerous pirates, and she nodded approvingly at every new anti-Jacobin tract that emerged from the little Girondin headquarters that had set up shop right next door to her house in Caen.

[(23:18)](#!):

Above all, she hated the murderous little troll Jean-Paul Marat, and no doubt nodded very approvingly when she read a circular that was going around that read, let Marat’s head fall and the Republic is saved. Purge France of this man of blood. His head must fall to save 200,000 others.

[(23:39)](#!):

This is of course a quote that I’m happy to highlight, since we all remember when King Charles was denounced with that same reference to the biblical man of blood, the man who must be killed for the realm to be redeemed. On July 9th, Charlotte Corday boarded a stagecoach for Paris. She had decided it was time to redeem the Revolution by purging France of the man of blood. She arrived in the capital on July 12th, took up lodgings, and set to work. Her initial plan was to apparently kill Marat right on the floor of the convention in a dramatic act of patriotism, but she soon discovered that Marat had recently been forced to quit attending sessions. He was suffering from some kind of painful skin disease that could now only be soothed by soaking in a cool bath, and stricken by a particularly bad flare-up, he now rarely left his room and worked full-time at a makeshift desk sitting in a bathtub.

[(24:37)](#!):

But despite being robbed of her intended stage, Corday pressed on with her plan. She purchased a kitchen knife from a vendor at the Palais Royale, and the next day, July 13th, 1793, she headed down to the Cordelier district to talk her way into an audience with the man of blood.

[(24:57)](#!):

Her first attempt to gain an audience failed, but the second time she shouted loudly enough for Marat to hear that she had information about the Girondins who had fled up to Normandy. His interest peaked, Marat called down to let this noisy young woman come up. Corday was then escorted into Marat’s room, and under the suspicious eye of one of his housekeepers, proceeded to feed Marat exactly what he wanted to hear.

[(25:22)](#!):

After about fifteen minutes, the two were finally left alone, and that’s when Corday got up, pulled out the knife, and plunged it into Marat’s chest. The screaming brought the whole neighborhood running, and they were horrified by what they saw the great friend of the people dying rapidly in a bath filled with his own blood, and the murderer right there not even really trying to get away.

[(25:47)](#!):

Corday was taken into custody, and interrogated by the authorities who pressed and pressed and pressed for the names of the men who had put her up to it. But she swore up and down that no one had put her up to it, that it was all her idea, and that it had been an act of patriotic duty. Ra was the man of blood. He had to die to save thousands of innocent lives and avert civil war.

[(26:12)](#!):

Very put out that they did not have a huge conspiracy to crack down on, the Paris authorities then tossed Corday into the conciergerie. She was guillotined before a huge crowd on July the seventeenth, believing her own death to be a noble sacrifice, and that she had struck the first critical blow in the war against Jacobin tyranny.

[(26:34)](#!):

But sadly for Corday, her actions did not help bring about the end of Jacobin tyranny, and in many ways she helped bolster their cause. Marat overnight became a revolutionary martyr. His funeral was carefully orchestrated to exalt him as a popular hero, and eventually something of a cult grew up around him. When de-Christianization really starts getting going, busts of Marat would often replace crucifixes in co-opted churches.

[(27:03)](#!):

Now, interestingly enough, though, Marat’s remains were not immediately transferred into the pantheon as we all might imagine they would have been. It was not until after the Termidorian reaction\xe2\x80\x94that is, after the fall of Robespierre\xe2\x80\x94that Marat was dug up and put into the pantheon, and that seemed to be simply a PR stunt to try to link the Termidorians to the beloved revolutionary martyr. But wherever his body lay, the Jacobins deployed the memory of Marat to boost their own image and attack their opponents. So in a big way, Corday’s assassination of Marat only strengthened the position of the men she hoped to destroy.

[(27:44)](#!):

Doubly sadly for Corday, the Girondins\xe2\x80\x94on whose behalf she had died\xe2\x80\x94were not about to come storming down to retake Paris, and across France their struggle to raise willing recruits to form a Federalist army went nowhere. A few thousand joined up in Bordeaux, but those guys didn’t want to leave Bordeaux. A few thousand joined up in Marseille, but those guys didn’t want to leave Marseille. The Federalist leaders never got anywhere near the pipe dream of 80,000 men they hoped to raise. The Federalist revolt, such as it was, would remain a series of independent uprisings, and could thus be dealt with each in their own turn.

[(28:24)](#!):

Not that anyone knew the Federalist uprising wasn’t going to turn out to be as dire as predicted, and certainly not the leaders of the Allied coalition. Though the French armies just about everywhere were demoralized, and reinforced only by recruits raised by the lev\xc3\xa9 of 300,000 who were both inexperienced and not a little bit sullen about being drafted, the Allies did not go on the attack. Their firm belief was that the small clique of radicals in Paris were about to be consumed by the combined effort to the Vaud\xc3\xa9 uprising and the Federalist insurrections, and that the entire revolutionary project was about to collapse into a busted pile of rubble broken by internal strife and civil war. All they needed to do was maintain pressure on the periphery, and the center would collapse all by itself.

[(29:17)](#!):

This Allied lack of aggression, though, was not enough to save old General Kustina, who took command of the Army of the North on May 29th. He barely got his feet wet before being stripped of that command and ordered back to Paris. His crime? Not immediately relieving the now hopelessly unrelievable city of Cond\xc3\xa9, which finally capitulated on July 12th.

[(29:41)](#!):

Ordered back to Paris after the fall of Cond\xc3\xa9, Kustina was arrested by the revolutionary authorities just as word was coming in that the garrison he had left behind in Mainz had finally surrendered on July 23rd, and that then the garrison at Valenciennes had done the same on July 28th. Tossed into the conciergerie, Kustina would be convicted of negligence by the Revolutionary Tribunal and eventually guillotined in the Reign of Terror. As you can imagine, the applications just flooded in to take over the Army of the North.

[(30:14)](#!):

But as I just mentioned, instead of capitalizing on their victories and the weakness of the French, the Allies elected to linger on the periphery, and up in Belgium they simply moved off to take two more fortress cities rather than truly launch an invasion. And they were further held back by Prime Minister William Pitt’s insistence that the Allies lay siege to Dunkirk, which wasn’t a particularly vital stronghold in terms of winning the war, but which was the main spoil of war Pitt had his eyes on.

[(30:45)](#!):

So the huge Allied army on the Belgian frontier, now numbering almost 100,000, was divided up and dispatched to their various sieges, totally unaware that France was not about to implode on itself, and was in fact about to explode against all of them, and that they had just missed a golden opportunity to end the war right there.

[(31:08)](#!):

As all of this was unfolding, the so-called Constitution of 1793 was circulating through France. That is, the parts of France not currently in armed revolt. And when the vote came back in, the Constitution turned out to be accepted by an overwhelming margin, signaling widespread support not just for the Constitution itself, but also for the Jacobins who had drafted it. The margin of victory was so huge it was almost unbelievable. The reported numbers were 1,800,000 yes, 11,000 no.

[(31:46)](#!):

Yes, that is correct, 1.8 million to 11,000, it’s almost unbelievable. Like maybe they were just some numbers that the Jacobins back in Paris had decided sounded like a comfortable enough margin of victory. Which isn’t to say that the Constitution wasn’t popular. It was. And that’s not to say that the kind of men who might show up in the primary assemblies to vote on it weren’t predisposed to favor the Constitution. They were. Just a 1.8 million to 11,000? I mean, come on guys, at least make your ballot stuffing plausible.

[(32:20)](#!):

In part to celebrate this glorious ratification of the great Constitution of 1793, the Parisians threw a massive party called the Festival of the Unity and Indivisibility of the Republic. Which yeah, that doesn’t sound like you’re trying to convince yourself of something that is flying in the face of reality. The Roving Festival was staged on August the 10th, 1793, the first anniversary of the toppling of the monarchy, and was orchestrated by artist and ardent revolutionary Jacques-Louis David. It involved the Parisians moving on a set path from location to location, starting at the remains of the Bastille and ending at the Champs de Mars. Along the way, David had erected huge theatrical stage works to celebrate this or that aspect of the Revolution. And in case anyone was wondering what the Parisians thought of those out in the provinces who had risen up against them, one station along the route showed Hercules preparing to kill an evil monster representing federalism. Not exactly a call for reconciliation or fraternity, nor exactly signaling the unity and indivisibility of the Republic.

[(33:32)](#!):

And what was the fate of the Constitution of 1793 that they were all in part celebrating the ratification of? Well, when a delegate in the National Convention stood up the next day to suggest calling elections for the new legislature, he was practically laughed out of the room. There were far too many emergencies out there to risk inaugurating a new government. The elections would be postponed. And then they would be permanently postponed. The Constitution of 1793 would never be put into effect. And next week, we will introduce the men of the reconstituted Committee of Public Safety to whom the fate of the Revolution would be entrusted, since the fate of the Revolution could clearly not be entrusted, to the people of France.

Now this time, I’m going to hop back a revolution because I just discovered that the TV series Tern, which tells the story of the spy ring George Washington organized to extract intelligence from the British occupying New York, is currently available for streaming online so I can finally watch it. The series is based on Washington’s Spies, the story of America’s first spy ring by Alexander Rose, which has gotten excellent reviews for revealing a little-known but very important component of the war Washington was running after major combat operations died down following the Battle of Monmouth. So when you’re done with this episode, go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash revolutions so that they know who sent you. Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.32 The Committee of Public Safety As the array of political and military disasters that erupted on all fronts in mid-1793 threatened to consume revolutionary France, the now mountain-dominated National Convention decided that they were absolutely not going to go down without a fight. The Federalists would be crushed. The rebels in the Vaud\xc3\xa9 exterminated. The old regimes of Europe would be conquered by the armies of France. They aimed for nothing less than total victory on all fronts.

[(02:13)](#!):

But accomplishing this extraordinarily ambitious plan would require a far more omnipotent national government than the Revolution had yet allowed. And it is one of the great ironies of the French Revolution that just as it was publicly celebrating the super-democratic constitution of 1793, it was simultaneously being converted into an authoritarian dictatorship, a dictatorship run through the newly reorganized Committee of Public Safety.

[(02:41)](#!):

The Committee of Public Safety had been established back in March as a direct response to the terrible news coming down from Belgium and then out of Vend\xc3\xa9e. And as I mentioned, the dominant figure of the first few months of the Committee’s existence was Georges Danton, who had become, of late, a voice of moderation. But as the bad news from all fronts continued to flood in, the delegates left in the National Convention after the purge of the Girondins were now open to the argument that moderation very possibly meant death. As we will see in a few moments, though, the turn away from moderation did not imply a turn toward further radicalism. Instead, the turn away from moderation was in the direction of, let’s call it, uncompromising patriotic commitment that would tolerate challenges from neither the right nor the left. The coming Jacobin reign of terror, a far more colorful way of putting it than uncompromising patriotic commitment, would be directed as much against the populace on the left as against crypto-royalists on the right.

[(03:46)](#!):

The first move in this turn against moderation was the removal of Danton from the Committee of Public Safety. As we’ve seen, ever since the insurrection of August 10 and the September massacres, Danton had been projecting an image of himself as a pragmatic and level-headed statesman, rather than as a fire-breathing agitator. His patriotism had already been called into question after he publicly supported the treasonous General Dumourieu, and after the insurrection of May 31, June 2, suspicions about his commitment to the revolutionary cause only grew.

[(04:21)](#!):

Rather than promoting vindictive reprisals against the federalist insurrectionaries, Danton counseled leniency\xe2\x80\x94bring them back into the fold with the carrot, not the stick. His answer to the collapse of the armies in Belgium was to try to open negotiations with the Prussians to try to dislodge them from the allied coalition. Danton’s apparent willingness to bargain with the revolution’s enemies rather than crush them sparked a political backlash. When the monthly elections for the Committee of Public Safety came around again on July 10, Danton, ostensibly its most powerful member, was not re-elected. Nor were any of his allies.

[(05:01)](#!):

And though Danton would remain a powerful force for months to come, this is really the moment when he and the old Cordelier inner circle\xe2\x80\x94once the most extreme leading edge of the revolution\xe2\x80\x94will begin their tragic march to the guillotine. The new Committee of Public Safety that started to take shape on July 10 promised to be more vigorous in its approach to everything. Their mission was nothing less than the salvation of France and the revolution, and they would work tirelessly and without remorse until that mission was complete.

[(05:34)](#!):

As young Saint-Just said, those who would make revolution in the world, those who want to do good in this world, must sleep only in the tomb. You can accuse the Committee of Public Safety of a lot of things, but you cannot accuse them of being lazy.

[(05:53)](#!):

After the election of July the 10th removed moderate voices from the committee, a series of supplemental appointments over the next few months brought the total number of committee members up to twelve, and it was these twelve men who would turn the Committee of Public Safety into the engine of terror that continues to haunt the Western imagination. Each of the twelve is interesting and important in his own way, but it would be silly to sit here and rattle them off to you one by one, because by the time I got to guy number twelve, you wouldn’t be able to remember who guy number one was. So what I’ll do right now is highlight a few of the really important members, and then in the episodes to come, introduce the others as they enter and exit the stage.

[(06:34)](#!):

So for now, let’s first of all remember that Louis-Antoine de Saint-Just, a la 26 years old, had already been appointed to the committee back in June to work on the Constitution of 1793, and he was elected to an official spot on July the 10th. The most famous member of the committee, though, was not elected on July the 10th, and that was of course Saint-Just’s mentor, the indomitable leader of the mountain, Maximilien Robespierre.

[(07:01)](#!):

Robespierre, oddly enough, continued to cast a skeptical eye on the committee he was destined to dominate, and he was not persuaded to take a seat until July the 27th. Once he showed up, though, Robespierre would become the committee’s voice inside the convention, defending its conduct and its further consolidation of power, and then of course serve as the key ideologue of the whole project. And in short order, Robespierre would emerge as the anchor of the political wing of the committee, the wing most concerned with rooting out and destroying the enemies of the revolution, and this would eventually lead Robespierre to put the committee, and by extension all of France, under his personal control.

[(07:44)](#!):

But in the midst of the crisis of mid-1793, the political wing of the committee was emphatically not the most important wing of the committee, because though consolidating national political power was a key objective, the really, really key objective was the objective that would ultimately make the consolidation of national power possible, and that was winning the war. So on August the 14th, two more men were appointed to the committee who would anchor what I’ll call the military wing, and of those two men, one of them deserves special attention because he is going to go down in history as the great organizer of victory, the man who almost single-handedly turned the fortunes of war around and kept revolutionary France from being defeated by all her enemies right then and there in 1793. Lazare Carnot.

[(08:38)](#!):

So though the ideological terror unleashed by Robespierre and the political wing is more famous, had Carnot and the military wing not succeeded, and wildly succeeded as it would turn out, the political wing never would have had the power or the legitimacy to do what it did. Lazare Carnot had been born up in Burgundy in 1753, and from an early age he showed a great aptitude in math and science. He went off to study at a military college specifically focused on artillery and engineering, where he established a reputation as one of the brightest minds of his generation. But unfortunately, Carnot was a commoner entering the ranks of the Army of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, which as you might recall from way back when, was currently in the process of making it even harder for non-nobles to rise to senior positions. So despite his obvious abilities, Carnot was commissioned as a lieutenant, soon promoted to captain, and from there left to languish, despite the fact that in his spare time he was actually making genuine advances to theoretical and practical physics, and publishing papers that were very well received by the scientific community.

[(09:50)](#!):

So for obvious reasons, Carnot was sympathetic to the Revolution when it broke out, and though he was not, and never would be, a politician per se, he had spent a lot of time thinking about the kinds of reforms that, oh let’s say the Army could use if it was going to survive in the modern world. So he stood for, and won a seat in the Legislative Assembly in 1791. Now try as I might, I cannot find a source that will tell me what Carnot thought about the warmongering of Brissaux and the Girondins, whether he supported them, or thought the whole thing crazy, and if anybody out there has any idea, please drop me a line.

[(10:29)](#!):

After the king was overthrown in August 1792, Carnot was dispatched to the Army of the Rhine to ensure that the officer corps there was prepared to fight for the new regime. Then he was elected into the national convention, but was basically absent from Paris the whole time, being dispatched first down to the Pyrenees to set up a defensive line to block any advance by the Spanish, a line that unfortunately did not hold after he left, and then when things started going badly up in Belgium, he was one of those representatives on mission sent up to hold the line.

[(11:03)](#!):

Now Carnot was, to be sure, in favor of aggressive action, and he was one of the ones pushing the generals to fight and not retreat.

[(11:12)](#!):

But Carnot was far more of a military technocrat than some raging ideologue, and after witnessing firsthand the setbacks that followed Dumourier’s defection, Carnot came away convinced that the army was not suffering from a lack of ideological commitment, so much as a lack of manpower, proper organization, training, material, and he started sketching plans to completely transform the French armies. When he was recalled from the front lines and appointed to the Committee of Public Safety on August 14 and told, hey man, go win the war, he already had a pretty good idea of exactly what needed to be done.

[(11:51)](#!):

So it did not take long for new committee member Carnot to roll out his great project, and on August the 23rd, the Committee of Public Safety decreed, and the national convention supported, the justly famous la vie en masse, the simultaneous mobilization of the entire nation to arms. The la vie en masse bluntly demanded that the citizens of France recognize an absolute and universal obligation to serve in the military. From here on out, every citizen was a potential soldier.

[(12:24)](#!):

The first round of conscriptions specifically targeted all unmarried men ages 18 to 25, and more specifically, those unmarried young men in regions that were currently threatened by either foreign attack or local federalist insurrection. The idea was to simply raise so many men so fast that they would overwhelm the revolution’s enemies. Before I really started picking my way through the minutiae of the French Revolution, I knew that the la vie en masse was a big deal, but I never realized just how truly audacious it was. I mean, it was just back in February that the convention issued the la vie of 300,000, and look what that had gotten them, the Vaudet Uprising and the Federalist Revolt. So to go back to that same well looking not just for more water, but for all the water? Well that’s pretty crazy.

[(13:16)](#!):

But it worked. So you’re probably wondering why the la vie en masse wound up working given the oh-so recent wave of anti-draft riots back in the spring. The answer is, first of all, as successful as the la vie en masse turned out to be, quickly raising 300,000 and eventually leading to somewhere between 750 and 800,000 Frenchmen under arms by the end of the year, there was a lot of draft dodging everywhere. And let’s just say, for example, that the marriage rates in France mysteriously skyrocketed in September 1793 just as commissioners were coming around looking for unmarried men to ship off to the front lines.

[(13:58)](#!):

But those that did submit were doing so under very different circumstances than when the la vie of 300,000 was going around. Back in February, the French armies on the frontier were still ascendant, and the call to arms was premised on an abstract need to reinforce the army.

[(14:15)](#!):

But by the fall of 1793, everything had gone to hell. Foreign armies were camped inside French territory. The Federalist cities were calling for civil war. The vaudez was on fire. Representatives on mission and local commissioners could plausibly argue that if you didn’t step up and do your duty, that revolutionary France would be crushed, and with it, any hope that you might have of not just going back to being some oppressed peasant resettled to the yoke of a restored aristocracy.

[(14:47)](#!):

But the la vie en masse was really successful because it was not just about raising troops. It was about putting everyone and everything to work to win the war. And this was described in the opening of the decree announcing the la vie.

[(15:03)](#!):

From this moment until such time as its enemy shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight. The married men shall forge arms and transport provisions. The women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals. The children shall turn old lint into linen. The old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.

[(15:38)](#!):

What all of that meant was that just as the Allies were anticipating the imminent collapse of France, France was instead transforming itself into a massive war machine. Even before the la vie had a chance to start making a difference, things actually started to look not quite so dire. When that little Girondin-led brigade of Norman Federalists tried to rally further support by marching towards Paris in July, they were broken and dispersed the moment they made contact with a National Guard brigade sent to stop them.

[(16:12)](#!):

By the middle of August, Bordeaux was pulling back from its lofty dreams of everyone getting together and marching on the capital, and was hunkering down to brace for reprisals from Paris. In the east, both Lyon and Marseille were themselves facing the prospect of fighting regular army troops who were now redirected from their bases along the Alpine border to come down and retake the rebel cities. We’ll come back to Lyon next week, since they’re going to hold out until October, and the subsequent reprisals visited upon the city will form an integral part of the opening of the Reign of Terror. But Marseille is about to capitulate, so let’s take care of that right now.

[(16:53)](#!):

Marseille was of course already suffering from an Allied blockade. That was part of the reason they had gone into revolt in the first place. But with regular troops now on the way, the Federalist leaders inside the city decided that the only way to survive was to open negotiations with the British to hand Marseille over to the Allies in exchange for provisions and protection.

[(17:16)](#!):

But when word of these negotiations leaked, it sparked a backlash, as most of the citizens who had supported the revolt against Paris were emphatic that they did not do it just to hand the keys to the city over to the British. After a series of street clashes, the most extreme Federalists were run out of the city, and Marseille surrendered to the approaching regular troops on August the 25th. But though this was welcome news in Paris, the explosive news that followed right on its heels really, really wasn’t. And that news precipitated yet another insurrection in the capital.

[(17:54)](#!):

What had happened is that those hardcore Federalists who fled Marseille made their way over to Toulon, which just so happened to be the home base of the French navy in the Mediterranean. With the capture of Marseille no longer an option, the British turned to the people of Toulon and made them the same deal that they had just offered to Marseille. Let us sail in, and we’ll protect you.

[(18:17)](#!):

This proposal caused just as much heated controversy as it had in Marseille, but with the hardcore Federalists from Marseille now turning up with stories of vicious atrocities committed by the Jacobin-controlled regular troops, stories that for the moment were a bit overblown, the citizens of Toulon opted for what appeared to be the lesser of two evils. On August the 27th, they invited the British to sail into the harbor, thus allowing the Allies to capture the French naval yards without firing a shot.

[(18:48)](#!):

When word reached Paris of the betrayal of Toulon on September the 2nd, it fed into another round of angry unrest already rising in the capital that soon culminated with yet another popular insurrection on September the 5th, an insurrection that would mark the beginning of the Reign of Terror. In many ways, the insurrection of September the 5th looks a lot like the insurrections of May 31st, June the 2nd. Both involved angry sans-culottes arming themselves, surrounding the convention, and demanding a whole slate of populist reforms, with the convention then capitulating. But is that really what happened on September the 5th?

[(19:30)](#!):

As it turns out, no, not really, and the insurrection of September the 5th does not represent yet another stage in the process of increasing radicalization that has been ongoing since the Estates General first met way back in May 1789. Instead, it marks the end of that process. Now this is not the end of uncompromising patriotic commitment, not by a long shot, but this is the end of the ever-increasing political and economic radicalization of the revolution. That is not really how it looks on the surface, though, and there’s a lot of political sleight of hand going on here, so let’s get into it.

[(20:10)](#!):

To understand the insurrection of September the 5th, we must first understand the role played by Jacques H\xc3\xa9bert. H\xc3\xa9bert, you probably don’t remember, was one of the two men arrested by the Commission of Twelve back in May, arrests that helped trigger the purge of the Girondins. H\xc3\xa9bert was a left-wing journalist who had been publishing a popular newspaper since 1790. He had started out advocating liberal-noble-esque constitutional royalism, but like so many others, the flight to Varenne turned H\xc3\xa9bert against the monarchy and in favor of making France a republic.

[(20:48)](#!):

He was present at the massacre of the Champs-de-Mars, and after that his paper became a windmill of attacks against the king and the queen and Lafayette, and most especially the Catholic Church. H\xc3\xa9bert was an avowed atheist and one of the leading proponents of total de-Christianization. All of this earned him enormous popularity among the sans-culottes and helped him secure a seat on the Insurrectionary Commune after August the 10th. From that seat, he supported the September massacres and used his paper to publicly defend the necessity of the slaughter.

[(21:26)](#!):

But though H\xc3\xa9bert was obviously a far-left radical, he was also personally at odds with most of the Enrag\xc3\xa9 leaders and vied with them for influence over the sans-culottes. And it was much to his chagrin that the Commission of Twelve lumped him in with the street maniacs when they went out looking for people to arrest. H\xc3\xa9bert’s other great rival for the hearts of the sans-culottes was of course Jean-Paul Marat, though it wasn’t really much of a rivalry. H\xc3\xa9bert published in Marat’s shadow.

[(21:59)](#!):

Everyone did. But when Marat was assassinated in July, H\xc3\xa9bert was determined to corner the market on revolutionary populism. And he was mostly successful. The circulation of his paper skyrocketed, and in no time H\xc3\xa9bert became what Marat had so recently been\xe2\x80\x94the most influential left-wing journalist in Paris. But as he was donning the mantle of the voice of the people, H\xc3\xa9bert turned his virulent pen as much against the Enrag\xc3\xa9 as against squishy moderates in the National Convention. And he was about to help orchestrate a plot to push the Enrag\xc3\xa9 off the stage\xe2\x80\x94or more precisely, up onto the scaffold.

[(22:40)](#!):

In September 1793, Jacques H\xc3\xa9bert was wearing a number of different hats. He was of course editor and publisher of a hugely popular newspaper. But he also sat on the central council of the Paris Commune, and was a member in good standing of the Jacobin Club. This meant that he had followers in the street, power in city government, and plenty of allies in the National Convention.

[(23:04)](#!):

So when the streets once again began to get restless after news that Toulon had surrendered, H\xc3\xa9bert and his allies in the Commune, the Jacobin Club, and the Convention helped organize a popular uprising that would help them all co-opt the Enrag\xc3\xa9 platform, win the loyalty of the Saint-Qilat, and eliminate the Enrag\xc3\xa9 as an independent political force.

[(23:27)](#!):

On September 4, a mostly spontaneous demonstration outside the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville by workers demanding economic relief provided the perfect opportunity to initiate the plan. As a member of the Commune, H\xc3\xa9bert went out and told the workers to come back tomorrow, and we’ll have ourselves a real organized insurrection. Then he declared September 5 a work holiday to ensure a large turnout for the coming show. This time, of course, the leading delegates of the National Convention were not surprised when this mob showed up, and were instead prepared to receive them. And when the mob showed up on September 5, the co-opting began in earnest.

[(24:07)](#!):

As we’ve seen, the Enrag\xc3\xa9s, more than anything else, were driven by economic concerns. They had no money, they had no food, and their demands on September 5 reflected this. They said, above all, we demand subsistence, and demand that the government provide that subsistence by any means necessary. They wanted that promised revolutionary army to be raised so it could go charge around seizing the food that they just knew was being hoarded by the wealthy. They wanted those units equipped with mobile guillotines to enforce revolutionary order.

[(24:42)](#!):

They wanted no more compromises, no more moderation. Appeals to patriotism and compassion and national unity were clearly not working. So they demanded that terror be the order of the day, that is, that the government use unflinching violence to ensure compliance with its decrees. On the surface, the sans-culottes certainly appeared to get most of what they demanded. But the concessions offered by the convention were designed mostly to complete the process of power centralization that had been ongoing since the insurrection of June 2.

[(25:17)](#!):

For example, though that revolutionary army that we’ve been talking about was finally given the green light to organize, it was initially limited to just 6,500 men. And when the 6,500 most militant sans-culottes in Paris joined up and went out into the countryside looking for grain, guess where they weren’t anymore? That’s right, in Paris, causing trouble for the convention.

[(25:41)](#!):

Then there was the quote-unquote concession, proposed by Danton by the by, that men be paid for attending the sectional assemblies, and that those assemblies would be held twice a week. Now that sounds great, right? Except that the sectional assemblies had been in permanent session since the insurrection of August 10, so the twice-a-week mandate was really about severely limiting their ability to organize rather than enhancing it. And the payments for attendance? Well, that’s just straight buying people off, because it would be the convention doing the paying, not the sections themselves. And wherefore comes the money? So too goes the loyalty.

[(26:22)](#!):

Then the convention agreed on September 6 to appoint two new members to the Committee of Public Safety, and these two appointments would bring the total up to the infamous 12. These were two men who were adored by the sans-culottes, Jean-Marie Collot de Bois and Jacques-Nicola Biovarin.

[(26:42)](#!):

These two men would in time become the most infamous architects of the terror, but for the moment, their inclusion on the committee was all about legitimizing the Committee of Public Safety in the eyes of the sans-culottes, and ensure that their especially uncompromising brand of patriotic commitment would be directed on behalf of the committee, rather than against the committee. In the weeks that followed, further popular initiatives were handed down that again gave the appearance of radical populism, but which were mostly deployed to further consolidate central power. On September 11, another grain maximum was decreed that promised to keep the price of bread down. Once it was decreed, the harvest, collection, and transportation of grain was put under the direct supervision of the Committee of Public Safety.

[(27:32)](#!):

Then on September 17, the Law of Suspects massively broadened both the definition of suspect and the surveillance powers of the authorities to the point that basically anyone could now be dragged before the Revolutionary Tribunal for any reason at any time. Now these enhanced police powers were technically put under the control of the Convention’s Committee of General Security, the committee that had been mostly superseded by the Committee of Public Safety, but which still had jurisdiction over local police and reports of domestic treason. Now the sans-culottes wanted the jurisdiction of the Revolutionary Tribunal expanded, and suspects easier to arrest, because they were envisioning an all-out war on rich hoarders who live fat on the food that they were intentionally withholding from Paris.

[(28:21)](#!):

But the Committee of General Security had no plans to use their enhanced police powers to simply wage class war. Dominated by allies of Jacques Hebert, the Committee of General Security instead used it first to crush their enemies on the left. One of the first men arrested after the new Law of Suspects was decreed was none other than Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Varlet, Varlet being the other guy arrested by the Commission of Twelve along with Hebert back in May. Three days later, another of the major enrag\xc3\xa9s, Theophil Leclerc, was intimidated into silence. Threatened with arrest, he ceased publication of his radical newspaper.

[(29:02)](#!):

But what about the ultra-radical priest Jacques Roux, the most famous of the enrag\xc3\xa9s? Oh that’s right, he’s already in jail. He was arrested on the night of September 5th for his role in inciting the insurrection. All of this is going to mark the end of the enrag\xc3\xa9s as a political force. A few weeks later, the convention then completed its co-option of the sans-culottes by rolling out an even more ambitious economic program. On September 29th, they decreed the General Maximum.

[(29:35)](#!):

The General Maximum laid down a set of maximum prices for all sorts of essential commodities. Grain, flour, oil, meat, firewood, paper, soap, leather. The General Maximum was loved by the end-consumer sans-culottes in Paris, but was of course pretty much a disaster for everyone else. It legitimized the notion that high prices were caused by hoarders and price gougers and profiteers, rather than the basic mechanism of too little supply meeting too much demand.

[(30:08)](#!):

Enforcement of the General Maximum was then folded into the law of suspects, and pretty soon shopkeepers either had to sell their goods for less than they cost to acquire, or be denounced as traders and executed. The General Maximum, though, worked great in one respect. It pretty much defused any possibility that the convention had to fear another sans-culottes uprising, which is really what it was designed to do.

[(30:36)](#!):

As I’ve said now repeatedly, the insurrection of September 5th was not about putting into place a more radical political and economic program for its own sake. This was all about giving the state, as personified by the Committee of Public Safety, essentially unlimited power to do whatever it wanted and the means to enforce their will. So we are now a long, long ways from the tennis court oath and the declaration of the rights of man. The French Revolution is now fundamentally no longer about liberty and rights. It is about obedience and sacrifice.

[(31:14)](#!):

What had begun as a project to free the individual from the capricious tyranny of the state had now become the opposite. The individual now existed to serve the needs of the state, needs to find now by the twelve men of the Committee of Public Safety. And if he refused, Madame La Guillotine awaits, because terror is the order of the day.

[(31:37)](#!):

So next week, we will begin the dark and bloody reign of terror, when the revolution will well and truly begin to devour its children.

Episode 3.33 \xe2\x80\x93 The Geography of Terror So last time, we brought ourselves right up to the beginning of the Reign of Terror, which is about to descend on France. But though the Terror played out as a bloody game of sadistic revolutionary partisanship in Paris, the bulk of its victims were not major political figures, but rather obscure men and women out in the departments, specifically in those departments currently in insurrection.

[(02:49)](#!):

Contrary to the popular myth that the Terror was about the poor killing the rich, or the peasants killing the aristocrats, it was actually far more about eliminating opponents of decentralizing revolutionary government in Paris, and scaring everyone else into submission.

[(03:05)](#!):

Through July 1794, there will be 16,594 official victims of the Terror, that is, those specifically condemned by the revolutionary tribunals or representatives on mission and guillotine. Of those, 1,900 will come from the regions surrounding Lyon, 1,300 will come from the regions surrounding Marseille and Toulon, and a whopping 8,700 will come from the Vaudet. Add those together, and we’re talking about 70% of the total victims right there. Add the 2,600 killed in Paris, and now we’re talking about almost 90% of the victims of the Terror coming from four very specific locations.

[(03:46)](#!):

Now we’ll get into all the fun in Paris next week, where the Reign of Terror will be kicked off by the show trial and execution of Marie Antoinette, and then the show trial and execution of the Girondins, but I want to spend today circling the frontiers to bring the course of events outside the capital up to speed, because that’s really where the Great Terror is going to play out. But I need to start today by heading back up to the war front in Belgium, because if the French don’t start winning some battles, they’ll never get a chance to chop each other’s heads off.

[(04:18)](#!):

So when last we left the cursed army of the north, the French had been getting kicked around and their generals had been getting arrested and guillotined, which is really kind of an interesting way to try to win a war. As you will recall, after their run of victories in July 1793, the Allies decided not to invade the heart of France though, and instead divided up and went off to lay a couple of more sieges on the periphery. The Austrians headed down to the fortress city of La Quinoa and began a siege on August 28th. Meanwhile, the British and Hanoverian forces under the grand old Duke of York headed up to Dunkirk.

[(04:55)](#!):

Now the move on Dunkirk, as I said, was less about immediate necessities of war than about fulfilling the long term political and economic dreams of the British. But this diversion wasn’t supposed to be that big of a deal. Dunkirk would fall quickly, France would collapse shortly thereafter. But then neither of those things happened, and before they knew it, the British were in full on retreat back to the Netherlands.

[(05:22)](#!):

The British failure to take Dunkirk was mostly a failure of logistical coordination. When the British armies showed up outside the city, they were supposed to be met by the British navy, but there was no navy. There was supposed to be a delivery of heavy siege guns, but there were no guns. The artillery company who was going to fire the guns got dropped off, but there were no guns for them to fire.

[(05:44)](#!):

When ships did appear on the horizon, they turned out to be French gunboats who immediately started blasting away on the British position. As the Duke of York started digging in, expecting support, you know, any day now, the French army started massing south of Dunkirk for a relief effort. Reinforced by the first waves of recruits from the Laveille en masse, about 40,000 men were concentrated south of the city by early September.

[(06:11)](#!):

And as I mentioned those new recruits, I should also mention one of the big innovations that is going to help the French really start kicking ass out there. A while back, I mentioned that the War Committee of the old Legislative Assembly had recommended integrating new recruits with veterans of the line for basically all the reasons you might think that would be a good idea. Well now is the moment when this finally starts taking effect. Known as the Amalgam\xc3\xa9, the pairing of recruits raised from the Laveille en masse with guys who had already been fighting for months and even years. This integration program dramatically increased the speed with which new troops could be turned into effective soldiers.

[(06:50)](#!):

Now the Amalgam\xc3\xa9 was not without its detractors, and Saint-Culot purists wanted to keep the Laveille en masse guys as their own separate brigades to maintain political purity. That way they wouldn’t be poisoned by the cynical and probably royalist professional soldiers. But the representatives on mission in the army made it quite clear that the Amalgam\xc3\xa9 was going to be a thing, and so it was, and it turned out to have been absolutely the right call.

[(07:19)](#!):

As the forces south of Dunkirk swelled, the senior military officers, the representatives on mission, and then the Committee of Public Safety back in Paris discussed how to proceed. And one thing that has become clear to me in trying to get a handle on all of this is that it’s very difficult to tell where ideas and strategies really came from. Like who was to blame for failures, and who deserves credit for successes.

[(07:44)](#!):

As everyone jockeyed with everyone else in an effort to avoid the guillotine, the rush to take credit for the good and blame someone else for the bad became a regular habit. And I’m not talking just about the officers. Even someone like Lazare Carnot, who is regarded these days as indispensable to the war effort, while his position in the fall of 1793 was no more secure than anyone else’s. One wrong move, and he might get swept off to the guillotine himself. So as we walk through this, I think it’s fair to say that we know what happened. But it’s definitely cobbled together from a bunch of unreliable witnesses who were far more interested in living another day than in writing an objective and honest account of the action.

[(08:31)](#!):

So by now you’re probably wondering, okay well who is nominally in charge of the Army of the North? Who has been given the mother of all cursed promotions? Well I’ll tell you. This week’s poor sod is Jean-Nicolas Uchard. Initially the promotion of Uchard was greeted with some enthusiasm. He was a commoner, and so for the first time in French history an army would be led by someone without a speck of noble blood. So this was a pretty big deal politically. But unfortunately, if you are looking to prove that a commoner can do the job just as well as some noble, Jean-Nicolas Uchard is not the man you’re looking for.

[(09:12)](#!):

At the dawn of the Revolution, he had been in the army for 24 years, and had risen to the rank of cavalry captain, and never commanded more than a single company. But he was promoted along with everyone else once the old senior officers started ditching out through 1791 and 1792. But each promotion took Uchard further away from what he was good at, and that was bravely leading small units in battle, and toward something he was bad at, which is coordinating large armies and successfully planning a complicated operation on multiple fronts. And it’s not like Uchard didn’t know he wasn’t up for the job he had just been handed. He did know it, which just makes his fate all the more tragic.

[(09:58)](#!):

As if the new General Uchard needed reminding of what failure meant, a messenger from Paris came up and informed him that his old commander, the esteemed General Custina, had just been convicted of negligence by the Revolutionary Tribunal and guillotined on August 28. So there’s nothing quite like sitting around getting ready to start a job you don’t think you can do, knowing full well that when you don’t do it, you’ll be killed. As you can imagine, Uchard hesitated to start this job, but when the representatives on mission sensed his hesitation, they basically ordered him to get his butt in gear. So on the morning of September 6, 1793, Uchard put his troops into motion, directing them against the 20,000 or so allies spread out south of Dunkirk protecting the Duke of York’s flank. The two sides battled each other across a miles-long line in some pretty crappy weather, and though the allied forces were heavily outnumbered, they were only pushed back with supreme difficulty. The standard historical analysis is that Uchard spread his men across way too wide a front, and thus failed to take advantage of his superior numbers. By six in the evening, Uchard wanted to shut things down for the day, but he was ordered to keep going by the representative on mission looking over his shoulder, who said, quote, free men were never too tired to fight the slaves of tyrants. So on the French army went, eventually pushing the allies back into the town of Honshout, whereupon darkness finally put a stop to the day’s battle.

[(11:31)](#!):

The next day, the French were too scattered to do anything even with the representative breathing down Uchard’s neck, so it wasn’t until September the 8th that they were finally ready to attack the 15,000 allies holed up in Honshout. But rather than massing his guys for one big push, Uchard again spread his army out. He broke off 12,000 to head straight for Dunkirk, and then he had another 10,000 or so stationed like 20 miles to the southeast, not really doing much of anything.

[(12:01)](#!):

So he only advanced on Honshout with maybe 22,000 guys. But despite completely negating his overwhelming numerical superiority, the allies inside Honshout were pretty well battered, and so when the French launched their attack on the morning of September the 8th, the allies first took heavy casualties and then were forced to retreat. The Battle of Honshout forced the Duke of York to finally abandon his futile siege of Dunkirk. He had never received the reinforcements he requested to help him truly encircle the city. The siege guns had never arrived. The Navy had never arrived.

[(12:39)](#!):

So with his flank totally exposed, he said, forget it, we’re pulling out. Adding insult to injury, the combination of bad weather and the French defenders inside Dunkirk intentionally dumping all their wastewater into the Allied trenches, the British could not extract their heavy baggage nor the few heavy guns they did have. So literally bogged down, his retreat from Dunkirk was a slow slog.

[(13:05)](#!):

With all the Allies now in a stumbling retreat, the representative on mission told Ushar, go get him. But Ushar refused. His army was an exhausted mess, spread out all over the place, and the general just didn’t think they could handle further action. In a fleeting and ultimately fatal bit of self-confidence, he told the representative who was demanding more action, quote, you are not a military man, and the representative backed down. Oh, and in case you’re wondering, three days after the Duke of York ended the siege, the British Navy finally showed up.

[(13:44)](#!):

Instead of pouncing on the retreating British, Ushar instead gathered up his men and pointed them at La Quinoa. Now had Ushar managed to relieve La Quinoa, it’s possible, just possible, he might have kept his head. But he just didn’t have enough time. On September the 13th, his army successfully drove off about 15,000 Dutch from Muna, which cleared the road to La Quinoa. But that same day, the city surrendered to the Austrians. And then two days later, the French advance was reversed by a reinforced Allied army, and that was it for poor old General Ushar. He was arrested in Lille on September the 24th and hauled back to Paris to face the Revolutionary Tribunal, where he was accused of treason.

[(14:32)](#!):

But though the treason charge was utterly bogus, it wasn’t until one of the prosecutors called him a coward that Ushar was finally roused to defend himself. I mean, we’re talking about a guy whose face had been disfigured in the past by not only a gunshot wound to the mouth, but also a saber slash to the cheek. This was a guy whose chest was basically one big intertwined mess of scar tissue. He had led the middle column of the attack on Hans Schout personally. Ushar may have been out of his depth, guilty of incompetence and maybe even insubordination. But cowardice?

[(15:10)](#!):

Never. But they found him guilty anyway, and he was guillotined November the 17th. Okay, so who on earth is next going to get stuck with this death sentence of a command? Who is the next unlucky soul who will wind up running the army for two months before getting denounced, hauled back to Paris, and executed?

[(15:30)](#!):

Well as it turns out, we’re actually about to land on a guy who’s going to stick around for a while. A really long while, as it’ll turn out. He’s going to have his near misses with the Revolutionary Tribunal along the way, but in 31-year-old Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, we’ve finally got ourselves a survivor. Someone who can both run an army and avoid a revolutionary death sentence.

[(15:53)](#!):

And not to give anything away, but Jourdan is going to serve France in various capacities through everything. The Jacobin dictatorship, the Directory, the Napoleonic Empire, the restored monarchy, the July monarchy. Jourdan is going to die a well-respected son of France in 1834, the ripe old age of 71. And good for him.

[(16:17)](#!):

Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was born in 1762, the son of a surgeon. He ran away from home at the age of 16 and joined the army, just as France was getting into the American War of Independence. And in October 1779, he was there at the bloody fiasco that was the joint French-American attack on Savannah, which we talked about back in episode 2.10, Turning South. He spent the remainder of his war service in the West Indies before being discharged in 1784. After that, he set himself up as a dry goods merchant, got married in 1788, and appeared all set to live a life of peaceful obscurity.

[(16:57)](#!):

But then, along comes the French Revolution. He joined his local National Guard unit, and then when Paris started begging for volunteers to help fill the ranks of the rapidly deteriorating French army, Jourdan enlisted. He was put in charge of a battalion, fought at Gemapp and Nervenden, and quickly made a name for himself as an excellent young officer.

[(17:20)](#!):

After the defection of Dumourier and the subsequent cycle of generals who came and went in rapid fire, Jourdan was promoted to brigadier general in May, divisional general in July, and then when Uchar was arrested in September, 31-year-old Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was given command of the Army of the North, and I’m sure he was just thrilled about it. And as if being made commander of the Army of the North wasn’t bad enough, what with the representatives on mission ready to arrest you for treason if you cracked your knuckles too loud, Jourdan was about to have to labor under the biggest representative on mission of them all, Lazare Carnot himself.

[(17:60)](#!):

After successfully capturing La Quinoa, the Austrians then moved on to besiege the city of Mob\xc3\xa8ge, and with the British off licking their wounds, this was a perfect opportunity to strike at the Austrians while they were unsupported by their allies. So Carnot headed out from Paris to make sure that Jourdan did not hesitate.

[(18:20)](#!):

Now at first, there was nothing but agreement between the two men. Jourdan favored an aggressive campaign, and he commended the representatives on mission for the job they were doing. So Jourdan is saying all the right things. Then after regrouping following the actions at Dunkirk, the French were able to mass about 45,000 south of Mob\xc3\xa8ge to strike at the 20,000 or so Allied forces arrayed to cover the siege. Though this is all about to go really well for the French, Jourdan and Carnot will emerge with different versions of why it went really well. And so, despite their successful collaboration, both will emerge not particularly well-disposed towards the other.

[(19:02)](#!):

On October the 15th, the French attacked the entrenched Allies, but rather than using their almost two-to-one advantage to press on one spot and overwhelm the enemy, the French tried to execute a double-flanking envelopment with a strong push up the middle, a maneuver that appears to have been devised by Carnot. By spreading their forces thin, they were held off on all fronts, and the attack failed. So the next day, Carnot and Jourdan rethought their approach, and decided to concentrate their efforts on the planes on the right side of the line, centered most especially around the town of Watan\xc3\xa9.

[(19:39)](#!):

Jourdan’s version is that this was all his idea, and he basically had to disobey Carnot’s orders to concentrate his attack on that spot and win the battle. Meanwhile Carnot reported that as an engineer and an artilleryman, it was he who recognized the vulnerability of Watan\xc3\xa9 and ordered all the French to attack the position. Whoever ordered the attack, though, it was successful. The Allies were pushed off the plateau, the covering force was driven into retreat, and the Austrians were forced to lift the siege of Mobeige.

[(20:10)](#!):

The victory at the Battle of Watan\xc3\xa9 basically ended the campaign season of 1793 in the north. After spending the year getting beat and beat again, and watching their generals defect, get killed in battle, or be executed for treason, the French army amazingly is now heading into winter quarters with the momentum once again on their side. Momentum that is going to help give the Committee of Public Safety back in Paris the legitimacy it needs to complete its consolidation of power, a process we’re going to talk more about next week.

[(20:46)](#!):

A similar momentum shift that would also help bolster the Committee’s legitimacy was also underway in the west, where the Vaud\xc3\xa9 Uprising is about to peak and then begin its process of slow and bloody disintegration.

[(20:60)](#!):

Now the first thing I’ll mention about the war in the Vaud\xc3\xa9 is that it was as dangerous to be a revolutionary general in the west as it was to be a revolutionary general up in the north. I would hate for you to think that it was just the commanders of the Army of the North who were getting killed for their failures. For example, after the city of Sommier fell to the rebels, which we talked about two episodes back, the victorious leaders of the Catholic and Royal Army offered asylum to the defeated and captured Republican commander, but the commander was afraid that if he accepted the asylum that the angry Jacobins back in Paris would go after his family, so he rejoined his beaten troops and, as expected, was ordered back to Paris to explain his defeat, and when he did not do so to their satisfaction, he was condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal and would be executed in March 1794.

[(21:52)](#!):

After that guy was called back, a guy named Francois-Joseph Vestermann was dispatched down to replace him. Now Vestermann’s revolutionary career is pretty interesting, and it was a running case of she loves me, she loves me not. He had served in the Army of the Ancien Regime as a young man in the 1770s, but it didn’t stick, and he quickly left the service. After the revolution started up, he was bumming around Paris, and he fell in with Danton and the Cordelier Club, and as those guys got together to plan the insurrection of August 10th, Vestermann was the only one with any kind of professional military experience, so he was actually like the key architect of the attack on the Tuileries Palace, which I think is what buys him a little bit of credibility with the various revolutionary tribunals. But after that, he joined General Dumourier’s staff, and then when Dumourier defected, Vestermann was suspected of being an accomplice. Denounced by Jean-Paul Marat himself, Vestermann was recalled to Paris to make an account of himself, which he convincingly did, probably with a little help from Danton.

[(23:01)](#!):

So instead of getting his head cut off, they made him a brigadier general, and said, please go stamp out the Vaudet uprising. Now the situation in the Vaudet after Vestermann arrived is going to become very confusing, with a lot of moving parts, so at the risk of oversimplifying things, I’m going to oversimplify things.

[(23:22)](#!):

When Vestermann showed up in late June, the Catholic and Royal Army was bogged down in the ultimately failed siege of Nantes, so Vestermann was able to take 6,000 men and push his way to Chatillon, which was acting as a sort of rebel capital. He wasn’t able to hold it, though, because once the siege of Nantes got called off, 25,000 men from the Catholic and Royal Army arrived unannounced at the gates of Chatillon, taking the Republican forces completely by surprise. Vestermann himself managed to escape with about 500 cavalry, but the rest of his men were captured, at least those who weren’t killed in the fighting.

[(23:59)](#!):

Now as I’ve mentioned, the war in the Vaudet was extremely bitter, and the victorious Vaudet army had no qualms about lining up and massacring captured Republicans. Of the 6,000 Vestermann had led into the city, 2,000 were either killed in the fighting or in the subsequent massacres. This is not a pretty war, and it’s not going to get any prettier. After this defeat, Vestermann was naturally ordered to come back and face the tribunal, but amazingly enough, he was acquitted a second time.

[(24:33)](#!):

Now the next few months saw scattered skirmishing just about everywhere, and then one good victory for the Blues when 10,000 Republicans faced 35,000 rebels at Luzon and somehow managed to win the battle. Then in September, the Republicans got a major injection of fresh energy when the men from Mainz showed up.

[(24:54)](#!):

The men from Mainz, numbering about 15,000, were the guys who had been stranded behind enemy lines back when General Kustina had been forced to retreat from the Rhine back in the spring. Cut off and without hope of relief, the Mainz garrison had finally surrendered in July. They were allowed to walk away free though on the condition that they did not rejoin the war, which was pretty much standard practice in the days before huge POW camps were a thing. So as they walked west away from the frontier, the Committee of Public Safety said, don’t stop walking until you get to the Vaudet.

[(25:30)](#!):

As a coherent and experienced fighting force, the Mainz garrison guys immediately became the best units the Republicans had.

[(25:40)](#!):

This injection of support though wasn’t enough on its own to save the day, and into September the momentum remained with the Catholic and Royal Army, a very nebulous army of men coming and going, often with their families in tow, and commanders working together to achieve some objective before going off their own separate ways. On September the 19th, they massed 40,000 outside Tifosges, which was being held by an equal number of Republicans. After the rebels launched an attack to retake the city though, the rebel infantry panicked in the middle of the fighting and tried to run away, but they ran smack dab into a solid wall of their womenfolk who said, what the hell are you doing here? Get back in there and win the battle. Suitably chastened, they turned back around and won the battle, pushing the Republicans out of the city.

[(26:31)](#!):

But after winning the victory at Tifosges, the rebel commanders disagreed about what to do next, although enough of them stuck together, they followed that up with another victory at Montagu a few days later, which naturally led the beaten Republican commander getting called back to Paris, where unlike Westermann, he would be convicted of being beaten by the enemy and fed to Madame La Guillotine in April 1794. But that was the high point for the rebels, and the momentum of the Catholic and Royal Army was finally broken just a few weeks later.

[(27:06)](#!):

With the Mainz garrison men as their backbone, the Republicans advanced about 25,000 men on nearly 40,000 rebels occupying the city of Chollet. But despite the numbers, the rebel generals knew that they were super short on ammunition and had no artillery on hand at all, so they withdrew to the north.

[(27:27)](#!):

Once out of town, the generals met in a contentious council. Some wanted to take the whole army north, cross the Loire River, and link up with the British. Others refused to abandon their homes and said, no, we should stay and fight. Others wanted some to go and some to stay. In the end, though, they finally agreed to stay and fight it out, and on the afternoon of October 17th, they marched down in three columns to try to take back the city of Chollet. But when the Republicans executed a successful flank on their right, the Vaudez soldiers thought it was a whole new army showing up, and they fled in panic. Meanwhile up the middle, the Republicans used the old hidden heavy gun trick to blast the incoming rebels at point-blank range, inflicting heavy casualties. And pretty soon, the call was going out among the rebels to retreat north to the Loire River, which marked the northern boundary of the Vaudez.

[(28:23)](#!):

The victorious Republican leaders in Chollet were now confident that they were about to win the war. All that was left to do was to go trap the remaining rebels against the Loire and smash them to bits. But that made them slow to get moving, and by the time they got up to the Loire, two days later, they discovered the rebel army had successfully ferried itself across the great river. So though the Battle of Chollet was a major turning point in the war, it did not end the war. It simply opened up a dangerous new phase, because now the rebel army was loose in Normandy, and almost certainly on its way north to link up with the British.

[(29:03)](#!):

But that next phase will have to wait until next week, because we need to finish up today with the Siege of Lyon, a siege that will set the stage for one of the major centers of the Reign of Terror, and give us a chance right now to introduce another one of our infamous members of the Committee of Public Safety, the wheelchair-bound Georges Coton.

[(29:25)](#!):

Georges Coton was born in central France in 1755. He was the son of a local notary, and followed in his father’s footsteps, studying law before becoming a notary himself. As the revolution approached, Coton started having problems with his legs, and it soon developed into full-blown paralysis, which doctors later diagnosed as a result of meningitis. Before too long, he was confined to a wheelchair.

[(29:53)](#!):

Once the revolution got going, Coton was a perfect example of that class of guys who were not prominent enough to get elected into the Estates General in 1789, but who then stayed home and made local names for themselves in the new revolutionary political environment. Coton was popular in the local salons, and despite his physical condition, he earned a reputation as one of the most forceful speakers of the whole revolution. He was eloquent, he was passionate, and he had a voice that carried for miles. So when the elections for the Legislative Assembly came around in 1791, Coton was elected.

[(30:32)](#!):

He sat on the left of the Legislative Assembly, became friendly with Robespierre, but he was never a full-blown radical. Indeed, he very nearly wound up getting lumped in with the Girondins after he was subsequently elected into the National Convention. On a visit up near the Belgian border to find some relief for his legs, he met General Dumouriez and came away very impressed, firmly believing that Dumouriez was essential to the revolutionary cause. And at that moment, the Girondins and Dumouriez were closely linked by their aggressive posture towards Austria.

[(31:07)](#!):

But any flirtation with the Girondins ended the minute they refused Coton a seat on the Constitutional Committee that they were busy packing full of their allies. Ticked off, Coton went fully over to the mountain. And all through the trial of King Louis, Coton was a tireless speaker against reprieves, against appeals, and against compromises of any kind. Needless to say, he voted death, no strings attached.

[(31:33)](#!):

These revolutionary credentials ultimately got him elected onto the Committee of Public Safety on May 30, just in time for the enrag\xc3\xa9e insurrection of May 31, June 2. Coton was the one who formally moved on June 2 that the Girondins be expelled from the Convention. When the Committee started getting reshuffled in July, Coton clearly aligned himself with Robespierre and Saint-Just, and the three of them all tended to agree on who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.

[(32:05)](#!):

When the Federalists inside Lyon refused to surrender, the Committee decided it needed one of its members to personally ensure they did not get away with defying Paris. And Coton was dispatched on mission. He spent most of September in his home department, which is about 70 miles west of Lyon, raising men, money, and supplies to successfully prosecute the siege. Then in early October, he finally made his way over to the intransigent second city of France.

[(32:35)](#!):

Lyon had been getting bombarded with cannons for two months now, and its fortifications were crumbling. On top of that, they were running out of supplies and did not have enough provisions to see them through the winter. So at noon on October 8, Lyon finally opened its gates.

[(32:53)](#!):

With Marseille already retaken and Bordeaux scrambling to try to get back on the right side of Paris, the surrender of Lyon meant that the only remaining Federalist holdout was now Toulon. Toulon will hold out until December, and as it holds out, it will help introduce to the stage a young artillery captain from Corsica, who will play a major role in finally taking the city down, and then play a major role in, you know, all of world history.

[(33:22)](#!):

But getting back to the fate of Lyon, a few days after the city capitulated, Coton received instructions from Paris on how to handle the defeated city. Instructions that seemed almost unbelievable. The decision had been made to make an example of Lyon, and the decree Coton was to implement ordered that, quote, every habitation of the rich shall be demolished. There shall remain only the homes of the poor. It also said that the name Lyon itself should be blotted from the map, and that, quote, the collection of houses left standing shall henceforth bear the name of the liberated city. And finally, that on the remains of the demolished parts of the city, a great column would be erected that would say, Lyon made war on liberty. Lyon is no more.

[(34:13)](#!):

Beyond these explicit orders to literally destroy the city of Lyon, it was understood that Coton would also immediately convene a tribunal, convict the Federalist traitors, and execute every last one of them.

[(34:27)](#!):

But Coton did not really have the bloodlust in him, and as he worked his way ever so slowly through the demolition project, he worked even slower on the executions. And after only a few days of work, he concluded that he was just not the right man for this job. He wrote back to his colleagues on the committee requesting that he be reassigned, and that they send somebody to replace him. And so they did. And that replacement turned out to be Jean-Marie Collot de Bois. One of the two guys put on the committee after the September 5 insurrection, and Collot, as it turned out, absolutely had the bloodlust in him. But we’re going to get into all of that next week. And what we’ll also get into next week is of course what’s happening back in Paris. Because October 1793 turns out to be a month of climaxes everywhere. With terror now the order of the day, and the prisons and the capital full of enemies of the revolution, it was finally time to start clearing them all out. And who better to start with than Queen Marie Antoinette?

## 3.34- Saturn\'s Children

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions, Episode 3.34, Saturn’s Children.

[(00:19)](#!):

On March the 13th, 1793, a few days after the first aborted attempt by the Enrag\xc3\xa9 agitators to purge the national convention of the Girondins delegates, one of those Girondins stood up to deliver a prophetic verdict on the direction of the Revolution. Now so far in the show, I have not mentioned Pierre Verneuil by name, because I think we can all agree that too many names spoils the broth. But he is widely considered to have been one of the greatest orators of the Revolution. He was one of the driving forces behind the push for war with Austria, his speeches helped topple the Funya ministry, and he was one of the most eloquent advocates of the appeal to the people during the trial of King Louis. For all of this, he was of course one of the 22 specifically named Girondins the Enrag\xc3\xa9 wanted purged from the convention. Denouncing the recent run of lawlessness and violence, which was clearly ushering in a new kind of tyranny that was as opposed to true liberty as the old tyranny of the Ancien regime, he famously warned, So, citizens, it must be feared that the Revolution, like Saturn, successively devouring its children will engender finally only despotism with the calamities that accompany it.

[(01:32)](#!):

And of course here we are six months later. The Committee of Public Safety is setting itself up as a joint dictatorship, and Verneuil himself is about to be led to the guillotine.

[(01:42)](#!):

But as much as Verneuil’s speech is often portrayed as a prophecy of things to come, it’s clear that he was speaking of a process that had been a part of the Revolution from the very beginning. And as we stand here now on the brink of the Reign of Terror, when the Revolution truly begins to gorge herself, it’s worth taking a moment to look back and recognize just how many had already been eaten. Remember back in episode 3.5 when the Assembly of Notables resisted Controller General Colon’s reform package and were hailed for standing up to royal tyranny? Yeah, well those guys have all been now driven into counter-revolutionary exile. Remember in episode 3.7 when the Councillors of the Parliament became the leaders in the fight for French liberty? Well then in episode 3.9 they came out against doubling the third and voting by head, so when the parlemans were unceremoniously abolished in 1790, no one shed a tear. Remember Jean-Joseph Meunier? He was a huge part of getting the Estates General called in episode 3.8, and then he went out and organized the Munnarssian coalition in episode 3.13 that dominated the early days of the national convention. And what happened to Meunier? He quit the National Assembly in disgust after the Women’s March on Versailles, and then had to sneak off to Switzerland after being branded a reactionary. Remember the liberal nobles of the society of 1789? Guys like Lafayette, Jean-Sylvain Bailly, and Talleyrand, who had done so much to get the revolution off the ground, and who held all the key ministerial positions in episode 3.16 and 3.17, which was right around the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.

[(03:17)](#!):

All those guys have now been forced into retirement or exile for being way too conservative. Bailly is about to get his head chopped off.

[(03:25)](#!):

And then along came the Funya in episode 3.20, the constitutional monarchist led by the triumvirate of Dupour and Lema\xc3\xaet and Barnov, who rose up after the flight to Varennes, and who finally completed the Constitution of 1791. They were all branded traitors after the insurrection of August 10th, Dupour and Lema\xc3\xaet have fled into exile, Barnov is currently sitting in a jail cell, and he too is about to get his head chopped off. And now here we are approaching the end of the Girondins, on whose behalf the Paris streets had stormed the royal apartments of the Tuileries Palace in episode 3.22. Less than a year later, those same streets are now demanding the Girondins be purged from the body politic.

[(04:05)](#!):

So when Verneuil gave his speech in March 1793, he was not speaking as an oracle divining the future, he was just reporting on the very obvious course of revolutionary history, where it had been, and where it was now obviously going.

[(04:23)](#!):

So when last we left Paris, the insurrection of September 5th had led directly to the final pieces of the reign of terror being put into place, most especially the Law of Suspects, which opened the door for basically anyone to denounce anyone else for any reason. Before the Law of Suspects was passed, there were maybe 1,500 people locked up in the various prisons of the capital. By December, that number will have shot up to 4,500, and this was a pattern that would repeat itself across France, and soon enough somewhere on the order of 500,000 people would find themselves in custody. And those numbers should tell you something though right away, something that’s worth keeping in mind when we get into the chilling efficiency of the guillotine. The reign of terror only has about 16,000 official victims, and those killed in Paris numbered only about 2,600. So as much as being arrested by the revolutionary authorities might feel like an immediate death sentence, most people who were arrested were either acquitted, and we’ll get to that in a second, or they languished in custody long enough to survive until the Termidorian Reaction. Now, those numbers don’t count the tens of thousands killed by things like the infernal columns or in random street murders, which still went on pretty regularly. But still, compared to the horrific 20th century political slaughters in like Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, and the Cambodian killing fields that consumed millions of people, the reign of terror turns out looking positively humane.

[(05:55)](#!):

But despite the relatively, relatively low conversion of arrests to executions, things were definitely getting more vigorous and more streamlined once terror became the order of the day. Prior to the insurrection of September the 5th, the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris actually operated with a degree of objectivity. For most of 1793, those trials were not, for the most part, show trials. You could get a lawyer to help you out, and you could even offer a defense, and if the defense was plausible, you would be acquitted. Everyone involved in the process took a certain amount of pride in making sure that they only killed the real enemies of France.

[(06:35)](#!):

Now of course, since we’ve been talking a lot about the routine executions of all those Revolutionary Generals, you may have thought that the terror has really already revved up to peak irrational bloodlust. But between March and September 1793, only 66 people were actually guillotined. The generals were just in a special class all their own. To maintain the legitimacy of the central revolutionary government, it was essential that the failure of the French armies in the field be pinned squarely on treasonous or deliberately negligent officers.

[(07:08)](#!):

It was politically impossible to say, oh well, our troops just aren’t really that good, because everyone was irreversibly committed to the propaganda that the sans-culottes citizen-soldier was just made of superior moral and military fiber. And you didn’t want to say, oh well, the guy we put in charge was incompetent, because someone then might ask, well, if he’s so incompetent, then why did you put him in charge? So better than to say that the general intentionally deceived us and committed treason and conspired with the enemy, and now we’re killing him for betraying the nation.

[(07:42)](#!):

So yes, if you were a failed general, the tribunal was absolutely going to smear your good name and then chop your head off. But aside from those guys, you actually did have a decent shot at surviving if you were denounced.

[(07:56)](#!):

Now of course, that very willingness to at least appear impartial was not going to fly in some quarters \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, those quarters that read the newspaper of Jacques Hebert. After Hebert became the voice of the people, he used that voice to hammer on those who were willing to indulge in moderation. And in fact, both those words were soon turned into political epithets, and not too long after that, it would be a crime all on its own to be an indulgent or a moderate. In his War on Moderation, there were two big questions that Hebert demanded answers to all through the summer of 1793. Why does Queen Marie Antoinette yet live when we know that she conspired with the Austrians to destroy us, and why do the Girondins yet live when we know that they were the architects of the Federalist uprising? The pounding rhetoric of Hebert was in fact one of the reasons Danton and his guys were bounced from the Committee of Public Safety, since Danton advocated hateful moderation \xe2\x80\x94 and specifically, keeping the Queen alive to use as a bargaining chip with the Allies.

[(09:02)](#!):

Now as you’ll recall, immediately after being tossed out of the convention, the prescribed Girondins had been placed under a loose house arrest, as if the authorities were a little sheepish about what they were doing. But then individual Girondins started trying to slip out of Paris, and the grip had to tighten up a little bit. But though Petillon and a few other guys did manage to escape up to Normandy, the others who tried to make good their escape \xe2\x80\x94 including Jacques-Pierre Brissot \xe2\x80\x94 were tracked down and reapprehended.

[(09:31)](#!):

After the insurrection of September the 5th, the authorities prepared to prosecute them all as a group, and in anticipation of their trial they were moved to the Conciergerie, the prison known around town as the Anti-Chamber of Death. On October 3rd, the Committee of General Security started presenting their formal indictments of the Girondins, and soon brought them all before the Revolutionary Tribunal.

[(09:55)](#!):

But though the trial of the Girondins was meant to be a preordained public demonstration of their collective guilt, the rules and procedures of the tribunal was still set up to function as an actual trial, and the Girondins were nothing if not razor-sharp lawyers and excellent public speakers. So they were able to deftly parry every prosecutorial thrust. In a big way, it was the eloquence and persuasiveness of the Girondins that induced the Committee of Public Safety to step in and say, no more of this objective rule of law, baloney. We know who’s guilty. From here on out, we’re going to bring the accused forward, announce the verdict, next case.

[(10:34)](#!):

And it would not be until after Thermidor that the accused would once again really have an opportunity to defend themselves. The prosecution went after the Girondins from a couple of different angles, and all those angles stalled out as the defendants started refuting the holy living hell out of all the charges.

[(10:53)](#!):

The biggest quagmire the prosecutors ran into was proving that the Girondins were in fact an organized faction. Now these were the days when party and faction were still considered subversive and anti-democratic. And as I mentioned when I first started talking about the Girondins and the Mountain, those are convenient labels that help us group people together. But once you start actually trying to prove that they are a close-knit party working towards a shared goal, it all kind of starts to fall apart, as the prosecutors soon discovered.

[(11:25)](#!):

One by one, the Girondins stood up and argued, look, I might be friends with these guys, but I did this when they all did that, and they all did that, well, I did this. And sure, we get together for drinks, but for crying out loud, I voted against the appeal to the people. And then the next guy would get up and make his own version of the same case. With the attempt to prove this group of individuals were actually a single-minded party going nowhere, the prosecution moved on to its two big accusations, one of which was preposterous, the other was at least plausible.

[(11:59)](#!):

The preposterous claim was that the Girondins had been closet royalists all along, and that they had spent all that time pushing for war against Austria because they wanted France to lose. Now this was of course utterly insane. Yes, the little round of secret negotiations with the king just before the insurrection of August the 10th didn’t look good, but accusing them of being crypto-royalists? That is nuts. Most of them were early and honest Republicans.

[(12:29)](#!):

And the idea that the war with Austria was about intentionally getting France into a war it couldn’t win? Briseau wanted that war because he was willfully blind to the weakness of the French army, not because he wanted to exploit that weakness on behalf of the king. But the charge that was far more believable was that the Girondins had orchestrated the Federalist insurrection, and had intentionally tried to divide the Republic from itself.

[(12:55)](#!):

Rather than getting bogged down in the other accusations, I think that this is really where the prosecutors should have focused all their attention. The Girondins were on the record asking for armed troops from the provinces to come occupy Paris. They had made threats about literally wiping the capital off the map. The few of them who had successfully escaped after the purge had put themselves at the head of armed Federalists and declared against the convention. You focus on that one line, and I think this trial wraps up in a much neater package. But by introducing the other patently absurd charges, the prosecutors gave the Girondins the opportunity to make incredulous and thoroughly persuasive rebuttals.

[(13:36)](#!):

By the middle of October, the trial was dragging on, and nailing down an irrefutable conviction was looking dicey. Just as the trial of the Girondins was getting going, the Committee of Public Safety made another move in the direction of just wholesale abandoning the rule of law.

[(13:53)](#!):

On October the 10th, a motion was passed through the convention permanently suspending the Constitution of 1793. The government of France would now be, quote, revolutionary until the peace. And by revolutionary, they meant the opposite of constitutional government. Basically, the nation was now officially being run by an emergency government until the war was won and France was safe.

[(14:20)](#!):

The Committee of Public Safety was then further led to believe that their emergency powers could not be abandoned when Fabre de Glantina approached Robespierre and St. Just and requested an audience with them and representatives of the Committee of General Security. Now, de Glantina, you might remember, was one of the old Cordell Yee Club guys and an intimate of Danton and Desmoulas. Well, I hinted once upon a time that Danton would come to regret letting de Glantina rise to power with him. And it’s right about now that the regret is going to start sinking in. Well, not quite yet. De Glantina is still playing his hand pretty well.

[(15:00)](#!):

On October the 12th, he met with Robespierre and St. Just and the Committee of General Security and proceeded to lay out the details of what has since been dubbed the foreign plot, an intertwined conspiracy of treasonous Frenchmen and foreign agents in Paris working to undermine the revolution. Mostly with money provided by the British.

[(15:22)](#!):

As we’ve seen, the revolutionaries were always susceptible to a good conspiracy theory, and paranoia had become something of a default position. When de Glantina laid all this out, Robespierre appears to have swallowed the whole thing hook, line, and sinker, especially the part about an agent of the foreign plot working inside the Committee of Public Safety itself. Robespierre had always been concerned about the Committee being infiltrated, and so it might have even come as something of a relief that he finally had a real suspect, and a plausible suspect at that, Marie-Jean Herault de Saussure.

[(15:59)](#!):

Herault was already a suspicious character, and it’s somewhat surprising that he was even still on the Committee of Public Safety, being as he was of noble blood.

[(16:10)](#!):

Born in 1759, Herault managed to secure an appointment as a king’s advocate at the age of 20, that being the same job Danton would hold down before the revolution. Like many of his noble brethren, Herault was a man of the liberal enlightenment, and he was well-prepared to join the revolution once it got going. He was not elected to the Estates General, but he was appointed a judge in Paris when the legal reforms started kicking in. Then he was sent on the first of many missions to Alsace to keep the border territories from resisting the revolution, or worse yet, trying to break away completely. He was elected into the Legislative Assembly in 1791 and sat on the far left, and was by now a close working associate of Georges Danton. Appointed to the diplomatic committee, he continued to mostly serve the government on missions to the frontier departments, all of which in retrospect would make him look like the perfect candidate for an alleged foreign plot, which is probably why Deglantina pointed at him. But still, his revolutionary credentials were pretty impeccable. He helped organize the insurrection of August the 10th, and though he was absent from Paris for the trial of the king, he made no secret that he supported death with no appeal. With his strong background in law, he was appointed by the convention to serve on the Constitutional Committee alongside Saint-Just, which is how Herault winds up on the Committee of Public Safety. Once there, he became something like de facto foreign minister, handling almost all the committee’s diplomatic business.

[(17:43)](#!):

Now other than his frequent dealings with foreigners, which is pretty unavoidable if you’re the de facto foreign minister, it was easy for Robespierre to suspect Herault. Because unlike the more deadly serious revolutionaries like, oh say, Robespierre, you kinda get the feeling that Herault thought this was all a great game. He was a cultivated and well-dressed dandy. He was a noble. He was quick-witted and quick to make a little sarcastic joke, even at his own expense. He cast a cynical eye on the world and found it full of ironies and opportunities for pleasure. So needless to say, he was not an austere true believer. So when Deglantina said Herault was now selling secrets to the Austrians and his advocacy for even more aggressive war was a two-faced attempt to lead France into some kind of trap, Robespierre was absolutely ready to believe it. But Herault had too many friends to make any move on him just yet. So for the moment, Robespierre elected to bide his time.

[(18:46)](#!):

In addition to giving Robespierre an inner circle member of the Committee of Public Safety to keep an eye on, what Deglantina’s foreign plot did was really start to help Robespierre narrow the definition of politically acceptable behavior. Those too far to the left or too far to the right were obviously just working with enemies of France to destroy or discredit the revolution.

[(19:09)](#!):

Robespierre began formulating this guiding rubric that classified some men as being cis revolutionaries who felt unacceptably short to perfection, most prominent among those being the Girondins, and then he classified other men as ultra-revolutionaries. Men like Jacques Hebert, who went unacceptably too far beyond perfection. The ultras were likely in the pay of foreign enemies, and the tactics they adopted and the programs they advocated were clearly meant to do nothing but bring the revolution into disrepute and fatally weaken its legitimacy. So what is the thing in the middle that you were either falling short of or going too far beyond? Basically Robespierre himself.

[(19:53)](#!):

He considered himself the standard by which everyone else would be measured. And that is why it’s about to get very bad for everyone else. But before we move on, you do have to know that the foreign plot was completely made up. A fiction conjured out of thin air by Deglantina.

[(20:12)](#!):

Why? Well, as we’ll discuss when I come back from my break, Deglantina is just corrupt as all get-out, and he had been using the levers of revolutionary government to extort money from everyone he thought he could strong-arm into paying. Realizing that his shenanigans were about to come out into the open, he concocted an elaborate story that implicated all his enemies. By beating them to the denunciation punch, he was able to insulate himself from their very real accusations against him, because it would just look like they were attacking him to save themselves. And this would work for a while too. But not forever. And also, just so you know before he goes down, Deglantina will make one other major contribution to the revolution which we’ll be talking about next week, in the first of a series of supplementals I’ve cooked up to keep you busy while I’m off on the tours.

[(21:03)](#!):

Now as the myth of the foreign plot began to seep its way into the political firmament, and as the Revolutionary Tribunal continued to struggle with the Girondins, there was another matter everyone could turn their attention to who would give them a nice outlet for their fear without anyone getting up in arms about totally ditching the rule of law. It was time to bring Queen Marie Antoinette, now dubbed the Widow Capet, to justice. As is the execution of Louis back in January, the Queen and the rest of the royal family had remained in the temple.

[(21:37)](#!):

Though they were not treated terribly just yet, there was nothing comfortable or comforting about their captivity, and they were closely monitored day and night. But if the Queen was hoping to make it through all of this in one piece, she did very little to earn the sympathy of her captors, as she pointedly treated her eight-year-old son as if he was now King Louis XVII, doing stuff like insisting that the boy be served first at meals and teaching him his place in the great royal hierarchy.

[(22:07)](#!):

But at this point, I think the Queen could probably see this all coming to an end two possible ways. Either the Revolution would ultimately collapse from the dual pressure of civil war at home and invasion from abroad, in which case keeping the royal candle burning was essential to maintaining the continuity of an eventually restored monarchy. And if the Revolution didn’t collapse, they were probably all going to be killed anyway, so there’s no sense in doing anything but going out an unrepentant martyr.

[(22:35)](#!):

But this posture did her son no favors, and so on the night of July III, Louis XVII was removed from his mother’s care and handed over to a semi-literate cobbler who was ordered to raise the boy as a proper Republican. About a week after her son was taken, Danton got the boot from the Committee of Public Safety, and the conditions of the Queen’s captivity got considerably worse. On August 1st, she was rousted in the middle of the night and moved down to the conciergerie. She was watched over day and night in a tiny little cell and given exactly zero privacy.

[(23:11)](#!):

Over the next few months, her health began to understandably deteriorate. Meanwhile out in the streets, Jacques Hebert continued to beat the drum to have her killed, calling her the Austrian she-wolf and the arch-tigress who has been at the heart of every terrible thing that has befallen France since she first showed up as an awkward teenage girl back in 1770. In many ways, Hebert turned her into this sort of woman of blood, though I don’t believe it was ever specifically formulated in that way, and she needed to die for France to be purified. Once the insurrection of September 5th came and went, the only question was how long until the Queen was executed.

[(23:51)](#!):

They finally called her to the Revolutionary Tribunal on October 14th, and as I hinted, she wasn’t even given the appearance of a real trial. She wasn’t even afforded the superficial trappings that the Convention had granted her husband, like, say, a lawyer. And what’s kind of funny is that a lot of the stuff they accused her of was stuff that they had already convicted her husband of. Remember that business when the Swiss guards showed up at Versailles in 1789 and in the ensuing welcome party they trampled the Cockade? Well having already pinned this affront on the King, the story was now that the Queen was the one who was really behind it. And that veto of the anti-clerical law, well Louis was now presented as a dupe being controlled by his evil wife who was really behind it. They also accused her of plotting to kill the Duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, which is a bit rich since Orl\xc3\xa9ans himself is already imprisoned and will be convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed three weeks down the road. And FYI, the Duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans is the focus of one of those little supplementals I’ve recorded. Now most of the charges against her were just run-of-the-mill character assassination stuff, to prove that the Queen needed to die not necessarily for what she had done, but because of who she was. But before you start feeling too sorry for her, as with her husband, the charges against her were sometimes way off base, but other times pretty right on the money. She had absolutely helped organize the flight to Varennes with the intention of escaping France and linking up with the Austrian army.

[(25:25)](#!):

The Tribunal had in hand all of her correspondence with the Austrian court, which unequivocally proved that she was not just inviting a foreign army to invade France, but had been positively begging them to do it. And that’s treason. But the prosecutors wouldn’t just let that obvious charge stand on its own. And so they stooped very low, and brought her son out to testify against her.

[(25:49)](#!):

At the pressing of Hebert, the boy had been coached, I’m sure quite violently, to testify that his mother had sexually abused him. Now the Queen knew she was doomed, and that it was important to maintain stoic calm in the face of all this abuse, but this was beyond the pale, and she angrily admonished her accusers for asking her to respond to such a crime against nature. And apparently the women in the audience, good revolutionaries all who wanted to see the Austrian she-wolf dead, started making angry noises in the gallery that the prosecution had jumped way over the line.

[(26:26)](#!):

But this last-minute bit of sympathy was not even close to being enough to save Marie Antoinette. On October 16, she was convicted of treason and sentenced to death.

[(26:36)](#!):

She held out a bit of hope that she might be granted something resembling the dignity allowed her husband on the day of his execution, but no such luck. She was forced to give her final confession to a patriotic civic priest, rather than a clergyman recognized by Rome. Then, unlike her husband, who had been taken to the scaffold in a closed carriage, the Queen was loaded onto the back of an open tumbrel, just like a common criminal. As she rode, hands bound behind her back, Jacques-Louis David dashed off a famous sketch of an unhappy woman who yet kept her back straight and her head held high.

[(27:12)](#!):

When she was led up onto the scaffold and towards the guillotine, her last words were allegedly, Pardon me, sir. I meant not to do it. When she accidentally stepped on the executioner’s toes. Then they laid her down and zip, thud, the end. Her body was then dumped into the same mass grave they had dumped her husband into. After the restoration, what remained of the royal couple was exhumed. In the king’s case, there was really nothing left, since the revolutionaries had covered his body with a double dose of lye to make sure it would fully disintegrate. But the agents of the restoration did move what was left to the Basilica Sandeni, where they remained to this day.

[(27:56)](#!):

After dispensing with the queen, the Revolutionary Tribunal returned to the Girondins, who just kept making a nuisance of themselves by refuting point-by-point every charge levied against them. If this kept up, they might actually wriggle away from the hand of revolutionary justice. So on October 29, the Committee of Public Safety issued a fateful decree. From now on, trials would have a time limit.

[(28:21)](#!):

If after three days enough evidence had been submitted to establish guilt, then that was it. End of trial. There was no sense in letting the enemies of France spin endless sophistries to explain away their guilt. So in accordance with this new decree, the trial of the Girondins was cut off on October 30. The jury has heard quite enough, thank you very much. When the final verdict was read out \xe2\x80\x94 guilty, on all counts, of course \xe2\x80\x94 the Girondins acted each in his own way, some rising to their feet to furiously denounce the entire proceedings.

[(28:55)](#!):

Briseau allegedly just slumped down in his chair. Another guy fell right out of his chair, and people in the audience thought that he had like fainted or something, until they rolled him over and discovered he had smuggled a knife in and had just committed suicide. But don’t worry, they’ll load his corpse into the guillotine and cut his head off anyway. After spending a final night together in the conciergery, the 22 Girondins were loaded onto the tumbrel the next morning. The great orator Vernier, who had of course prophesized all this, considered ingesting some poison that he had kept at hand just in case, but he decided to go out with his friends instead.

[(29:33)](#!):

In the tumbrel, on the way to the scaffold, they all sang La Marseillaise together. Where Marie Antoinette had kept her head held high as a martyr for the monarchy, the Girondins kept their heads held high as martyrs for the revolution. They knew they were patriots, they knew this was unjust, and that history would vindicate them. The guillotine then dispatched them one by one, 22 heads in 36 minutes. When the revolution devours her children, she devours them quickly.

[(30:06)](#!):

So we’re going to leave it off there for now. As I’ve mentioned a few times, I am about to embark on the next round of revolution tours, and I’ll be spending the next three weeks in England and France, and then Boston and Philadelphia. We will officially return to our main story on May 17th, when we get into the Law of 14 Free Mayor and the Committee of Public Safety’s final consolidation of power. In the meantime, I have written and recorded three supplemental episodes to tide you over. The first will be about the new Republican calendar, which is just now, in October 1793, being adopted, and that will help explain to you what 14 Free Mayor even means. The second one will be about the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans, who is still occasionally accused of being the puppet master behind the early days of the revolution. And then the third supplemental will be a highly entertaining side trip across the Atlantic, where we will watch George Washington get driven absolutely nuts by Citizen Genet, the French Revolution’s ambassador to the United States. Meanwhile, I will be off on a grand adventure that you really should join me for the next time we do it.

## 3.34a- The Republican Calendar

 [(00:00)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.34a, the Republican Calendar.

[(00:19)](#!):

So greetings from the past. By the time this episode goes live, I think I will be in London. Did you guys know that gentleman Johnny Burgoyne is buried in Westminster Abbey? If I’ve played my cards right, then I was there yesterday and should have already taken a picture of me with my gentleman Johnny t-shirt standing next to his marker. And we’ll see if the hotel Wi-Fi lets me upload a picture of that along with the episode. Anyway, we are here today to talk about the famous French Republican Calendar, the attempt by the revolutionaries to completely reinvent how humans mark the passage of time. When you head out there into the world, you might find people calling it the French Revolutionary Calendar, but as we’ll see in a second, that is actually a misnomer, and for a very particular reason. But if you accidentally call it the French Revolutionary Calendar, don’t beat yourself up. And if you hear somebody call it the French Revolutionary Calendar, don’t beat them up. It’s no big deal. And nobody likes a pedant.

[(01:14)](#!):

After the fall of the Bastille in July 1789, patriotic revolutionaries took to informally calling it the Dawn of the Era of Liberty, and often specifically referring to 1789 as Year One of the Age of Liberty. But this was all merely poetic expression. As the revolution progressed, however, more and more stuff started happening, and more and more things started getting reformed, time itself did finally come under scrutiny. As you may know, space came under scrutiny as well, which is where the meter comes from, but that’s a story for another day, because we’re here to talk about revolutionary time, not revolutionary space.

[(01:54)](#!):

The urge to remake the markers of time really came from two main currents. First, Enlightenment science and its desperate obsession with rationalizing everything. And then second, anti-clerical radicals who wanted to abolish any lingering sway held by the Catholic Church on the good citizens and citizenesses of France. After the insurrection of August the 10th, which seemed to have finally truly swept aside the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, the movement to remake the calendar went from interesting conversation in the salons to actual working commission of the National Convention.

[(02:29)](#!):

Now just to get this out of the way, technically, the National Convention rushed ahead on this, and just as they were abolishing the monarchy in September 1792, they also declared 1792 year one of the French Republic, and ordered all public documents to be so dated. But it was only public documents that were so dated, and it’s unclear just how widespread the practice was.

[(02:51)](#!):

Plus, there was some disagreement about when exactly the year should start, and whether the rest of the calendar should be capped, or whether a whole new system should be devised. So the convention appointed a commission to make a recommendation. This commission was chaired by Charles Gibert Rome, who was by disposition a mathematician, but who had also become a prominent national politician since being elected into the legislative assembly in 1791. Rome gathered up a collection of men to help study the issue and make a recommendation, and though the majority of the men he consulted were all Enlightenment science nerds, mostly astronomers, chemists, geographers, and mathematicians, there were also a few appointees from the more liberal arts side of the world, the most prominent being poet, playwright, and spinner of fictitious foreign plots, Fabre de Glantina.

[(03:42)](#!):

The first major question that presented itself was, are we going to craft a revolutionary calendar or a republican calendar? If it was the former, then obviously 1789 is year one, and we are currently in year \xe2\x80\xa6 well, wait a minute. Are we in year four, or have we moved into year five? If we say year one was 1789, do we mean starting January 1, 1789, or like July 14, 1789?

[(04:09)](#!):

But luckily we don’t have to linger on that particular debate, because the commission soon decided it wasn’t going to be a revolutionary calendar, it was going to be a republican calendar, and they decided to fix the beginning of the new year one at the moment the monarchy was abolished on September 22, 1792. But because the commission was full of science nerds, they couldn’t just leave it at the anniversary of the abolition of the monarchy. They said, hey look, that just so happens to coincide with the autumnal equinox, so we’ll say that the year starts at midnight on the day of the autumnal equinox. Which leads to some weirdness, because the autumnal equinox floats around a little bit. So like, in 1795, the first day of the republican year would actually correspond to September the 23rd, and in 1803 it would actually correspond to September the 24th. This will lead to all kinds of weird conversion problems for historians, but let’s not get into it right now.

[(05:06)](#!):

Setting aside the scientific problem of when to start the calendar, we can certainly say that poetically and politically it begins at the dawn of the republic. After that, each republican year would be divided into 12 months, same as before. Now for a bunch of guys who were utterly obsessed with the number 10, I find it interesting that they didn’t go with a 10-month year, but that would have obviously run into a couple of other problems. For one thing, these guys were super hot on the idea of a 10-day week, and there’s not really any good way to make the math work if you’re trying to cram 10-day weeks into 36-day months. The other thing is that these guys were all natural scientists and recognized that the year was divided into four distinct seasons, partitioned by the equinoxes and the solstices.

[(05:53)](#!):

So they kept the 12-month year, each month being divided into three 10-day weeks, for a total of 30 days each. But wait, you say, that’s only 360 days. What about the other five days? And what do you do with leap years? Hold your horses, we’ll get to it.

[(06:09)](#!):

Now one of the big impetuses for the calendar, as I said, was the desire to break the long ingrained Catholic habits of the French people. Most especially, the every seven days is a Sunday, and that is our day of rest. That seven-day rhythm would keep the people of France rooted in superstition. So the calendar tried to break the habit, which is why they were more interested in a 10-day week than a 10-month year. And in case you’re wondering what the single least popular aspect of the Republican calendar was, well here you go. Because good luck getting the peasants not to resent the heck out of you telling them that they get a day off now every 10 days, rather than every seven days.

[(06:49)](#!):

Getting deeper into the decimalization of everything, the new Republican day would be divided into 10 hours, and each hour would be divided into 100 minutes, and each minute would be divided into 100 seconds, and so on into infinity. A Republican hour was thus 144 old-style minutes, and a Republican minute was 86.4 old-style minutes. Now, if all of this seems like a really difficult thing to actually implement, you are right. And though it was all mandated, no one really tried to enforce it, and it would be quietly dropped in 1795. There was, however, a little time where watches were manufactured on this decimal-time system. And you can see some of them on display at the Museum of Arts and Crafts in Paris, though I don’t think that translation is really right, I think it’s more like the Museum of Science and Industry.

[(07:41)](#!):

Anyway I am going to try to pop in and go check some out when I’m in Paris. No one bought them though, except for French revolutionary science nerds, so there aren’t actually that many of them left.

[(07:51)](#!):

Okay, so we’ve got our 12 months, each divided into three weeks of 10 days each. But our science nerds on the committee forgot that they were handing this off to real people who would actually have to use it in the real world. So dating things the first day of the third decade of the seventh month of year two might be accurate, but it was clunky as hell. So that’s when Fabre de Glantina steps into the picture and makes his other great contribution to the French Revolution. De Glantina said, let’s give this cold math a little bit of romance. So he set his imagination to work on a naming scheme for all the months.

[(08:30)](#!):

Now since the calendar was built around the natural rhythms of the year, De Glantina used that as the basis for his new naming scheme. The months would be grouped by season and given names to invoke a relevant aspect of that season. Since the calendar starts with the autumnal equinox, the first three months of the year are the autumn months, starting with Vendimere for the grape harvest, then Pr\xc3\xa9mer for fog, Fr\xc3\xa9mer for frost. And just so you know, De Glantina is making these words up by mashing together Greek or Latin with French to get something that just kind of sounded cool. Okay, so moving on to winter, you have Nivos for snow, Pluvios for rain, and Ventos for wind. I’m probably butchering the pronunciation of all these, but what can you do? Then in the spring is Germinal for germination, Florial for flower, and Prairial for pasture. And then finally in the summer you get Messidor for harvest, Thermidor for heat, and Fructidor for fruit.

[(09:34)](#!):

But wait, there’s more. Though they ultimately kept the names of the days simply first day, second day, third day, etc., De Glantina decided to riff on the old Catholic idea where every day of the year has a designated saint. So in keeping with the natural pastoral romance of his naming scheme, De Glantina decided to use designated days to celebrate the wonders of agriculture. Every day was assigned a different object of reflection or contemplation. Most of these objects of reflection were vegetables or plants, you know, apple, spinach, rose. The only exception was the month of Nivos, the first month of winter corresponding roughly with January. In that month, the plants were replaced by minerals, so like flint and granite, things like that. But interspersed with all these plants were two other classes of objects. Every fifth day of the week was reserved for a common animal like a dog or a pig or a goose. And then the tenth days were always dedicated to an agricultural tool like the plow or the cart or the pitchfork. And I’m not sure if this was on purpose, but there’s something kind of obnoxious about reserving the day of rest for a work tool. I mean, you finally get a day where you don’t have to plow anything, and Fabra De Glantina wants you to sit around contemplating your plow. That just doesn’t seem right.

[(10:60)](#!):

So now we can finally get back around to those extra five days at the end of the year, since 12 times 30 only equals 360, not 365. Those extra days were originally called simply complementary days. But the poetic De Glantina said no, we will call them the sanculotides, because what’s a little naked political pandering between friends? Each day of the sanculotide would be dedicated to a different trait worthy of admiration. So the first complementary day would be given over to genius or talent, depending on the translation, and celebrate the great inventions or innovations of the year. The second day would be for labor, celebrate industry and production. The third day would be to policy, to celebrate all the best laws and decrees that the people had found most beneficial over the previous year. The fourth would be for honors or rewards, where the best exemplars of the previous three days’ aspects would get like blue ribbons and stuff for their good work. The fifth day would be given over to opinion or conviction, which De Glantina thought would be a day you could get together and criticize the government, make fun of leaders, ironically mock whatever you liked with perfect freedom from punishment. And this fifth day of the sanculotide should tell you just about everything you need to know about how far civil rights have fallen on the revolution’s list of priorities. Because in a nation that respects freedom of speech, you don’t really need a special day where you can criticize the government without fear of reprisal.

[(12:34)](#!):

Anyway, on designated leap years, there would be a sixth complimentary day dedicated to celebrating the revolution itself. Now after De Glantina presented this list of festivals, the incorruptible Robespierre made what he considered an essential alteration. The day of policy would be removed in favor of a day celebrating virtue. And virtue would be celebrated on the first day. When De Glantina protested a bit, Robespierre said virtue is more important than genius. Was not Cato a better man than Caesar? And random editorializing from the guy who brought you the history of Rome, I’m not really sure Cato was a better man than Caesar.

[(13:16)](#!):

The French Republican calendar was introduced to the convention on September the 23rd, 1793, and officially sanctioned by the national convention on October the 24th. It would be in effect until Napoleon finally abolished it in 1805, aka year 14, as a part of his wide-ranging program to reconcile the old ways with the new ways. The period when the calendar is in effect, of course, causes all kinds of headaches for students, because from here on out, all the important dates in the history of the French Revolution will reference the Republican calendar. That’s why it’s called the Termidorian Reaction, and the coup of 18 Fructidor, and the coup of 30 Prairiel, and the coup of 18 Brumaire. FYI, there’s a lot of coups coming up. But just so you know, I am not going to start using the new calendar to do anything but point out why some event gets its name. So when Fabre De Glantina, for example, gets hauled off to the guillotine, I’ll still say that he dies April the 5th, 1794. But when Robespierre gets his face blown off, I’ll tell you that it happened on July the 27th, 1794, but I’ll also make sure to mention that it happened on 9 Thermidor year 2, because that’s how the event gets referenced in a lot of history books out there. And that’s where it gets its name, the Termidorian Reaction.

[(14:39)](#!):

Okay, so that does it for the Republican calendar, and hopefully you now have a better idea of why things are going to be called what they will be called. And I will see you all next week, which according to that calendar, would be the 5th of Florial year 223, for a brief look back on the life and career of alleged revolutionary puppet master Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9.

Episode 3.34b \xe2\x80\x93 Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 As I mentioned back in episode 3.25, the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans, the renegade Prince of the Blood who was now styling himself Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9, deserves more attention than I have been able to give him. Since he is about to get his head chopped off, I figured that now would be the perfect time to try to correct this oversight. So without further ado, let’s hop in the wayback machine and head back into the days of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, because the story of the coming of the French Revolution is absolutely not complete without explaining the part played by the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans.

[(03:01)](#!):

Young Louis-Philippe Joseph d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans was born in 1747 into the House of Orl\xc3\xa9ans, the senior cadet branch of the Royal House of Bourbon. His grandfather was Philippe d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, a younger brother of King Louis XIV, and it was to him that both the family name and their cadet branch status trace back to.

[(03:22)](#!):

The Orl\xc3\xa9ans branch, being so close to the immediate royal family but just outside of it, earned their senior male patriarchs the distinction of being the first Prince of the Blood, an official court position reserved for the most senior royal prince not in the king’s immediate family. What this meant in practice was that if all the inner circle bourbons were to die out, the throne would pass to the House of Orl\xc3\xa9ans, and that is going to be important.

[(03:52)](#!):

When Louis-Philippe was 22, he married one of his cousins Louisa Marie, who happened to be the daughter of an insanely wealthy duke, who himself happened to be the son of one of King Louis XIV’s legitimized illegitimate children, if you can follow along with that. So Louisa Marie’s dowry combined with the already huge estates of the House of Orl\xc3\xa9ans meant that when Louis-Philippe inherited the title duked Orl\xc3\xa9ans from his father, he became one of the richest men in France. This is also going to be important.

[(04:24)](#!):

From very early on, Louis-Philippe cultivated an antagonistic edge in his dealings with the king’s immediate royal family. He first ran afoul of them in the early 1770s, when Lord Chancellor Maupou made his play Shutting Down the Parlement, which we talked about way back in episode 3.3.

[(04:41)](#!):

While Louis-Philippe, not yet duked Orl\xc3\xa9ans, set himself up as a champion and patron of the parlement. For this, he earned popular acclaim and the enmity of the king’s ministry, and a lettre de cachet was issued exiling him from Paris. Not the last time that would happen. He kept up his tweaking of the bourbons after Louis XVI ascended to the throne, and it took no time at all for Louis-Philippe and Marie Antoinette to come to utterly despise each other. When his father died in 1785, Louis-Philippe became the duke d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, and first prince of the blood, which rankled the king’s inner circle to no end.

[(05:22)](#!):

He also inherited the Palais Royale, a huge palace just a few blocks from the Tuileries in Paris. One of the subtle little quirks of ancien r\xc3\xa9gime law was that royal residences, like the Palais Royale, were not subject to official censorship laws. So when Orl\xc3\xa9ans inherited the property, he threw its doors open to the public and basically created a safe space to print and distribute material that might otherwise run afoul of the censors. The arcades of the Palais were soon brimming with shops and cafes and books, pamphlets and newspapers that advocated all kinds of crazy stuff were distributed at will.

[(06:02)](#!):

So just as the pre-revolution was heating up, the Palais Royale served as the great clearinghouse for any and all dangerously seditious notions like, hey, maybe we should call the Estates General again. This political and literary patronage made Orl\xc3\xa9ans very popular with the people and very unpopular with the inner royal family, most especially Queen Marie Antoinette, who saw in everything Orl\xc3\xa9ans did further proof that he was going to try to overthrow the Bourbons and set himself up as king. Now for his part, Orl\xc3\xa9ans hated the Queen right back, believing her to be a frivolous spendthrift whose loyalty to France was suspect at best.

[(06:43)](#!):

So the really critical thing to understand here is that in the late 1780s, when the political and economic reform movement was running into Enlightenment philosophy, which was running into complaints about the king and the church, they were all coming together in the Palais Royale, which was owned and operated by the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans. So though the Queen’s paranoia about her husband’s cousin went too far, I mean she blamed him for everything, it’s really not hard to see why she thought him and his money were behind all the misfortunes that were about to befall her family.

[(07:18)](#!):

When the monarchy went bankrupt and Controller General Calonne had to call the Assembly of Notables in 1787, the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans was of course invited, because he had to be invited, he was the First Prince of the Blood, and he of course became the most prominent critic of Calonne’s reform package. Then during the disastrous royal session of November 1787 that we talked about in episode 3.7, that was when the king was supposed to make nice and instead went off script and demanded fealty to his will, it was the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans who got up and stammered that what the king was doing was illegal. On this affront, got Orl\xc3\xa9ans exiled from Paris again, helping to spark another round of pointed complaints against the whole Lettre des Cach\xc3\xa9 system that was now being used to silence the great patron of French liberty.

[(08:06)](#!):

When the Estates General was finally called in the spring of 1789, the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans was of course elected to the second estate, and he was clearly ready to stand out as one of the liberal noble champions of the third estate. After Louis failed to intimidate the third estate during another disastrous royal session, the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans was the one who led the delegation of 47 nobles into the now self-proclaimed National Assembly, which effectively ended any possibility that the estate might be kept separate. This forced Louis to call on everyone else to come together. We talked about all of this back in episode 3.10.

[(08:45)](#!):

Now as if all this standing up to the king wasn’t bad enough, do you remember where it was that Camille de Moulin gave his famous speech that roused Paris to arms and led directly to the fall of the Bastille in July 1789? That’s right, he delivered it from atop a caf\xc3\xa9 table in the Palais Royale. This left no doubt in the minds of the king’s immediate family that the Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans was orchestrating the revolution to oust them from power and get himself crowned king.

[(09:16)](#!):

But though this all looks really suspicious, Orl\xc3\xa9ans is actually not much of an arch puppeteer. What’s going on here is that the French Revolution was a time of rampant paranoia, when everyone \xe2\x80\x94 royalists and moderates and revolutionaries, whoever \xe2\x80\x94 were all convinced that everyone else was a part of some vast sinister plot to destroy them. So while the royal family was now convinced that Orl\xc3\xa9ans was a revolutionary mastermind, really he was just a rich liberal noble who enjoyed tweaking his cousins.

[(09:48)](#!):

If he was really aiming to overthrow them, he certainly never did much to finally close the deal. And indeed, once things started getting a little nuts in 1789, Orl\xc3\xa9ans backed off and attempted to get right with the king and queen. He even accepted an order to leave the country and go on a little diplomatic mission up to England when the king asked him to. And then, if there was ever a moment for Orl\xc3\xa9ans to try to capitalize on all this alleged sinister plotting, it was right after the flight to Varennes, when the king and queen were utterly discredited and suspended from power, but the duke to Orl\xc3\xa9ans made no attempt to seize the crown. He, of course, had followers pushing him in that direction. But instead of doing that, we find evidence that he actually tried to help his cousins through the crisis. But of course, by that point, they were so ticked off at him that they rejected all his overtures.

[(10:41)](#!):

After the flight to Varennes, Orl\xc3\xa9ans decided that the time had finally come to make a good show of his permanent commitment to the revolution, and he started publicly calling himself Citizen Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9, and it was under that name that he was elected to the national convention in September 1792. But once in the convention, Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 discovered that the times had really changed around him. He sat with Robespierre in the mountain, but even as he tried to keep up with the times, he discovered that he was now little more than an embarrassment and a liability for the mountain. This was the age of the republic, and despite his superficial name change, everyone knew he was a prince of the blood. The charge that he had made revolution to get himself crowned king was no longer an accusation thrown at him by right-wing conservatives, but rather now by left-wing radicals.

[(11:35)](#!):

In their war on the mountain, the Girondins twice made direct attacks on Philippe and accused the mountain of being his accomplices, which forced the mountain into the uncomfortable position of defending Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9, and saying, well, now this is all a bunch of crazy talk, he’s not really like that. But even they had doubts about his real motives. When the time came to sit in judgment on the king, and Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 voted death without appeal, it was impossible even for his alleged allies to not believe that he wasn’t still trying to pave the way for his own coronation.

[(12:10)](#!):

Whether he really wanted to be king or not is a mystery of his inner mind that we’ll likely never know the answer to. But if Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 did want to be king, he pretty much blew any shot he had at it quite a long time ago. In the spring of 1793, he was finally brought down by events outside his control. As we talked about back in episode 3.27, when General Dumouriez defected, Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9’s firstborn son and heir went with him.

[(12:40)](#!):

When this defection led to a general crackdown on aristocrats still in France, there was nothing Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 could say or do to avoid getting swept up by the authorities. His son had just been an accomplice to one of the great treasonous betrayals of the whole revolution. Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 was arrested in April 1793, and all his assets were seized. Once this is all said and done, I have some ambition to cobble together a book on the children that the revolution devoured, and the first chapter will be about the duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, who did so much in the late 1780s to harbor political dissidents and create a hotbed of activism that fed directly into the revolution, and who then gave so much patronage and money to the cause in the early going.

[(13:28)](#!):

He gave it protection when no one else would. He was so involved in the early days that, as I said, the king and queen truly thought that the entire revolution was a massive plot by the duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans to oust them from power. But that turned out to not really be the case, and it is a little bit ironic that those same accusations were the accusations that would bring him down, but they would ultimately come from the left, not the right.

[(13:55)](#!):

Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9 languished in prison until November, but once the reign of terror got going, he was moved quickly to the front of the line, what with being a prince of the blood and all. On November 6, 1793, Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9, formerly duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, was tried, convicted, and guillotined all on the same day. But there is an interesting little postscript to all this. After Napoleon went down and the brothers of Louis XVI came back into town to restore the monarchy, they wound up running an arch-conservative kingdom that, in the words of Talleyrand, had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

[(14:34)](#!):

So after about fifteen years of enduring the Bourbons attempting to turn French citizens back into French subjects, the French got sick of it all and overthrew the restored Bourbons in July 1830. The man they turned to to lead a new constitutional monarchy was the duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans son, Louis Philippe. So just as Marie Antoinette feared, the House of Orl\xc3\xa9ans did eventually succeed in overthrowing and replacing the House of Warmen, it just took a little longer than she thought. Okay, so next week there will not be an episode, because I only managed to crank out three supplementals before I left.

[(15:13)](#!):

But when we return in two weeks, I will be just getting back from the first ever American Revolution tour, and to celebrate, I wrote up a little thing on the young French ambassador dispatched by the National Convention in early 1793 to drum up support for revolutionary France in the new United States of America. With all of Europe now arrayed against them, it was critical that France secure support from their Republican brothers in the New World. Which is why it was so unfortunate that the young ambassador the Convention sent was the needlessly provocative and endlessly infuriating CITIZEN GENET.

[(02:26)](#!):

So this week’s supplemental is an outgrowth of two things. First, listener James Ruff’s question during the 250th episode about American attitudes toward the French Revolution. So congratulations, James, this episode is partly your fault. But it also comes from another little project that I’ll go ahead and tease right now. For those of you who are also Dan Carlin fans, he may have directed you over to this debut episode of the 10 American Presidents podcast that he narrated about Richard Nixon for British podcaster Royfield Brown. Well, Royfield talked me into doing the Washington episode, which should be coming out at some point soon. And there’s already a little short pre-interview with me about George Washington posted up already. If you Google 10 American Presidents podcast, I’m sure you’ll be able to find it. So between the 250th episode and preparing to talk about George Washington for roughly 30 hours straight, I got deep into the weeds of the thoroughly entertaining Citizen Gen\xc3\xa9 affair. Edmund Charles Gen\xc3\xa9 was born in 1763 in Versailles. He was the youngest of nine children and the son of the head clerk of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So his father basically ran the central clearinghouse for correspondence and intelligence during the Seven Years’ War and the American War of Independence. So from the day he was born, Gen\xc3\xa9 was immersed in the world of international politics.

[(03:57)](#!):

Young Edmund was also something of a precocious little genius, and by the time he hit puberty, he was fluent in six different languages, though as we will see, not one of those languages was the language of diplomacy. At the age of 18, he was appointed to a position as court translator, and then in 1788 at the ripe old age of 25, Gen\xc3\xa9 was dispatched on his first foreign assignment, joining the French embassy attached to the court of Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg. This was of course just before the Revolution broke out, and when it did, Gen\xc3\xa9 was a pretty staunch supporter.

[(04:34)](#!):

After a childhood spent in the palace at Versailles, and now a year spent at the opulent court of Catherine the Great, Gen\xc3\xa9 had come to loathe the extravagant despotism of old Europe, and it would appear that he was unable to keep his disdain for the trappings of monarchy to himself. After one too many indiscretions, Catherine got sick of him and declared him persona non grata in 1792, calling his presence in Russia both superfluous and intolerable.

[(05:02)](#!):

Once back in Paris, the insurrection of August 10th upended everything, and after the national convention convened, Gen\xc3\xa9 was appointed ambassador to the United States, surely the one country on earth that might stick with revolutionary France now that it was a republic. But keep in the back of your mind that Gen\xc3\xa9 received this appointment in the early days of the convention, when the Girondins still held the levers of power. Once winter passed and war with the rest of Europe declared, Gen\xc3\xa9 sailed away from France and landed in Charleston, South Carolina on April 8th, 1793.

[(05:39)](#!):

Word of his arrival preceded him, and when he landed, he found himself an immediate smash hit. The southern Jeffersonians were far more enthusiastic about the French Revolution than the northern Federalists were, so Gen\xc3\xa9 was welcomed with open arms in South Carolina, and a string of parties were thrown in his honor.

[(05:59)](#!):

Gen\xc3\xa9 loved every minute of it, and the citizens of Charleston appeared to love every minute of him. He was young, still just 30 years old. He was handsome and charming and flamboyant and bursting with revolutionary confidence. He encouraged his new American friends to call him Citizen Gen\xc3\xa9 instead of Monsieur, as was now the style in republican Paris. Besides enjoying the trappings of being a celebrity, Gen\xc3\xa9 had a list of things that were expected of him now that he was in the United States. He was to secure U.S. support and maybe even protection for French colonies in the West Indies. He was to press for early repayment of debts that the Americans had racked up during the War of Independence. He was to negotiate a new commercial treaty to help keep France supplied with all the stuff they were now having a hard time scrounging up.

[(06:48)](#!):

All of that would have to wait, though, until he got up to the American capital in Philadelphia. But there was another thing on his to-do list that he could get going on right now. According to the American-French treaty signed back in 1778, French privateers based in American ports could go out and attack British merchant ships and then come back to those American ports with their prizes. So with the blessing of South Carolina’s governor, Gen\xc3\xa9 commissioned four new privateer ships and issued them official certificates under the protection of French law. Not without a certain flair, these four ships were dubbed the Republican, the Anti-George, the St. Culottes, and the Citizen Gen\xc3\xa9.

[(07:32)](#!):

Up in Philadelphia, the arrival of Citizen Gen\xc3\xa9 was more a cause for concern than celebration for President George Washington and his cabinet. It was still unclear whether the Treaty of 1778 was still operative, signed as it was by a man who had just gotten his head chopped off. Washington himself sure didn’t think it was operative anymore, and he believed with every fiber of his being that the United States was best served by remaining neutral in any European war.

[(08:01)](#!):

The young country was simply not strong enough to play ball on that level. So on April the 18th, Washington posed a set of wide-ranging questions to his cabinet on the immediate and future course of American foreign policy. But really, it all boiled down to whether the United States should issue a neutrality proclamation.

[(08:22)](#!):

Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, not wanting any part of a French alliance, recommended immediately declaring neutrality. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, who may have welcomed a French alliance but knew Washington was wary, said that the United States should hedge its bets. We’ll let the French make their offer, and then let the British make their offer, and then we’ll decide which is better.

[(08:48)](#!):

But in making this suggestion, Jefferson read Washington all wrong. The president was not happy at all about the idea of putting America’s sacred honor up on the auction block. So as he so often did, Alexander Hamilton won the point. And on April the 22nd, George Washington issued the neutrality proclamation, although technically the word neutrality never appeared.

[(09:12)](#!):

The neutrality proclamation ignited a brief firestorm in the Jeffersonian-backed Republican press. They were angry both that Washington was turning his back on an ally that had helped them win independence, and also that he had bypassed Congress to do it. This was just an executive proclamation, which led to murmurings that Washington was trying to make himself a king.

[(09:34)](#!):

Meanwhile, a citizen Genet was still making his way north. Everywhere he stopped, he was greeted like some kind of popular itinerant preacher spreading the gospel of revolution. As he moved, a new breed of popular clubs began to spring up, clubs that seemed to owe a lot to the model of the Jacobin Club. The first one appeared in Philadelphia in April, and by year’s end there would be ten more, then twenty more the year after that. These popular societies were of course protected by the First Amendment’s right to free association, but President Washington did not like them one bit, and in time he would come to actively hate them and suspect them of fomenting treason against the federal government. Almost all of the members of the society seemed to be ex-anti-federalists, all those guys who had led the charge against the Constitution, and they were now actively cheering on even the most excessive phases of the French Revolution. So there was no telling what these guys might do.

[(10:35)](#!):

It finally took a month for Genet to get from Charleston to Philadelphia, a delay that did not endear him to George Washington even a little bit. On May the 16th, Genet finally entered the Capitol, and like everywhere else he was greeted as a hero, and he gave a great speech to an enthusiastic crowd. In the President’s house, George Washington wondered when the new ambassador from France was going to get around to actually presenting his credentials to the head of state of the United States of America.

[(11:05)](#!):

When Genet finally did decide to present his credentials, he was greeted with a calculated coldness by Washington. But Genet dismissed the possible implications of this coldness for the success of his mission. He had just spent the last month being convinced that the whole country was with him. Washington’s stiff demeanor was just proof that the old general was out of touch.

[(11:28)](#!):

Before Genet arrived in Philadelphia, the source of what would become some pretty explosive tension had already sailed up the Delaware River, a French ship with two captured British vessels in tow. After his meeting with the President, Genet set to work rechristening one of those ships, La Petite Democrat, and he commissioned it into his little privateer fleet. Washington was furious that Genet was, in Washington’s mind, threatening American neutrality. But Genet believed it was his right under the old treaty to do exactly what he was doing. And besides, he was a popular hero, while old man Washington needed to be put out to pasture. By the beginning of June, even Jefferson was starting to tell Genet to tone it down, that strutting around openly defying George Washington was only hurting their shared cause. Genet replied that Washington had clearly been put under the thumb by the Federalist Party, who were using the doddering President as a puppet to erect an American monarchy.

[(12:31)](#!):

Jefferson was indignant about this reply. Whether he recognized that Genet’s confidence was likely fed by propaganda Jefferson’s own press hacks were writing, we don’t know.

[(12:44)](#!):

As the refitting of La Petite Democrat neared completion, Genet was busy writing bold letters home that he had the old general on the run, and that the people were with him. When the President left the Capitol for a few weeks on personal business, Jefferson told Genet that he better not try to sail the ship out of the harbor until the President got back. Alexander Hamilton and Secretary of War Henry Knox discussed ramping up the military presence at the mouth of the Delaware to stop La Petite Democrat if Genet tried to defy the order.

[(13:15)](#!):

But Genet said that he would wait until Washington returned, though he also said that if Washington didn’t say it was okay for the ship to set sail, that Genet was going to go over the President’s head and appeal directly to the American people. The people, after all, were the true sovereign. Now a threat like that is, of course, an unthinkable breach of diplomatic protocol, and even Thomas Jefferson now realized that citizen Genet was turning out to be a disaster. Then, two days after saying he wouldn’t launch the ship before Washington got back, Genet said, eh, screw it, and launched the ship.

[(13:53)](#!):

When Washington got back to Philadelphia, he was cross-eyed with rate, and he had his cabinet drop a series of explicit orders laying down the rules of conduct between the neutral Americans and all European belligerents. Privateers cannot be armed in American ports. Their prizes cannot be offloaded in American ports. In response to this, Genet started to follow through with his threat to go over Washington’s head. With French sailors roaming Philadelphia getting people riled up, Genet himself delivered a fiery speech that called on the citizens of Philadelphia to defend true liberty, not the crypto-royalist Federalists and their puppet George Washington.

[(14:35)](#!):

For a few nights running, huge crowds roamed the streets, ominously congregating around the President’s house and demanding that he declare war on England. This was all, of course, too much for the cabinet, and by the end of July they were deep in discussions about how to demand the recall of Genet without offending the French government. After all, neutrality meant neutrality. The last thing they wanted was for France to declare war on the United States, too, and force the country into a fight it didn’t want to fight.

[(15:06)](#!):

It was suggested that maybe they deliver all of Genet’s impetuous correspondence to Paris and say, look, just send us a guy who won’t try to blatantly undermine an elected government. But before they came to any firm decisions, Federalists up in New York, specifically John Jay and Rufus King, took it upon themselves to publish the correspondence. The result was a swift backlash against the French ambassador. Genet had made the mistake of both believing his own hype and the anti-Washington invective streaming off the partisan Jeffersonian presses. He completely missed the fact that George Washington was George Washington, an overwhelming majority of Americans still thought of him as nothing less than a minor deity. Genet had convinced himself that he was beating George Washington in a popularity contest. But when it came out how flagrantly disrespectful he was being, it turned out that he was not.

[(16:03)](#!):

In late August 1793, the cabinet decided it was time to formally demand the recall of citizen Genet. But of course, we know what has happened back in Paris in the meantime, don’t we? That’s right, the Girondins that appointed him to his job have been purged from the convention. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the now mountain-controlled convention has already dispatched a replacement for Genet with orders to maintain friendly relations with the United States lest they too be pushed into an anti-French coalition. The new ambassador arrived with instructions to arrest Genet and put him on a boat back to France where he would stand trial for his crimes. And everyone knew exactly what that meant.

[(16:46)](#!):

The once haughty and disrespectful Genet then came down and begged Washington for asylum. At the urging of no less an advisor than Alexander Hamilton, the president granted the request. They may not like the bugger, but they weren’t going to send him to his death just for being obnoxious. So Genet stayed in America. For the rest of his life, as it turned out. He wound up wooing the daughter of hugely powerful New York governor George Clinton, and then settled into a life of rustic tranquility.

[(17:17)](#!):

Having thus avoided being guillotined at the age of 30, a citizen Genet lived out his days on a comfortable little estate overlooking the Hudson River. In a last act of revolutionary patriotism, he died at the ripe old age of 71 on July 14, 1834, the 45th anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.

And welcome to Revolutions. Promote 3.35, the law of 14 freemare.

[(01:36)](#!):

So welcome back to our regularly scheduled program, I hope you enjoyed the supplementals while I was away. The tours, as usual, were fantastic, and I’ve got a little collection of pictures up at RevolutionsPodcast.com so you can get an idea of just how much fun we had and just how many different cool things we saw on both the European and American legs of the tour. Before we dive back into the action, though, I have one big piece of news that will have an impact on how the rest of the French Revolution is going to play out. Mrs. Revolutions is pregnant with baby number two, and the due date is in early October. So the French Revolution is now officially scheduled to wrap up the last week of September.

This means a couple of things. First, I’m setting the end point at the coup of 18 bremer, which is the coup that brings Napoleon to power as First Consul in November 1799. Second, by necessity, I’m going to have to truncate a few things over the next five months to make sure that we cover everything. Fortunately, the really truly revolutionary stuff peaks with the fall of Robespierre in the summer of 1794, and we’re already fast coming up on that as we speak. The five years after the Termidorian Reaction are thankfully a little less hectic than the five years leading up to it. So there just won’t be as much to cover as there was in, say, 1793, when simultaneous and critically important eruptions on all fronts turned it into the year that would never end.

[(03:04)](#!):

1793 has been fun, but it will never be this complicated ever again.

[(03:10)](#!):

So when all is said and done, the French Revolution will wind up being just over 50 episodes long, which feels about right. Once Napoleon seizes to power with the help of a certain sly ex-bishop, I’m going to take some paternity leave, and then when I come back I will launch into the long-promised series on the Haitian Revolution. But then after that, it’s kind of wide open. I’m absolutely committed to doing the Mexican Revolution and the Russian Revolution and probably the Cuban Revolution, but before we get there I might find the revolutionary event surrounding Simon Bolivar irresistible, and maybe I’ll figure out a way to tackle 1848 without it becoming too unwieldy, and maybe I’ll roll out some kind of listeners choice contest to point me towards a revolution that you really super badly want me to cover.

[(03:54)](#!):

Who knows? By that point I will have a newborn and a toddler running around the house, and plugging my way blindly through the chaos will be the name of the game, so I will just be making it up as we go along. So that’s the big news here at Revolution’s headquarters. There is another baby on the way. And with that, let’s get back to plugging our way blindly through the chaos.

[(04:16)](#!):

So when last we left off, let’s see, it was October the 31st, 1793, and the Girondins had all just been executed. And by the by we were all just at the conciergery and saw Marie Antoinette’s cell and the chapel where the Girondins had their final meal together. It was pretty neat given that I had just finished the episode covering their executions right before I left. Anyway, the execution of the Girondins cleared out most of them in one fell swoop, but there were a few loose ends to deal with. For example, Madame Rolland, who had been arrested back during the insurrection of May the 31st, June the 2nd for her well-known part in organizing the Girondin faction in the first place.

[(04:55)](#!):

After spending the last few months cooped up in the conciergery writing her memoirs, she was finally brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal a week after all her friends were killed. Convicted of treason under the speedy new rules that made it super easy to obtain convictions, Madame Rolland was led to the guillotine on November the 8th, and as she stood on the scaffold, she uttered her famous last words, oh liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name. Then zip thud, the end. Her husband, Jean-Marie Rolland, had himself managed to slip out of Paris when his colleagues were getting arrested and had been in hiding ever since. When he learned that his wife had finally been executed, he despaired and killed himself on the side of a road near Rouen. Over the next few months, the few remaining Girondins who had gotten away were one by one either apprehended, with predictably fatal consequences, or they committed suicide to avoid Madame La Guillotine. Jerome Petillon and a few others managed to hold out until June 1794, when they finally decided that Robespierre’s great terror would never relent and committed suicide. That was just a month before Robespierre was himself overthrown and guillotined.

[(06:07)](#!):

While we’re tying up loose ends, I may as well mention that just a few days after Madame Rolland was executed, old Jean Sylvain Bailly was hauled before the Revolutionary Tribunal and accused of intentionally orchestrating the massacre of the Champs de Mars. It took no time at all to convict the man who had stood at the very center of Jacques-Louis David’s great and unfinished painting, the Oath of the Tennis Court.

[(06:30)](#!):

On November 12, the guillotine was moved from its spot in the Place de la R\xc3\xa9volution to the Champs de Mars so that Bailly could be executed on the spot where he had betrayed the nation. In the freezing rain, he stood on the scaffold while the audience heckled him. One guy apparently shouted, Do you tremble, Bailly? And Bailly responded, Yes, but only because it’s cold. Then zip thud, the end.

[(06:55)](#!):

As I mentioned a few episodes back, though these kinds of major political figures are the victims most often associated with the terror, the bulk of the victims were not in fact major political figures. They were obscure men and women who happened to be on the wrong side of the day’s reigning political faction, and who happened to have fallen under the jurisdiction of a particularly bloodthirsty representative on mission. As though we’ve already established that the terror was mostly operative in departments recently in revolt against Paris, the whims of the particular representative sent to your town played a huge role in how vicious the terror was going to be.

[(07:34)](#!):

The first great example of this came in Lyon, where originally the wheelchair-bound George Couton had been dispatched to oversee the inevitable reprisals against the city once it capitulated. But after Lyon did capitulate, Couton quickly discovered that he had no taste for implementing revolutionary justice, and he was replaced by his more zealous colleague, Jean-Marie Collot de Bois. Collot had been one of the guys appointed to the Committee of Public Safety to mollify the Saint-Cue lot after the insurrection of September 5th, and he absolutely had a taste for revolutionary justice.

[(08:09)](#!):

In his former life, Collot had been an actor and dramatist who had, coincidentally enough, spent 1787 running one of the major theaters in Lyon, to apparently mixed reviews. When Collot came back to Lyon at the end of October 1793 to take up his new assignment, he was appalled at the bare minimum Couton had done to punish the Federalist stronghold. Only a couple of dozen people executed, only a few houses destroyed. This simply would not do. Didn’t Couton realize that the people of Lyon didn’t know great theater when they saw it? I mean, were a bunch of dangerous counter-revolutionaries threatening the indivisibility of the nation? These people must pay.

[(08:53)](#!):

Arriving along with Collot was a contingent of the Saint-Cue lot-filled revolutionary army that had also been established after September 5th. Collot dispatched these guys every night to conduct house searches, overturning every inch of the city looking for suspects and evidence of treason, which of course they found everywhere.

[(09:12)](#!):

But though he speeded up the accusation and execution process, Collot was still dissatisfied that by the end of November, only about 200 enemies of the nation had been killed. So he streamlined the operation of the tribunal to dispense justice even quicker. Almost overnight, another 300 were condemned. But now the convictions were coming in so fast that even the super-efficient guillotine couldn’t keep up. So Collot had to turn to mass executions, and he settled first on the practice of lining everyone up next to an open grave and then blasting them with a cannon. Really horrible stuff, especially when a bunch of the condemned turned out to have been merely wounded by the cannon shot, and they had to be finished off one by one by hand.

[(10:01)](#!):

Yuck. This all went on through the winter, and by the end of April 1794, somewhere close to 2,000 people will have been killed in Lyon, making the city one of the major epicenters of the Terror. And I’ve heard that to this day, Lyon is still kind of mad at Paris about it. But though Collot is one of the most infamous practitioners of government by terror, he was not the most infamous. That honor must surely go to Jean-Baptiste Carier, a man who may in fact have been literally insane when he was assigned to the Vend\xc3\xa9e to help end the great uprising.

[(10:37)](#!):

But before we get into the grisly details of Carier’s work, let’s first wrap up the last major organized campaign of the uprising. A campaign that will see the Republic emerge victorious, though that victory will not really end the insurrection. It will simply turn it into a torturous guerrilla brushfire rather than a field army-led inferno.

[(11:01)](#!):

So when last we left the war in the West, the rebels had been soundly defeated at Cholay on October 17th. But the remains of the Catholic and Royal Army had managed to slip across the Loire River into Brittany. Their plan was to race north to the coastal city of Granville, which was the nearest port to the British island of Jersey, from which they would hopefully be able to get weapons, provisions, and maybe even some armed backup.

[(11:27)](#!):

As the rebel caravan progressed, they picked up disgruntled Bretons along the way. Because remember, the rural population of Brittany had started to revolt the same time the Vend\xc3\xa9e had exploded. There were just more Republican troops around to put the clamp down. So by the time the rebel army reached Granville on November 14th, they were numbering something like 60,000 men, women, and children. They then set up shop and started to lay siege to the city, praying that British relief would arrive soon.

[(11:58)](#!):

But unfortunately, though the British and the rebels had been in touch with each other over the last few months, events had moved too quickly after Cholay to alert the commander of Jersey that this rebel horde was on its way. The intelligence was being routed through London. So though they were just 50 miles away with plenty of supplies, the British garrison at Jersey didn’t get word until November 26th that the rebels were in dire straits and needed help. By then, it was already too late.

[(12:27)](#!):

The British sailed down to Granville on December 2nd, but the rebels had already been forced to abandon the siege for lack of supplies and equipment. Their position in Brittany untenable without British aid, they elected to try to force their way back into their home territory. But on December 4th, they were unable to force their way back across the Loire. A week later, an army led by Francois Vesterman caught up with the rapidly disintegrating rebel army at Le Mans and in a night attack smashed them to bits. Vesterman ordered no quarter given, and something like 10,000 people were killed either in the battle or in the retreat that followed. Then on December 23rd, the last 10,000 or so were cornered at Sabine. Almost all of them were either killed in the ensuing battle or in the mass executions that followed. Vesterman supposedly wrote the Committee of Public Safety following the battle that, quote, “‘There is no more of on day, Republican citizens. It died beneath our free sword, with its women and its children. I have just buried it in the swamps in the woods of Sabine. Following the orders that you gave me, I crushed their children beneath the horses’ hooves, massacred the women, who, those at least, will bear no more brigands. I do not have a single prisoner to reproach myself with. I have exterminated them all.’” But this letter is, of course, either extreme hyperbole or very possibly a later fabrication. But it does fit in generally with Republican conduct after major field operations ceased, especially given the conduct, as we’re about to see, of Jean-Baptiste Carier to say nothing of the infernal columns, which haven’t even gotten rolling yet.

[(14:07)](#!):

While the war proper was being waged north of the Loire, Carier was dispatched as representative on mission to Nantes, with near-absolute authority over the three Vend\xc3\xa9e departments that had been in revolt. Carier had been a far-left member of the Mountain since being elected to the National Convention, and he had already been dispatched as representative on mission once before up to Normandy, where he had shown a judicious temperament, and the revolutionary tribunals he ran there conformed to something resembling the rule of law.

[(14:38)](#!):

But when he was transferred down to Nantes, something had changed. Whether it was the cue from Paris that terror was now the order of the day, or whether he actually became a little unhinged after watching the brutal struggles with the Catholic and royal rebels, Carier appears to have arrived in Nantes with nothing but cold-blooded brutality in his heart. A brutality directed most especially at the local clergy, who Carier believed were behind the entire counter-revolutionary insurrection. His plan was to wipe them all out.

[(15:10)](#!):

Under Carier’s direction, accusation and conviction quickly became synonymous. It would be too much to even call the tribunal’s processing of prisoners a show trial. If you were taken into custody, you were doomed. But Carier soon ran into the problem that Callot had run into in Lyon. Even the super-efficient guillotine was not proving efficient enough. After initiating large-scale firing squads in the quarries outside of town, Carier then devised an even more sinister method of mass execution, a method that would be used primarily against the hated clergy.

[(15:44)](#!):

Carier ordered carpenters to rig floating barges so that they could be sunk at will. On November 19, 90 priests were hogtied and led onto the barge. The barge was then floated a distance out into the loire, the plugs were pulled, and the barge sunk, drowning the struggling prisoners. Carier appears to have been so delighted with the result that the mass drownings became a regular thing. About once a week for the next two months or so, a barge full of prisoners would be floated out into the loire and sunk, a process that would become known as Republican Baptisms in the national bathtub.

[(16:23)](#!):

As the drownings proceeded, new humiliations were devised, and in at least one instance, men and women were stripped naked and chained together in pairs before they were drowned \xe2\x80\x94 the revolutionaries laughingly referring to these as Republican marriages. Of course, as the drownings progressed, they became more indiscriminate. Rather than simply targeting priests, now we have old men and women and children all being killed if they were suspected of being a royalist sympathizer, which is frankly about as flimsy an accusation as you’ll ever find this side of Pol Pot’s, hey, that guy is wearing glasses. The final grisly details are disputed, but somewhere between two and four thousand men, women, and children were drowned in the loire over the winter of 1793-1794. And that was on top of all the people that were being guillotined or killed in the mass firing squads.

[(17:18)](#!):

But don’t worry though, Carier will finally get his in September 1794, but not before he denies that he had anything at all to do with those terrible drownings in Nantes. The guy was a real piece of work.

[(17:32)](#!):

The cases of Callot in Lyon and Carier in Nantes represent the most extreme edge of the first stage of the terror. An extreme edge reached not just because Lyon and Nantes were hotbeds of revolt, but also because of the individual personalities of the men in charge of the reprisals. Callot and Carier were bloodthirsty fanatics. By way of contrast, over this same period down in Marseille, another Federalist stronghold, just under a thousand people were brought to trial by the local Revolutionary Tribunal. About half were acquitted outright, and of those convicted only about half again were executed. 289 to be precise.

[(18:14)](#!):

Meanwhile over in Bordeaux, the capital of the Girondin homeland and a city that had explicitly called for a Federalist army to march on Paris, only 300 would be executed from the whole Girondin department. This random and unsystematic application of the terror started to trouble the members of the Committee of Public Safety back in Paris. In some places, unchecked and bloody excess threatened to create far more enemies than it eliminated, while in other places there appeared to be a dangerous leniency, a leniency possibly purchased from unscrupulous representatives on mission, ready to turn their nearly unlimited powers in the direction not of national purity, but personal gain. The untidiness of it all rankled the incorruptible Robespierre to no end.

[(19:04)](#!):

But that was not the only bit of untidiness that was rankling Robespierre to no end at the end of 1793. The other big thing is that this is also the moment in the Revolution when violent de-Christianization really takes over, and Robespierre had no truck at all with the atheists or their plan to destroy the Church. Not only did he consider organized religion essential to civic life, but Robespierre firmly believed that de-Christianization was actually a major part of that foreign plot which was designed to undermine and discredit the Revolution, because, as we’ve seen, nothing alienates people from the Revolution faster than assault on the Church.

[(19:44)](#!):

This is something we’ve been following from the very beginning, like for example when those first civic oaths back in 1789 turned a bunch of disaffected parish priests from supporters of the Revolution into arch enemies overnight. And then of course we’ve seen how the attacks on the local clergy more than anything else really got the Vend\xc3\xa9e uprising off the ground.

[(20:07)](#!):

Robespierre was convinced that the only people who would push for an even more extreme anti-religious platform had to have some sort of sinister ulterior motive. He just couldn’t believe that for a lot of the leftist revolutionaries, eliminating religious superstition from public life was actually the logical conclusion of the whole project. The latest cycle of anti-religiosity can be traced first of course to the rise of Jacques Hebert as the voice of the people in Paris. Hebert was an avowed atheist who wanted to tear the whole facade of superstition down. But more specifically, it can be traced to a representative on mission named Joseph Fouchet. And for you Napoleon-philes out there, yes, this is that Joseph Fouchet. A world-class survivor and side-switcher, Fouchet would wear many many hats during a political career that would take him all the way through to the Restoration, and he is at present in the early far-left radical phase of his career.

[(21:09)](#!):

He had been assigned as representative on mission in the Bonde in the early days of the uprising, and had emerged from that mission convinced that the Catholic Church needed to be eradicated if the Revolution was going to survive. So when, in the autumn of 1793, he was appointed representative to Nieve in central France, he arrived with a rather bold plan.

[(21:31)](#!):

On his own initiative, he started forcibly de-Christianizing the department. With the help of volunteers who formed a local revolutionary army modeled on the Paris version, Fouchet and his boys went around stripping churches of all religious icons, gathering up whatever valuables they could find in the churches, and then shipping them off to the treasury to be used to fund the Revolution’s wars. He even went so far as to remove crosses from cemeteries, and ordered that the inscription “‘Death is an eternal sleep’ be posted outside the newly rationalized burial grounds.” In place of all this old superstition, Fouchet introduced a new civic religion that would merge seamlessly in with the short-lived Cult of Reason, which we’re going to talk about here in a second.

[(22:18)](#!):

Fouchet’s de-Christianization really caught on when Pierre Gaspar Chamet, a native of Nieve who also happened to be president of the Paris Commune, came home for a visit. Already a staunch enemy of the counter-revolutionary superstitions of the clergy, Chamet was excited by Fouchet’s zeal, and returned to Paris fired up to transform the capital along the same lines, and then hopefully export the movement across France.

[(22:46)](#!):

Fouchet, meanwhile, was subsequently reassigned to join Callot in Lyon, where he continued his zealous destructions of all things Christian, and helped Callot implement some of the worst excesses of the Reign of Terror. The fact that Fouchet managed to survive through Termidor and get on with the rest of his long and varied career is actually kind of mind-blowing.

[(23:07)](#!):

When Chamet returned to Paris, he immediately set about organizing the Festival of Reason, which would culminate with Notre Dame being rechristened\xe2\x80\x94though that’s probably not the best way to put it\xe2\x80\x94rededicated as the Temple of Reason. They installed an altar to liberty inside to replace the Christian altar, and two philosophy was inscribed above the main door. The Festival of Reason itself involved girls dressing up in old Roman togas but wearing a tri-color sash on top of it, and then everyone gathering around an actress who was playing the part of the goddess of reason. This festival, or something like it, was then repeated throughout France as copycat revolutionary armies sprang up across the country, eventually numbering something like 40,000 people. These guys started stripping away all the symbols of Christianity. Churches were closed, clergy were forced to renounce their offices and take wives, and we’re talking now about civic clergymen who had sworn every revolutionary oath that had ever been put in front of them. So yeah, this was no longer about putting the Church under the authority of the nation. It was about destroying it completely.

[(24:20)](#!):

In place of Christianity, men like Hebert and Shomet and a bunch of others hoped to found the cult of reason, which they dreamed of as a sort of civic anti-religion. It would have the outward trappings of religion\xe2\x80\x94there would be congregations and acts of devotions\xe2\x80\x94but there would be no god to worship, only the people who they would try to perfect through the noble pursuit of truth and liberty and reason, human faculties that would be admired but not worshipped. For a brief little while, over the winter of 1793-1794, the cult of reason picked up adherents among the sans-culottes and were led by more radical intellectuals, particularly in the Paris Commune.

[(25:03)](#!):

But it was all strongly resisted by Robespierre and Danton, who both thought the whole project dangerously counterproductive. Both were strongly and publicly opposed to de-Christianization. Robespierre called the festival of reason a ridiculous farce. He said that atheism was aristocratic, that the people believed in a supreme being, and that trying to violently purge religion from France was folly of the worst kind. Danton thundered in the Jacobin Club that the excesses of the anti-Pius would do far more harm than good in the end.

[(25:37)](#!):

And so, with de-Christianization, a new line is now being drawn in the revolutionary sands\xe2\x80\x94one that just so happened to parallel a line that was also being drawn in the sand over the continuation of the Terror. You see, by the end of November 1793, the situation everywhere seemed to have improved dramatically. The Federalist revolt had been pretty much squashed, except for Toulon, whose fall we’re about to get to. The rebels in the Vend\xc3\xa9e had been put to flight, and the region was nominally back in Republican hands. And then up along the frontier, the Allies were all collectively in retreat.

[(26:16)](#!):

So Danton, the man who had coined the phrase, Terror is the Order of the Day, now stood up in the Jacobins and said it was time to start winding it all back down. The emergency has passed. When he was attacked for his moderation, Robespierre of all people stood up and defended him. And this marked the opening of a new round of intense factional fighting between the revolutionaries. Those who circled around Danton, who opposed de-Christianization and wanted to dial back the Terror, were soon dubbed the Indulgence.

[(26:48)](#!):

Those who circled around Jacques Hebert, who supported de-Christianization and wanted to ratchet up the Terror, were dubbed\xe2\x80\x94well, they weren’t really dubbed anything. But taking a cue from Robespierre, Ultras is a pretty serviceable working name for them. Next week’s episode will be all about the running battle between the Indulgence and the Ultras, a battle that will be won by\xe2\x80\x94well, trick question, neither side is going to win. Because by then, Robespierre and his buddies in the Committee of Public Safety will have consolidated power to the point that they will be able to feed both the Ultras and the Indulgence to Madame La Guillotine.

[(27:27)](#!):

That final consolidation of power was made possible by a law passed by the National Convention at the beginning of December. Confronting both a haphazard reign of terror that no one seemed to be in control of, and a spontaneous and possibly sinister de-Christianization movement, a wary National Convention decided to vest in the Committee of Public Safety the last few bits of authority it needed to truly run France as a de facto dictatorship.

[(27:54)](#!):

In a sweeping piece of legislation passed on December the 4th, 1793, aka 14 free-mayor year 2 of the new calendar, virtually the entire apparatus of government\xe2\x80\x94all government, everywhere\xe2\x80\x94was put under the control of the Committee. Most and foremost, that meant bringing to heel the representatives on mission that the Convention themselves had been dispatching to run things out in the departments. Vested with nearly absolute powers in their assigned provinces, the representatives were now going to take orders from and answer to the Committee of Public Safety.

[(28:29)](#!):

All those spontaneous revolutionary armies that had been sprouting up and being deployed by the representatives were ordered to cease operations immediately.

[(28:38)](#!):

The law also gutted the power of local authorities to be anything but implementers of the Committee’s will. All those municipal and departmental governments that had been set up way back in the early days in the National Assembly were now told they could not alter or interpret decrees to suit their own needs, and certainly not initiate any of their own. Those local authorities had been a hotbed of federalism, and they were now going to be monitored very closely and given the keys to nothing. Agents would be arriving shortly to make sure that no one started thinking for themselves again, and those agents would be sending back reports to Paris every ten days like clockwork.

[(29:17)](#!):

All the local revolutionary tribunals and surveillance committees would report their findings up the chain of command, and orders would be sent back down for them to implement. The entire apparatus of the terror was now going to be centrally planned and monitored. Everything throughout France was now under the jurisdiction of the 12 men of the Committee of Public Safety.

[(29:40)](#!):

This was all, of course, anathema to everything the Revolution had once stood for, and in every way was simply a more dangerous and more comprehensive version of the centralized monarchy of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime. But Robespierre defended the necessity of the law. He said that constitutional government could not survive in the chaos and anarchy that currently defined France, the goal of a constitutional government, he said, was to preserve the republic. But we haven’t even gotten that far yet, which is why we must have revolutionary government, whose goal would be to found the republic, to put the republic on solid enough ground that later constitutional government could come in and preserve it.

[(30:20)](#!):

Now maybe Robespierre was right, maybe it all had to be done. But with the Law of 14 Fr\xc3\xa9maire, France was now run by a dictatorial committee who would inevitably, because you just knew this was coming, start to conflate their own interests with those of the nation. So God help you if the committee decided that you were a threat to their interests, because that meant ipso facto you were a threat to the nation and liable to become a victim of the newly systematized and centrally planned reign of terror.

[(30:51)](#!):

Two weeks after the Law of 14 Fr\xc3\xa9maire was put into effect, the newly empowered committee received some very good news. News that would help bolster the indulgent argument that the national emergency was receding and that the terror could be dialed back. The all-important port of Toulon had been retaken. And I find it an interesting historical coincidence that just as dictatorial government was being entrenched in Paris, the man who would in the end fully embody and perfect dictatorial government was making his debut on the world stage. Because the siege of Toulon would never have been brought to a successful conclusion had it not been for a brilliant young artillery officer named Napoleon Bonaparte. And since he will be weaving his way in and out of our story for the next five years and then ultimately bring it to a close, we will close today by introducing the boy who will be emperor.

[(31:49)](#!):

Napoleon Bonaparte was born on the island of Corsica in 1769. He was the third son of a minor noble family of Italian origin. He also just so happened to be born in the year that Corsica was ceded to the French by Genoa. Now, the internal politics of the island of Corsica are way too complex to get into here. But just know that basically the greatest leader in French history was himself not very French at all, and in his youth he was actually a Corsican nationalist who would soon be talking about the 30,000 Frenchmen who have vomited upon our shores.

[(32:24)](#!):

His family was of some means and connections, and his father served as the Corsican representative to the court of Louis XVI starting in 1777. Two years later, young Napoleon was accepted to a provincial military academy up in north central France, and upon graduation he gained admission to the prestigious military school in Paris where he trained to be an artillery officer.

[(32:46)](#!):

Now, through his years in school, it was clear to everyone, student and faculty alike, that this Bonaparte kid was crazy smart and crazy driven. He excelled at just about everything and never stopped reading, writing, studying, and thinking. Needless to say, this did not make him particularly popular with the other boys who teased him about his provincial Corsican accent. And this is of course as good a time as any to mention that Napoleon Bonaparte was not also teased about his diminutive stature because, contrary to all historical myth, he was not short. He was about 5\'7", which made him average for his day and age.

[(33:25)](#!):

His father died while he was at school, and the subsequent financial hit his family took meant that Napoleon had to race to complete a two-year program in a single year, which he was of course able to do. emerging with a commission as a second lieutenant in 1785. He served fairly anonymously in the army of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime until the revolution broke out in 1789, at which point he seems to have taken advantage of all the uncertainty and demoralization within the officer corps to take a leave of absence that wound up lasting years. He returned to Corsica and threw himself into a three-way fight for control of the island between French royalists, French revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists.

[(34:07)](#!):

But though he was close with the leader of the nationalists, Bonaparte himself decided to volunteer for the Revolutionary National Guard, which ultimately pitted him against the nationalists.

[(34:17)](#!):

Forced to leave the island in 1793, a Corsican friend brought him to the attention of Augustin Robespierre, the brother of the incorruptible Maximilien. These two guys recognized something special about young Bonaparte, and they pushed him into the artillery corps, against the wishes of the artillery commander, just as the Republican army in the southeast was coming together to stamp out the Federalist uprising in the summer of 1793. After Marseilles fell, these armies moved on to Toulon, and set up a siege that would soon draw in about 35,000 Republican soldiers.

[(34:52)](#!):

As the siege dragged on, not terribly successfully, Captain Bonaparte had zero qualms about writing a blunt letter to the Committee of Public Safety, complaining about the incompetence of the officers around him. And he wasn’t wrong. They were pretty incompetent. Bonaparte had diagnosed in about five seconds what it was going to take to break the Allied hold on Toulon, and he simply had to sit around and wait for the higher-ups to get with the program. He spent drilling his totally inexperienced troops in the finer points of artillery.

[(35:24)](#!):

A few command replacements up at the top later, Bonaparte, now a colonel, was finally ordered to do what he always knew they were going to have to do to take Toulon. He led the charge against the key British fortification on the night of December 16th, took the fortification, and was wounded in the leg in the process. Now totally exposed to a French bombardment, the Allies were forced to withdraw, but not before successfully burning a good chunk of the French fleet. This was all a huge relief for the leaders back in Paris, and a great triumph for young Bonaparte personally. It put him on the map, kicking off a career that would wind up seeing him not just on the map, but holding the map in his hands and redrawing it at will.

[(36:10)](#!):

But that is all still a ways off, and next week we will get into one of the defining factional fights of the whole revolution, the battle between the ultras and the indulgence, with the guillotine looming as punishment for defeat. But the fight would not be a defining one because of what everyone was fighting over. It would be a defining fight because in the end, everyone will lose.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.36 \xe2\x80\x93 The Liquidation Process So last week was a bit of a grab bag of topics to bring everything up to speed so that we could spend today talking about the great factional battle between the Danton-led indulgence and the Jacques-H\xc3\xa9bert-led Ultras in the first few months of 1794. As we established last week, this latest factional battle was fought over de-Christianization and the terror. The indulgence wanted to pull back from both, the Ultras wanted to go even further with both. Now had the revolution continued on the path it had been on since controller General Calonne first declared bankruptcy back in 1786, the outcome would not have been in doubt. The radical de-Christianizing terrorists would have defeated the moderate indulgence. I mean, that’s the way it’s always gone, right? Except, that since the insurrection of September 5th, the revolution has been on a new path. So this time around, the radical Ultras will actually be the first ones to go down. Not that the more moderate indulgence would have longed to savor their victory, as they themselves would be led to the guillotine less than two weeks later. Because the revolution’s new path is now being paved by Maximilien Robespierre, and it was a very narrow path that only he could see.

[(03:41)](#!):

The battle between the indulgence and the Ultras burst out into the open in early December 1793, when Camille de Moulot launched a new weekly newspaper specifically designed to counter Jacques Hebert’s anti-Christian pro-terror screeds. De Moulot dubbed his new paper the Old Courlier, clearly trying to recapture the magic of the early revolution, and reclaim spiritual ownership of the Courlier name. You see, when the original core Courlier leaders surrounding Danton had graduated up to running the country, control of the Courlier club had passed into the hands of the Saint-Qulot-backed radicals, and the current president was none other than Jacques Hebert. It had to hurt de Moulot to see the club he and his buddies had founded now perverted to serve the bloodthirsty, sacrilegious ends of the Ultras.

[(04:32)](#!):

The first issue of the Old Courlier was published on December 5th and was an instant bestseller. There were tons of people in Paris who had been cowed into silence by the radical fury of the Ultras, and they were thrilled to finally have someone giving voice to all their fears.

[(04:48)](#!):

The journalistic broadsides were echoed in the convention by the alliance between Robespierre and Danton that we touched on a bit last week. They both delivered speeches denouncing de-Christianization and the excesses of the terror. On December 6th, the convention passed a decree reaffirming the right to the freedom of worship \xe2\x80\x93 a right that was a core part of the Declaration of Rights, and a right that de-Christianization clearly threatened. And I completely forgot to mention this last week, but this is the moment in history when the word vandalism enters the world lexicon. Opponents of de-Christianization likened the destruction of church property with the destruction of Rome by the Vandals. So that’s where vandalism comes from.

[(05:33)](#!):

In the third issue of the Old Courlier, published on December 15th, Demoulin riffed off Tacitus and drew a specific parallel between revolutionary Paris and Rome under Tiberius \xe2\x80\x93 a time when fear and brutality spread like a sickness through a once-great civilization. With the rhetorical foundations laid, the Old Courlier stalwart Fabre de Glantina stood up in the convention and denounced two primary carriers of the dreaded sickness \xe2\x80\x93 Charles-Philippe Rosson and Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Nicolas Vasson.

[(06:05)](#!):

Rosson was the leader of the Paris Revolutionary Army, and he was just back from Lyon where he had been a zealous accomplice of Collo d’Ivoire. Vasson was General Secretary of the War Department, and he had been using his position to push for an even more rigorous application of the terror. Both were arrested December 17th. A few days later, Robespierre gave his tacit approval to form yet another committee \xe2\x80\x93 a committee who would be tasked with investigating wrongful arrests. Obviously, this oversight panel would act as a check on those who wanted to turn the terror into an indiscriminate bloodbath.

[(06:42)](#!):

The sudden and surprisingly popular attacks on their position caught the Ultras off guard. But despite the flurry of attacks against them, the Ultras regained their footing just a few days later. When Collo d’Ivoire heard that Rosson had been arrested, he raced back from Lyon to Paris. He reached the capital on December 22nd and gave a fiery speech in the Jacobin Club, denouncing what he saw as a sudden turn to spinelessness. When I left, we were united behind the goal of purging France of her enemies, and now I return to find the best and most patriotic men we have in jail? I mean, what the hell, people?

[(07:18)](#!):

This speech re-energized the radicals. Collo then teamed up with his fellow radical on the Committee of Public Safety, Jacques-Nicolas Biot-Varennes, and together they got the new oversight panel shut down before it even started up. So as 1793 gave way to 1794, it looked like the Committee of Public Safety itself might become a front in the war between the Indulgence and the Ultras, and then maybe inevitably a casualty.

[(07:45)](#!):

But then the East India Company scandal blew up and changed the whole dynamic. Because in the current political fight, Maximilien Robespierre was the critical swing vote. He had been leaning towards the Indulgence, but after the East India scandal broke, he straightened up very quickly. So what was the East India Company scandal? Or maybe we should start with, so what was the East India Company?

[(08:13)](#!):

The East India Company was first chartered by Louis XIV back in 1664 to help the French compete with the English and Dutch in the rapidly expanding Oriental trade markets. The company was given a monopoly over trade in the Pacific and Indian oceans, but as everyone discovered over the next century or so, state-chartered monopolies are a horrible, horrible way to do business. The French East India Company was a mess, thoroughly corrupt, and always in financial trouble.

[(08:43)](#!):

As the ministers surrounding Louis XV started to attempt some much-needed reforms after the disastrous conclusion to the Seven Years’ War, the East India Company was targeted and abolished in 1769. But sixteen years later, the company was re-chartered by Controller General Calonne, and once again given a monopoly over trade east of the Cape of Good Hope.

[(09:05)](#!):

Now originally, this monopoly was supposed to run for seven years, but of course then along comes the Revolution in 1789, and in January 1790, the more free-market-inclined delegates of the National Assembly stripped the company of its monopoly. Now exposed to the terrors of competition, the company predictably started to implode, and by the summer of 1793 was limping towards death. It was finally put out of its misery when the newly reshuffled Committee of Public Safety banned all joint-stock companies in August 1793, and the East India Company was ordered to liquidate all its assets by January 1, 1794.

[(09:46)](#!):

And that is when the scandal comes into it. The scandal itself is a little complicated, but the gist of it is that with the company slated for liquidation, financial speculators with insider information started manipulating the process to reap huge profits for themselves by selling the stock short. But that in and of itself wasn’t actually the scandal. The scandal was when certain members of the convention discovered this illegal stock manipulation, and rather than doing something about it decided, hey, let’s get in on the action.

[(10:19)](#!):

They threatened to expose the corruption and turn the speculators over to the Revolutionary Tribunal unless they were given a cut of the ill-gotten gains. To make sure no one else was tipped off to this extortion, the convention committee assigned to oversee the company secretly altered the rules of the liquidation process, allowing the company to sell off its own assets rather than having government agents handle it. This would mean fewer questions about what was being sold, how much it was being sold for, who it was being sold to, and of course whose pockets the money was actually winding up in. And wouldn’t you know it, Fabre de Glantina was the chairman of that committee, and he was the one who signed the crooked paperwork after being promised a fat bribe. This was a fatal mistake, not just for de Glantina, but for all of his friends.

[(11:11)](#!):

By mid-October, the fishiness of the liquidation process started to stink, and de Glantina decided to get out in front of things before it all blew out into the open. And that is when he went to Robespierre with the details of the foreign plot, a plot that just so happened to implicate his accomplices in the East India Company extortion racket. By coming forward first with the denunciations, de Glantina was briefly insulated from the scandal, because when another one of the compromised delegates came to Robespierre in mid-November with his own version of what was going on, a version that implicated de Glantina, Robespierre believed that this was just a revenge denunciation. But then at some point in late December or early January, Robespierre was handed incontrovertible proof of de Glantina’s involvement, probably the falsified paperwork he had signed. The incorruptible Robespierre was furious, doubly so, because he had been clearly duped by the slick-talking de Glantina.

[(12:11)](#!):

On January 8, Robespierre publicly denounced de Glantina in the convention, and on January 12, the corrupt poet revolutionary was arrested. But always one to embrace a guilt-by-association mentality, Robespierre could not believe that de Glantina’s corruption was the personal failing of just one man. Instead, it was proof that the indulgent faction he fronted for was compromised. Robespierre was only further convinced of their shared guilt when Danton stood up and defended de Glantina, the only member of the convention willing to do so.

[(12:46)](#!):

In Robespierre’s head, Danton could not possibly be motivated by old ties of personal loyalty. It had to be something more sinister. And then, in an unfortunate coincidence of timing, just as de Glantina’s guilt was being established, Desmoulas used the old courtelier to criticize the Committee of Public Safety and the leadership of Robespierre. So now we have a conspiratorial pattern.

[(13:13)](#!):

Now, Desmoulas had strayed over the line once before, but in that case Robespierre had merely ordered copies of the offending issue burned. But by mid-January, with the East India Company scandal swirling, word went round to the printers of Paris that the old courtelier was a dangerous thing to be caught printing. And it was only after considerable delays that Desmoulas was able to get the sixth issue published on February 3rd. And that sixth issue would also be the final issue. After just three months, the old courtelier was killed stone dead.

[(13:46)](#!):

With Robespierre now coming to believe that the indulgence were a bunch of self-serving partisans, he really started to go in for the notion that factional fighting in itself was a danger to the nation, and that everyone needed to stop the bickering, come together as one or else.

[(14:04)](#!):

As an olive branch to the ultras, Rossin and Vasson were released from jail in early February, and it was hinted to them that now would be a very nice time to take the high road and not seek reprisals. Danton tried to get in the spirit of things by publicly applauding their release. But then he undermined his own position by saying, hey, maybe we should let Deglantina out of jail, too. He’s a good guy, I swear.

[(14:29)](#!):

Then on the 5th of February, Robespierre laid out his vision for the future in a speech to the convention entitled Report on the Principles of Public Morality. Now, I’m going to set aside the details of that speech until next week when we talk more about Robespierre’s Republic of Virtue. But just to give you a heads up, as it turns out, that Republic of Virtue will only be achieved after everybody who isn’t virtuous is murdered. And that has a lot to do with what comes next. But after giving this speech, Robespierre got very, very sick, and he disappears off to bed for a month. Nobody took his advice about coming together as one in his absence.

[(15:10)](#!):

As soon as Rosin and Vasson were let out of jail, they started gearing up for a big fight. They could see the effect that the Law of 14 Fr\xc3\xa9maire was having, and saw how the Committee of Public Safety was now stifling dissent on all sides. If they didn’t act now, they might never have another chance. But unlike the past two years, when the dark days of winter helped radical forces muster sans-cula anger into political action, this time the drive to insurrection went nowhere.

[(15:43)](#!):

And it’s not that the sections of Paris weren’t getting restless. They were. As usual, there were commodity shortages in the capital. The general maximum had gone some way towards alleviating the problem of spiraling costs, but mostly it just pushed everything into a thriving black market that even the threat of the guillotine couldn’t close down. So there were street clashes regularly through February that looked eminently exploitable. So from their base in the Cordelier Club, the new Cordelier Club, Jacques Hebert and the Ultras started trying to organize yet another Paris insurrection.

[(16:18)](#!):

And that is when they discovered that by early 1794, the well of sans-cula political wrath was mostly empty.

[(16:26)](#!):

It had been sucked dry by all the decrees passed in the wake of the insurrection of September the 5th. The insurrection, ironically enough, that Hebert himself had orchestrated. Because for the average sans-cula, every decree he had ever wanted had already been enacted. The general maximum, the law of suspects, punishment for hoarding, the streamlined revolutionary tribunal, men they trusted placed on the Committee of Public Safety. And on top of all that good stuff, the convention had just passed the so-called Laws of Vontos \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the Republican Month of Vontos \xe2\x80\x94 at the end of February and beginning of March. Those laws promised to take property confiscated from suspects and \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s and redistribute it to the poor. And that is to say nothing of the payments they were all receiving for attending sectional assemblies. Now, super radicals denounced these 40 Sioux patriots who came down twice a week to pick up their checks, but it was working out exactly the way the Committee of Public Safety hoped it would. The Parisian streets were pretty well bought off. All of this made it very hard to convince the Parisians that there was a desperate need for yet another revolt.

[(17:38)](#!):

And oh, one more thing. Since taking power, all the Committee of Public Safety had done was push the Allied armies out of France, crush the Federalist uprising, and put down the Vend\xc3\xa9e insurrection. And now you want me to overthrow these guys? I’m sorry dude, but I’m actually kind of on their side now.

[(17:57)](#!):

But the Ultras pressed on. On March the 4th, they launched a new incarnation of the Friend of the People \xe2\x80\x94 obviously trying to recapture some old magic themselves \xe2\x80\x94 and then they scheduled a mass demonstration. On March the 6th, Hebert and the Ultras let a mob out of Section Marat \xe2\x80\x94 which is what they were calling the old quarterly district these days \xe2\x80\x94 to the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville. But not a single one of the other 47 Paris sections followed their lead. It was a combination of lack of interest and poor planning. So there will be no insurrection of March the 6th on the test, because it pathetically fizzled out and went home.

[(18:35)](#!):

While the Ultras found themselves unsupported from below, they also found themselves unsupported from above, because this was the moment that Collod de Bois decided it was far better to stay in power with the Committee of Public Safety than to tear it down and try to start over again. He went down to the Jacobin Club and gave another fiery speech \xe2\x80\x94 except this one was about the importance of sticking with the revolutionary authorities. Look at all the good we’ve done. Don’t throw it away just for the sake of a few crazy radicals. His speech successfully kept the Jacobin Club on the side of the Committee, and the Ultras suddenly found themselves dangerously isolated.

[(19:13)](#!):

After that, it didn’t take long for the hammer to fall. Or I guess I should say it didn’t take long for the guillotine to fall. The members of the Committee of Public Safety were all collectively re-elected on March the 10th, and then Robespierre emerged from his illness, ready now more than ever to destroy the hated Ultras.

[(19:30)](#!):

On March the 13th, Saint-Just denounced the radicals in the convention as agents of a vast foreign plot to discredit the revolution. The next day, Jacques Hebert, Vasson, and Rosson were arrested along with a dozen or so foreigners living in Paris, including the colorful Prussian on anarchist Klutz, who has been around the revolution since the early days, but who I’m just mentioning now because he’s about to get his head chopped off. This group was collectively tried from March the 21st to March the 24th on charges of fomenting insurrection, intentionally inducing famine, and plotting another prison massacre, all apparently at the behest of British Prime Minister William Pitt. They were of course all found guilty, and led straight away to the scaffold. Apparently their executions drew the largest crowd of any execution in the whole revolution. Now I’m surprised it drew better than the King’s execution, but I guess there was something thrilling about watching men who had just spent the last year calling for everyone and their mother to be shaved with the national razor to themselves get shaved by the national razor. For the next week, the Committee of Public Safety completed its liquidation of the Paris radicals. Three days after the execution, the oh-so-recently organized Revolutionary Army was dissolved. Then using its authority under the Law of 14 Fr\xc3\xa9m\xc3\xa8re, the committee purged the Paris Commune’s General Assembly of anyone it didn’t like, including its president, Pierre Gaspar Chamet, who was one of the arch-instigators of de-Christianization. He and another batch of radical sympathizers were arrested, and would subsequently be executed on April the 13th. Just like that, the Paris Commune was put under the thumb of the Committee of Public Safety. And for the first time since, let’s see, probably the flight to Varennes, the Paris Commune was subservient to the national government rather than the other way around. Once the engine of the revolution, the Paris Commune is now a broken shell of its former self. So here we are now at the end of March 1794. The terror is clearly about to start winding down, right? The Law of 14 Fr\xc3\xa9m\xc3\xa8re is in place, and most of the out-of-control representatives have been brought to heel. Jean-Baptiste Carrier, for example, has just been recalled to Paris so that he would stop doing all the terrible things he was doing in Nantes. Collo de Bois just reaffirmed his loyalty to the Committee of Public Safety. And in a fine and ironic twist, the most zealous advocates of the terror have just fallen victim to it. So this has got to be the end, right?

[(22:06)](#!):

You can’t blame everybody for thinking this at the time. But they turned out to be very wrong. In an even finer ironic twist, the execution of the Ultras turned out to usher in not the end of the terror, but the beginning of its darkest phase, the so-called Great Terror, which was run of course by the incorruptible Robespierre, following that very narrow path of virtue that only he could see. The first sign that this was not in fact the end of the terror came when the Revolutionary Tribunal turned its attention to prosecuting those implicated in the East India Company scandal. Because the Tribunal is about to cast a far wider net than the facts would possibly warrant, in a blatant attempt to catch the biggest revolutionary fish of them all, the one guy who might possibly be able to beat Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety in a fair fight, Georges Danton.

[(22:58)](#!):

On March the 16th, the head of the Committee of General Security, the head of the National Police Force, if you will, finally issued a report on the India Company scandal. And he dutifully found that a number of convention delegates and assorted speculators had indeed committed fraud on a massive scale. But Robespierre found the report too narrowly focused on the financial details. It failed to properly take into account the broader political crimes. So three days later, the Committee of General Security came out with a new report that called for a much more open-ended trial of these traitors to France.

[(23:32)](#!):

Once Hebert and the Ultras were dispatched, the defendants in the India Company trial were next up on the Revolutionary Tribunal’s docket. As the trial date approached, a debate erupted in both the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security about whether all the right suspects had been rounded up. Some wanted to keep the scope of the next trial narrowly focused on the fraud, execute the men guilty, and leave it at that. But another camp wanted to use this all as an excuse to dispose of the whole indulgent faction, and most especially their leader, Georges Danton.

[(24:08)](#!):

The swing vote in this debate was Robespierre. And though a lot of later historians are always ready to paint Robespierre as nothing but a poisonous little snake who you should always think the worst of, I, for one, am willing to believe he was genuinely conflicted about going after Danton and D\xc3\xa9moula, I think it’s well established that he pulled back from any public alliance he might have been forging with the indulgence after Deglantina was exposed. And I think it’s also well established that Deglantina’s corruption had made Robespierre very suspicious of his old allies.

[(24:40)](#!):

But Danton and D\xc3\xa9moula were not aristocratic swine, or out-of-control rabble-rousers, or mere faceless enemies of the state. However Robespierre and D\xc3\xa9moula had gone to school together as children. They were friends. Robespierre was the godfather of D\xc3\xa9moula’s son.

[(24:57)](#!):

And Danton\xe2\x80\xa6 well, it was no secret that Robespierre privately thought Danton an immoral ogre. And it was also no secret that Danton thought Robespierre a repressed little prig who needed to loosen the hell up. But neither had ever doubted the other’s revolutionary commitment. And in a couple of key moments, they had stood side-by-side when the winds were blowing really hard in the other direction. I’m thinking here of the run-up to the war with the Austrians, when Robespierre was practically the only guy to oppose war fever, and Danton was practically the only guy who would stand up and defend him.

[(25:31)](#!):

I’m also thinking about what’s just happened in the last episode. Danton had gone out on a limb by saying, look, the emergency is passed, let’s wind down the terror. He was lambasted by the rest of the Jacobin Club, but Robespierre rose to his defense. They both thought de-Christianization to be the height of folly and joined forces trying to combat it. This is all just a few months ago. I think it’s fair to say that Danton and Robespierre were not friends. But they clearly had had each other’s backs for years. So the idea of now going after Danton, arresting him, accusing him of treason, and then executing him, that cannot have been an easy idea to swallow even for somebody as heartlessly pure as Robespierre. Plus, Danton was Danton. He was a giant, a force to be reckoned with. Going after him might actually blow up in all their faces, and it would be their heads, not Danton’s, that would wind up in the basket.

[(26:28)](#!):

In March 1794, Danton and Robespierre met twice to try to hash out their differences and avert any kind of dramatic conclusion to their shared revolutionary careers. I don’t think Robespierre was yet ready to abandon Danton after the first meeting. And when he was pushed to support an arrest warrant while the trial of the Ultras was occupying everyone’s attention, Robespierre, for the moment, refused to do it.

[(26:53)](#!):

But at some point before they met for the second and final time on March 29th, Robespierre had made up his mind that Danton posed too great a threat to let Rome free. Events after the meeting progressed too quickly and were too well-prepared for the wheels to not have already been in motion. At the meeting, Danton begged Robespierre to recognize that his mind was being poisoned, and Robespierre demanded Danton denounce his old friends as proof of his commitment to the revolution. Neither really heard a word that the other was saying. But as I said, I’m pretty sure Robespierre had already begun drawing up Danton’s indictment, and this whole exercise was simply meant to lull the great ogre into a false sense of security.

[(27:36)](#!):

Initially, the plan was for Saint-Just to take to the floor of the convention on March 31st and denounce Danton and his friends, paving the way for their collective arrest. But when this was all being laid out for the members of the Committee of General Security, they shook their heads and said, holy crap, are you crazy, first arrest Danton, then denounce him. If you give that guy even a five-minute head start, he’ll kill us all. So that’s what they did. Danton was of course tipped off that an arrest warrant was being prepared, but it appears that he just couldn’t believe it was true. He was Georges Danton. Surely, of all the men in France, he was the one guy who could not possibly be accused of being a counter-revolutionary. He was the revolution.

[(28:20)](#!):

Except he wasn’t anymore. Robespierre was. And Robespierre was the one who prepared the indictment. On the night of March 30th, Danton and Desmoulas and a few of their closest associates were arrested. Also picked up were Marie-Jean-Herault de Sacheaux, the nobleman on the Committee of Public Safety Robespierre had been keeping his eyes on these past few months, and then also Danton’s old friend and recent scourge of the Bonde, General Francois Vesterman, who had come back to Paris just in time to get picked up in the sweep. The trial of Danton and his friends was of course a complete farce.

[(28:58)](#!):

Not to get off on a tangent here, but I’ve really come to love this whole historical subgenre of political show trials when the defendants refused to play the part assigned to them. When the Earl of Stratford runs circles around the long parliament, or when Charles I refuses to enter a plea and just grinds his trial to a halt, or then when the Girondins get up one by one and just eviscerate every charge levied at them. And now here we have one of the greatest shows of them all. Because if you think Danton is just going to sit back and take it, you are out of your mind. The courtroom was packed, the crowd was rowdy and ready for a show, and Danton gave it to them. The farce of it all was obvious from the beginning. All the East India Company defendants and Danton’s group would be tried together. Daimler was immediately outraged and he protested. He said, let us be sacrificed alone. What do we have to do with these rogues?

[(29:52)](#!):

When Vesterman was brought in after the others and neither asked to identify himself nor formally indicted, the General protested. When the judge shrugged and said, those are mere forms, Danton shouted out form, we’re all of us here only for form, much to the laughing delight of the audience. When the judge told him to pipe down and respect the proceedings, Danton boomed back that the judge had better respect their proceedings too. Remember, said Danton, I’m the one who created this tribunal, so I know something about it.

[(30:23)](#!):

The judge then rang his little bell that signaled for order in the court, and when the court did not return to order, the judge asked, don’t you hear the bell? And Danton barked at him, a man defending his life does not care about a damn bell. No, he keeps shouting.

[(30:39)](#!):

The prosecutors were clever though, and knowing that Danton would continue to seize the stage any chance he got, they spent the first two days of the trial focused on the boring and eminently provable crimes of the East India Company fraudsters, which gave Danton no ability to talk, since he had nothing to do with it. But on the third day, they finally had to come round to him. The problem was they didn’t really have anything on him, just a bunch of vague stuff going all the way back to the allegations that he had been too busy apologizing for General Dumourie to realize General Dumourie was plotting a coup, and then even further back that he had once been friends with the now disgraced Mirabeau, all of which Danton had very good answers for, and all of which the tribunal had no proof of any actual wrongdoing.

[(31:27)](#!):

As he parried each thrust, Danton continuously counter-demanded that he and his friends be allowed to call witnesses in their defense. Danton planned to call every member of the Committee of Public Safety, and no doubt subject them to some very uncomfortable cross-examination. These demands were repeatedly rebuffed, but it was getting hard for the judge and prosecutor to maintain order. To help speed matters along, the Committee of Public Safety seized on a report of a rumor that Damoulas’ beloved wife Lucille had been spotted at the prison where the defendants were being kept with a large amount of money, supposedly a bribe to help facilitate a prison break. Not really caring whether the story was true or not, the Committee ordered Lucille arrested on the night of April the 4th, and a decree was passed that if the defendants did anything further to insult the majesty of the tribunal, that they could be removed from the courtroom.

[(32:21)](#!):

The next day, April the 5th, 1794, Danton once again got into an argument about whether or not he could call a witness, and the judge invoked the new decree. The defendants were removed from their own trial. Especially hand-picked jurors were then asked to deliver a verdict, and they did. Without proof, witnesses, or the defendants present, they found everybody guilty of defrauding the nation and conspiring to restore the monarchy. An absurd verdict, of course, but also a final verdict.

[(32:55)](#!):

As they waited their last few minutes in the conciergery, Danton lamented the poor state he was leaving the Republic, and allegedly said, If only I could leave my balls to Robespierre and my legs to Coton, the Committee might live a little longer. At four in the afternoon, Danton, Desmoulas, Faberge de Cantina, Westermann, Heroux, some of the most dedicated, passionate, ferocious revolutionaries were led out onto the tumbrels. These were the men who had taken down the Bastille, overthrown the monarchy, sentenced the king to death, and then defended the Republic with every fiber of their being. But now it is time for the revolution to devour a few more of her children.

[(33:37)](#!):

One wonders if Faberge de Cantina contemplated lettuce on his way to the guillotine, this after all being the 16th of Germinalg, the day he had so poetically set aside for the contemplation of lettuce. Desmoulas no doubt died fearing for his arrested wife Lucille, not that she would suffer for long after his death, she herself would be executed just a week later. Georges Danton was of course the last of the group to be killed. After watching his friends die one by one, he approached the guillotine himself and told the executioner, Don’t forget to show my head to the people. It is worth a look. Then zip thud, the end.

[(34:18)](#!):

Next week, we will continue to follow Robespierre as he leads France along the razor-thin path to the Republic of Virtue, a republic that could only be forged by its evil twin, the Reign of Terror. And though his accomplice Saint-Just had just promised the convention that the execution of the indulgence would finally, finally bring an end to the political massacres, it will turn out that they were just getting warmed up.

[(01:46)](#!):

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. So last time, the Revolution ate some of her most famous children, gobbling them up at the behest of her friends on the Committee of Public Safety. According to Robespierre, their factional partisanship threatened to lead France off the narrow path to the virtuous Promised Land he clearly believed it was his destiny to lead France to. Translated into more practical language, the Ultras and the Indulgens had both posed a political threat to the dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety and thus had to be eliminated.

[(02:33)](#!):

Today we will see the Committee complete its consolidation of power, leading directly to the so-called Great Terror which ran the streets of Paris red with blood and in the process convinced a lot of people that Robespierre was not going to stop until he had killed everyone that did not meet his exacting revolutionary standards.

[(02:53)](#!):

On February 5, 1794, that is two months before Danton and his guys were executed, Robespierre had defined those exacting revolutionary standards. In a speech to the convention called Report on the Principles of Public Morality, he laid out the philosophical framework that ought to now guide government policy. He started out by saying that up until now the revolution had not been guided by any exact theory or precise rules of conduct which, yeah, tell me about it. The time had come though to finally lay some out. So he said, what is the goal toward which we are headed?

[(03:32)](#!):

The peaceful enjoyment of liberty and equality, the reign of that eternal justice whose laws have been inscribed not in marble and stone but in the hearts of all men.

[(03:43)](#!):

So what he’s talking about here is a democratic republic founded not on mere laws but rather in something deeper, psychological, and emotional. So he is moving the revolution away from Montesquieu and towards Rousseau. Then he asked them, what is the fundamental principles of popular or democratic government? That is to say, the essential mainspring which sustains it and makes it move. Now anyone who knew Robespierre even a little bit already knew what his answer was going to be. He said, it is virtue. Now luckily, being the occasionally good disciple of Rousseau that he was, Robespierre believed that virtue was natural to the people and that it was only through the corrupting influence of intriguers and despots that it was corrupted. So he said that naturally, the first rule of your political conduct should be to let all your measures tend to maintain equality and encourage virtue. For the first care of the legislator should be to strengthen the principles on which the government rests.

[(04:47)](#!):

So what Robespierre is saying is that first, we need to ensure the people are virtuous and then we can have our perfect republic. And this is radically different from the assumptions of James Madison and the founders of the American republic, who explicitly built their constitution on the assumption that men were not virtuous animals at all. And maybe that’s why they didn’t have to chop off as many heads.

[(05:10)](#!):

Robespierre then transitioned into talking about how to found this republic of virtue. Because he recognized that the tempest of the times meant that virtue alone was not enough. He said, if the mainspring of popular government in peacetime is virtue, amid revolution, it is at once virtue and terror. Virtue without which terror is fatal, terror without which virtue is impotent. Terror is nothing but prompt, severe, inflexible justice. It is therefore an emanation of virtue. So now we’re getting to the good stuff, where virtue can only be achieved when the wicked are purged from the body politic and the virtuous are scared into being anything but virtuous. But Robespierre knows what you’re about to ask, and so he asks it for you. He asks, but hasn’t it been said that terror is the spring of despotic government? Does yours then resemble despotism?

[(06:06)](#!):

Yes, Robespierre answered himself, but the government in a revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny. Is force only intended to protect crime? Is not the lightning of heaven made to blast vice exalted? He refers to the terror as the steel that glistens in the hands of the heroes of liberty.

[(06:28)](#!):

So where we’re at now is the belief that the people are naturally virtuous, that they’ve been corrupted, and what is needed is a vanguard of warriors to clear out everything standing between the people and their natural virtue, which will then manifest itself in a glorious republic of equality and liberty where the nation will secure the comfort of the individual and an individual prides himself on the prosperity and glory of his country.

[(06:53)](#!):

So Robespierre is describing like a symbiotic organism made up of pure republican virtue that will then, I guess at some point, disappear in a flash of white light up to a higher plane of existence. Or, you know, collapse under the weight of a pile of heads and then get taken over by a little corporal from Corsica, whichever comes first.

[(07:14)](#!):

Now Robespierre delivered this great speech, possibly the defining speech of his career, just before he took a month’s sick leave from the public stage. But when he came back in March, it was clearly with the republic of virtue in mind that he aimed at immediately purging those dangerous factions, which in and of themselves were evil because they divided the people from the government and the people from each other. All of it, of course, was being funded by foreign enemies, which is why it was no problem to kill them all. They were not true citizens, they were strangers, alien enemies outside the protection of even human empathy.

[(07:50)](#!):

Upon delivering the indictment of the indulgence to the convention, Robespierre’s young ally and collaborator Saint-Just promised that this would be the end of the political killings. That with this last of the factions liquidated, the process of virtuous regeneration could begin unimpeded. Now it’s hard to tell if he was lying through his teeth or just magnificently self-deluded, but whichever it was, Robespierre and Saint-Just were not going to keep that promise at all.

[(08:21)](#!):

To ensure that the virtuous regeneration continued unimpeded, the Committee of Public Safety purged the General Assembly of the Paris Commune, so that there would be one less cesspool for factionalism to spread out from. Anyone deemed insufficiently loyal to the committee was barred from taking their seats. The more prominent men of the Commune were of course arrested and executed, and in their places new, more reliable delegates were appointed\xe2\x80\x94a task handled personally by Robespierre, which will become important next week when we follow the climactic drama of the Termidorian Reaction.

[(08:59)](#!):

Following up on the purge of the Commune, Robespierre then led the Committee of Public Safety to attack another possible hotbed of factionalism. This time the target was the Committee of General Security. Now it’s easy to get these two committees confused, so just to remind you of the difference, the Committee of General Security predated the Committee of Public Safety. It had been the first stab at creating an executive council to run the country, but for a variety of reasons it didn’t work the way it was supposed to, and was supplanted by the Committee of Public Safety in March 1793.

[(09:35)](#!):

But in the power transfer, the Committee of General Security retained jurisdiction over domestic policing and the pursuit of counter-revolutionaries. It was kind of a national police force. During the consolidating moves that eventually culminated with the Law of 14 Fr\xc3\xa9maire, the Committee of General Security had been made subordinate to the Committee of Public Safety. But despite its nominal subservience, it continued to operate as its own independent thing.

[(10:04)](#!):

And given its mandate, it shouldn’t surprise you to learn that the leaders of the Committee of General Security tended to skew ultra, and a few of its leading members had been very anti-Christian and pro-terror, and thus they were now suspect in the eyes of Robespierre. So those leaders of the Committee of General Security did not miss the blatant shot across their bow fired by Robespierre on April 16th. St. Just came down to the convention to introduce a new law creating a Bureau of General Policing within the Committee of Public Safety.

[(10:41)](#!):

This new Bureau would have jurisdiction over, that’s right, domestic policing and the pursuit of counter-revolutionary suspects. Assigned to the Bureau were Robespierre, St. Just, and Georges Gouton, who now formed a pretty tight little clique within the Committee. Obviously, the intent of this new Bureau was to make the Committee of General Security redundant, and knowing Robespierre, probably as a prelude to purging and executing the suspect leaders of that Committee. All that said, it should not really come as a surprise to you that some of the prime movers of the Termidorian Reaction were those threatened leaders on the Committee of General Security.

[(11:25)](#!):

So in a way, Robespierre’s paranoia was now becoming self-fulfilling. By seeing enemies around every corner, he was making enemies around every corner. The incorruptible was starting to denounce everyone in sight. In a Committee of Public Safety meeting, he made veiled threats at Lazar Carnot, the organizer of victory who was pretty apolitical at this point.

[(11:49)](#!):

Secure in his position, Carnot scoffed at Robespierre and basically said, bring it on, little man. But feeling less secure were the two radicals on the Committee, Collot de Bois and Biovarin. With the Saint-Culot now effectively broken as a political force, these two Saint-Culot members of the Committee recognized that it might not be long before they were identified as expendable and executed.

[(12:15)](#!):

But Robespierre’s real boogeyman these days was a conspiracy that was allegedly being hatched between old allies of Danton and returning representatives on mission who had been recalled following the Law of 14th Remair. Specifically, Robespierre was worried about Joseph Fouchet, the guy who had gotten de-Christianization started. Now, I’m frankly shocked Fouchet hasn’t been arrested and executed already. He was back in Paris by early April and would have made a juicy target. But for whatever reason, he was never picked up.

[(12:49)](#!):

Now I don’t know whether there was a conspiracy between the old Danton allies and the representatives on mission before Robespierre dreamed it up, but as soon as they all got word that the virtuous little devil suspected them, well, they had better get going with a conspiracy to overthrow him or it would be all of their heads.

[(13:10)](#!):

A month later, the Committee of Public Safety made another consolidation move when they decided that the various local revolutionary tribunals that had sprouted up over the past year could no longer be trusted to implement revolutionary justice. Some were going cuckoo bananas one way and just indiscriminately slaughtering people. Others were barely doing anything. So on May the 8th, 1794, the various provincial tribunals were closed. All suspects were now to be carted into Paris to have their fate determined.

[(13:43)](#!):

But of course this decision inevitably led to, you guessed it, massive overcrowding in the Paris prisons. So almost overnight, the pressures of overcrowding needed to be addressed and addressed it soon would be. But before we get into the law of 22 prairiales and the beginning of the great terror, we need to swing back through the mind of Robespierre and deal with his fancy new religion.

[(14:10)](#!):

Now unlike the ultras who saw religion as an enemy of France, Robespierre saw religion as one of the great vehicles for the promotion of virtue. With the commune now practically under Robespierre’s personal control, it goes without saying that de-Christianization immediately ground to a halt. But Robespierre did not intend to follow this up with a re-Christianization of France. He wanted to follow it up instead by introducing a new cult that would bridge the divide between the old superstitions of Christianity and the new rationalism of the Enlightenment.

[(14:46)](#!):

So probably since the cult of reason had first burst onto the scene a few months earlier, Robespierre had been spending his free time cooking up a civic religion of his own, one that he hoped would supplant the sacrilegious atheism of Jacques Hebert and his boys, and he called it the Cult of the Supreme Being. On May 7, Georges Coton came down to the convention and announced that in one month’s time there would be a great festival of the Supreme Being. Municipalities across the country were ordered to prepare for local celebrations to coincide with the Paris launch of the new cult.

[(15:23)](#!):

With almost no notice, all those municipalities scrambled to put something together, and in one of history’s little ironies, the local leaders just went and dusted off all the old props they had used for the atheistic Festival of Reason that they had been instructed to celebrate back in October. But let’s just not tell Robespierre, okay? In Paris, meanwhile, there would obviously be no such recycling of materials, and Robespierre handed planning of the festival over to Jacques Louis David, who by now was the all-purpose art director of the French Revolution.

[(15:58)](#!):

Having stage-managed both the funeral of Marat and the festival of the unity and indivisibility of the Republic, David was getting pretty good at throwing the revolution’s theme nights, and for the Festival of the Supreme Being he attempted to outdo his own high standards. He had construction crews working round the clock building something out in the middle of the Champ de Mars, and then devised an elaborate processional to celebrate both the cult of the Supreme Being and the man who was bringing it to France, Maximilien Robespierre.

[(16:34)](#!):

On June the 4th, Robespierre was, conveniently enough, elected president of the convention, so that he could lead the official processional and give the major speeches merely because he was president of the convention, not because he was a would-be tyrant with a messiah complex. Not that at all. On June the 8th, a glorious day by the by, Robespierre stood next to one of David’s most ingenious works of public art, a giant effigy of atheism.

[(17:04)](#!):

Now everyone must have been wondering what Robespierre was delivering a speech dedicated to the Supreme Being next to a huge statue of atheism, but upon completing the speech, it all became clear. At the climax of the speech, the effigy was lit on fire, and as it burned, a second statue hidden inside the first started to emerge. Ooh, what’s that? What could it be? When the fire and smoke cleared, a great statue of wisdom was left standing in place of destroyed atheism. Everyone was suitably impressed.

[(17:38)](#!):

When the statue within the statue trick was played out, the procession moved on to the Champ de Mars. There everyone beheld what David’s construction crews had been building. It was a huge replica of a mountain built from cardboard and plaster. On top was a liberty tree, and just next to it was a 50-foot-high column anchoring the mountain, atop which was a statue of Hercules, one of David’s favorite symbols for this phase of the revolution. And this time Hercules held liberty in his hands, protecting her from danger.

[(18:14)](#!):

When everyone was gathered round, I kid you not, Robespierre descended from the mountain to deliver another stirring lecture on the glories of virtue and the republic. To borrow a phrase from Simon Schama, Robespierre was presenting himself as nothing less than Jacobin Moses. To the growing list of men who now considered Robespierre the most dangerous man in France, watching all of this unfold cannot have done anything but give them ulcers, because clearly Robespierre was moving into the direction of crazy Roman emperor land.

[(18:50)](#!):

Two days after the Festival of the Supreme Being, everyone’s ulcers got a little more acute when Saint-Just came down to the convention to deliver the latest new decree from the Committee of Public Safety. In case you’re wondering, it’s right around this period that young Saint-Just gets dubbed the Angel of Death, since he was the one who was always coming down to deliver the news to the convention that this batch of former stalwart revolutionaries were now deemed enemies of the state, or for example right now, when he came down and announced the beginning of the Great Terror. Of course, he didn’t call it the Great Terror, that’s just a label we’ve slapped on it after the fact.

[(19:29)](#!):

What Saint-Just brought down to the convention was the now infamous Law of 22 Prairie Hall. That is, June the 2nd, 1794. The law took the already streamlined revolutionary tribunal process and made it even more streamlined, if you can believe that. We’ve already seen show trials like Marie Antoinette’s bar the defendant from having counsel. But technically speaking, counsel was still allowed. Well, not anymore.

[(19:58)](#!):

And all Danton’s bluster about his right to call witnesses? He was right about that, witnesses were supposed to be a part of the process. But not anymore. The Law of 22 Prairie Hall made it virtually impossible for a defendant to, well, defend themselves. Also introduced were a fun new array of potential crimes, like slandering patriotism, spreading false news, and my personal favorite, seeking to inspire disagreement.

[(20:28)](#!):

Citizens were not only empowered to apprehend or denounce men and women guilty of these anti-patriotic crimes, but they were required to do so. Failure to come forward was proof of your own complicity, which, as you can imagine, led to an atmosphere of paranoia, mutual distrust, and hair-trigger accusations. Oh also, there would be no more middle ground. The re-re-reformed tribunal now had two possible verdicts, acquittal or death.

[(21:01)](#!):

With the prisons of Paris already overstuffed, indeed that was one of the driving forces behind the law, the newly newly reformed tribunal got to work clearing out the damned. Executions in the capital had been waning in the first few months of 1794, but in June they skyrocketed back up again. Now as I’ve mentioned previously, there are about 2,600 official victims of the terror executed in Paris. Of those, nearly two-thirds would be killed right now, in June and July 1794. And that’s why it’s called the Great Terror.

[(21:37)](#!):

But in the grand scheme of things, remember, the total number of people killed in the terror was about 16,000. About 1,500 thus represents less than 10% of the total victims. So yes, the pace quickened dramatically after 22 prairial, and had Termidor not come along and shut it down, it might have just kept accelerating. But personally, when I think of the worst of the terror, I think Lyon and Nantes and the bloodbath that immediately followed the fall of Toulon. So the label, the Great Terror, I think betrays a little bit of a Paris-centric worldview, because this was when the terror was the worst, in Paris.

[(22:20)](#!):

But the Great Terror in Paris does have one kind of cool thing going for it, cool in an extremely morbid way. The Great Terror of June and July 1794 is when the terror most resembled the standard portrayal of the reign of terror. That is, that it was a bunch of zealous Jacobin revolutionaries cutting off the heads of every damned aristocrat they could get their hands on. Now in the main, aristocrats made up a very small percentage of the total victims of the terror. Most of them have emigrated a long time ago. So it was mostly peasants from the Bonde getting beheaded, not dukes from Versailles.

[(22:58)](#!):

But during the Great Terror, whole noble families were targeted as a group and executed, their only crime really being that they were noble. During the Great Terror, aristocrats made up close to 30% of the victims, and if you threw in the extra clergymen, you’re now talking about 50% of the victims. So when the people portray the terror as a process of exterminating the nobility, kindly remind them that yes, this may have been true, but it was really only in the early summer of 1794.

[(23:32)](#!):

There’s one other super interesting thing about the Great Terror, and this super interesting thing is what I think ultimately undoes Robespierre and gets him overthrown. As we’ve seen, the bloodiness of the revolution tracks pretty well with the fortunes of the French army. Things going good out on the frontiers, no massacres. Things start going bad, well, it was the invasion of France that triggered the insurrection of August the 10th and the massacre of the Swiss guards, and then it was the imminent arrival of that allied army into Paris that triggered the September massacres.

[(24:08)](#!):

After Valmy and the push into Belgium, things were pretty cool, but then Dumourieu defected and things started turning against France, and suddenly everything went to hell again. It was the great crisis of the summer of 1793, Federalist revolt, Vend\xc3\xa9e Uprising, setbacks in Belgium, that led to the reign of terror in the first place. So you would think that if the terror is going to get ratcheted up again, that there must have been something gnarly going out on the frontier, some great defeat, some danger about to pounce. But instead, no, nothing. Things are actually going great for France. That’s what makes the great terror unique. It was emphatically not driven by some military crisis.

[(24:54)](#!):

And Robespierre’s enemies are going to be quick to point this out. So I want to end today by circling around to check in on all our various war fronts to make sure that everything is in fact cool, so that next week we’ll be able to come back to Paris and say to Robespierre, dude, there is no emergency, so lighten up, Francis. We’ll start this time out in the West with the Vend\xc3\xa9e Uprising.

[(25:21)](#!):

After the failed run to Granville marked the end of the Catholic and royal army, the Republicans settled in to brutally reassert control of the region and punish the rebels. We’ve already talked about the horrors unleashed by Jean-Baptiste Carier and his Republican baptisms, but what he was up to up and not was only a drop in the bucket compared to the bloody flood that washed across the Vend\xc3\xa9e beginning in January 1794. And I speak now of the Infernal Columns.

[(25:54)](#!):

The Infernal Columns had first been cooked up back in August 1793, when the fires of insurrection were still raging out of control. But it had taken six months to get it all organized and decide that they were really going to go through with it. Twelve army columns, numbering about 65,000 men, under the command of an otherwise innocuous general named Louis-Marie Tarot, were to march into the Vend\xc3\xa9e with a single mission, exterminate the civilian population.

[(26:28)](#!):

Now this may seem harsh, but there was a simple, if brutal, calculus at work. As many leaders throughout history who have faced a guerrilla insurgency will tell you, differentiating enemy fighter from innocent civilian is nearly impossible. They all look the same. Plus in the minds of the convention, there were no innocent civilians in the Vend\xc3\xa9e. There were men who fought, and then the families who kept those fighters fed, supplied, and hidden. They were all collectively guilty, and with the war still raging, this drastic policy that bordered on genocide seemed justifiable.

[(27:07)](#!):

With the benefit of hindsight, though, the columns getting moving in January 1794, after the Catholic and Royal Army has been beaten, beaten again, and beaten some more? Well, now it just looks like murderous, destructive revenge, and that is not a good look for anyone. The columns got rolling on January 21, 1794, and they carried out their orders. They killed men and women and children. They destroyed homes. They burned villages. They destroyed everything in their path, then they moved on and repeated the process.

[(27:44)](#!):

So just as Robespierre was droning on about the virtue of virtue, the infernal columns were cutting a truly terrifying swath through the Vend\xc3\xa9e, and the numbers are staggering. Somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000 people were killed between January and May 1794. None of those deaths are counted in the official Reign of Terror victims list, because they were not processed by any sort of tribunal. They were just killed. With guns, knives, clubs, torches, and presumably a few with bare hands.

[(28:19)](#!):

This ugly slaughter even turned the stomachs of the men carrying it out, and it is without a doubt one of the most unjustifiably horrible things that happened in a decade full of unjustifiably horrible things. After Termidor, the commander of the infernal columns, General Turel, would be arrested. But eventually, a military tribunal would acquit him of any wrongdoing because he was, after all, just following orders. A defense that no longer flies these days.

[(28:52)](#!):

But whatever moral judgment we can pass on the Republic’s policy in the Vend\xc3\xa9e, one thing is certain. In June of 1794, the region posed no immediate threat to the Republic. It was simply too busy being exterminated.

[(29:08)](#!):

Okay, so what about the other great internal threat that had faced the Republic in 1793? The Federalist Uprising. Oh, that’s right. Toulon was the last holdout, and it had been retaken by the Republic back in December. By June of 1794, federalism had been rotting in an open grave for six months. Federalism just isn’t a thing anymore. So obviously, no major emergency on that front. Okay, so having established that there were no major internal emergencies in the summer of 1794, what about along the frontiers?

[(29:44)](#!):

Well you go around, and it’s pretty much the same story. The Spanish had penetrated across the Pyrenees in 1793, but a reinforced French line had pushed them back in the spring of 1794, and then those guys would just keep rolling. By the end of the year, the French would be occupying Spanish territory rather than the other way around. And then over along the Alps, the French made an abortive push into the Piedmont, and yes, it was pushed back, but it’s not like anybody was threatening to spill over onto French soil.

[(30:15)](#!):

Now up along the Rhine, a front we haven’t actually talked about that much, things were a little bit stickier. But again, in the end, the first half of 1794 was defined by a couple of French thrusts being turned back by the Allies, not major French defeats. I will however mention that the situation on the Rhine might have actually been a major weak point for the French, had it not been for the furious and nearly superhuman energy of Saint-Juste.

[(30:45)](#!):

Just after the Girondins were executed in October 1793, Saint-Juste was dispatched to reorganize the army of the Rhine, which was apparently suffering from pretty poor morale and a general breakdown of discipline.

[(30:59)](#!):

Saint-Juste came sweeping in and whipped them all into shape, and forcing some pretty severe disciplinary measures. But unlike most military disciplinarians, Saint-Juste was actually more sympathetic \xe2\x80\x94 if that’s even the right word \xe2\x80\x94 to the enlisted troops rather than the officers. Saint-Juste listened to complaints from put-upon privates, and he had no qualms about putting an offending officer against the wall and having him shot.

[(31:29)](#!):

When the Law 14 Fr\xc3\xa9m\xc3\xa8re passed in December, the army, like everything else, now answered directly to the Committee of Public Safety. As the committee’s representative, Saint-Juste dismissed officers he deemed insufficiently energetic, and elevated two new generals of very poor lineage who would have languished in obscurity had not the Revolution and Saint-Juste intervened, Lazare Hoche and Jean Charles Pichagrou, the latter nothing more than the son of a peasant. With the army of the Rhine straightened out and under new ownership, the French spent the end of December defeating the Allied armies arrayed against them and holding the line ably.

[(32:12)](#!):

By the spring of 1794, there was another shakeup that is way too high school drama to get into, with Pichagrou denouncing Hoche and Hoche getting arrested but not executed. But the bottom line for us right now is there’s no military crisis on the Rhine frontier in June 1794. So that brings us around finally to the all-important Belgian frontier, where, far from a crisis, the French armies are about to achieve permanent ascendancy.

[(32:43)](#!):

With no prominent geographical barriers in the way, the Belgian frontier is where both sides had to concentrate their troops in the spring of 1794. The French had nearly 200,000 men facing off against about 150,000 allies. The lev\xc3\xa9 en masse, combined with the strategy of the amalgam\xc3\xa9, meant that not only were the French numerically superior, they were also not going to be slouches in the field.

[(33:10)](#!):

Also, after his work along the Rhine seemed to pay off so handsomely, Assange just did the same for the Army of the North, bringing strict discipline and a sense of energetic purpose to the French armies\xe2\x80\x94that is, when he wasn’t back in Paris handing out death sentences to the enemies of the Committee of Public Safety. The allies, for their part, had finally given up on the whole strategy of, let’s let France collapse on its own. And so they planned to open 1794 by carving out a road to Paris and then charging hard at the capital to kill the revolutionary beast once and for all.

[(33:47)](#!):

They laid siege to one of those frontier fortresses everyone was so fond of laying siege to, and they spent April successfully fending off the French attempts to relieve their fortress. But then the French opened up a whole new front away from the besieged city and scored a couple of hard-fought victories. They then suffered a tough defeat at Tournai at the end of May, but a month later, the French and allies squared off at Fleurus on June 26.

[(34:14)](#!):

The French were led by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who, since his victories back in October had actually been fired for insubordination and nearly lost his head, but he was recalled after the French defeat at Tournai, and so wound up getting the credit for one of the greatest victories of the Revolutionary Wars. The Battle of Fleurus was actually not really a French victory, so much as it was an allied admission of defeat. With their whole offensive stalling out, and the Battle of Fleurus turning into an indecisive stalemate, the allies decided to pull back, and then they kept pulling back.

[(34:50)](#!):

Clearly a decision had been made among the allied commanders that a quick plunge to Paris was no longer in the cards, and that with the French continuing to mass men and guns, that their foothold in the Low Countries was undefendable. After Fleurus, the allies evacuated Belgium, leaving it wide open for French occupation. So like I say, not only was there no crisis, but the French just won a stunning victory.

[(35:24)](#!):

Saint-Just just so happened to be present for the Battle of Fleurus, and he rushed back to Paris to personally deliver the fantastic news. But what he found when he arrived was not a united capital ready to celebrate the great victory, but instead everyone holding long knives and glowering at everyone else. And far from being yet another major feather in the cap of the Committee of Public Safety’s pretty impressive turnaround of the war effort, the victory at Fleurus and the allied evacuation of Belgium only bolstered the case of the Committee’s enemy that Robespierre had become a mad tyrant who had no justifiable reason for continuing the terror except to exterminate all his personal enemies.

Next week, they are going to strike at him before he can get to them, and they will bring Act I of the French Revolution to a final, bloody close.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.38, Termidor.

[(02:25)](#!):

So this week, we’ll mark a major milestone in the history of the French Revolution. It is in fact such a major milestone that you could make a strong argument that the Termidorian reaction marks the end of the French Revolution. It certainly marks the end of the French Revolution as a great \xe2\x80\x94 and terrible \xe2\x80\x94 social experiment that sought to reform, rebuild, and remake every aspect of France. That experiment had begun innocuously enough in May 1789, when the Third Estate demanded nothing more than a voice in government. It had then taken on a life of its own, and raced forward without \xe2\x80\x94 as Robespierre just put it \xe2\x80\x94 an exact theory or precise rules of conduct.

[(03:05)](#!):

That careening experiment culminated in the early summer of 1794, with Robespierre trying to kill his way to the Republic of Virtue. It will end today, with the rejection of the incorruptibles’ blood-soaked idealism on the fateful day of 9 Termidor, year 2.

[(03:24)](#!):

After the Termidorian reaction \xe2\x80\x94 which is what historians call it \xe2\x80\x94 the Revolution as such will become far less concerned with lofty philosophical visions. It will instead be about picking through the vast array of reforms unleashed over the past five years, permanently cementing that which worked well, tossing aside that which did not. But for the men who governed France after Termidor, there was really only two main goals \xe2\x80\x94 win the war, and stay in power. That was really it. Like the Rump Parliament from the English Revolution, the coming French Directory would sit atop a very narrow base of support, predicated almost entirely on military victory. They would annul election results they didn’t like, put down popular uprisings by force, and always, always keep an eye out for the next potential threat to their power. So the coming second act of the French Revolution will be more cynical, less idealistic, and ultimately be remembered by history as little more than the furnace within which Napoleon Bonaparte was forged.

[(04:28)](#!):

But like so many other glossed-over periods of history that seem to serve as mere preludes to the next big thing, the second half of the 1790s is rich in drama. The next five years will see multiple uprisings from counter-revolutionary royalists, far-left proto-communists, and terminally embittered former Jacobins trying to reclaim control of the revolution that had slipped from their grasp. So the French Revolution is far from over. I mean, we haven’t even gotten to Gracchus-Babouf and the conspiracy of equals yet. And how can you tell the whole story of the French Revolution without Gracchus-Babouf?

[(05:05)](#!):

But before we move on to Act II, we need to bring the curtain down on Act I, and we left off last time with the stage set for today’s dramatic climax.

[(05:14)](#!):

Robespierre’s ego and paranoia were expanding so rapidly that a group of men who otherwise had very little in common were being united by the shared threat posed by the incorruptible. The first sign that there might actually be a real backlash against Robespierre came just after the passage of the Law of 22 Prairie Hall. Members of both the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security were not at all happy about the way the law had been introduced. Crafted by Robespierre and Georges Coton, no one else had been allowed to see it before it was introduced to the convention. Annoyed and not a little unnerved about being cut out of the loop on such an important piece of legislation, the Committee of General Security pointedly refused to act when Robespierre then gave them a list of nine men he believed were engaged in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. And perhaps more importantly, this refusal to act was supported by some of Robespierre’s colleagues on the Committee of Public Safety. So just two months after the committees had closed ranks in mutual solidarity to put down the ultras and the indulgence, the rift between Robespierre and everyone else was threatening to break them all apart again.

[(06:26)](#!):

For the rest of June 1794, Robespierre’s enemies laid the groundwork for a move against him. Now as I said last time, I don’t know whether there really was a conspiracy between all these guys before Robespierre started to suspect that there was, but there certainly was after Robespierre started to suspect that there was.

[(06:45)](#!):

As a prelude for our far more cynical post-Terminatorian revolution, the link between the conspirators had nothing to do with ideology or class or belief system. It had to do with the fact that they were all personally afraid of what Robespierre might do to them if he was left to his own devices. So the coup of 9 Termidor was not about overthrowing the tyranny of the Committee of Public Safety and ushering back in the idealistic and democratic constitution of 1793. It was about a bunch of guys trying to stay alive for one more day.

[(07:18)](#!):

The most prominent of the conspirators were drawn from the ranks of those recalled representatives on mission. Specifically Joseph Fouch\xc3\xa9, the arch de Christianizer and accomplice of Collo de Bois in Lyon. Then also a 24-year-old named Jean-Lambert Talion, who had been the representative sent to deal with Bordeaux during the Federalist revolt. Talion was suspicious not because his brand of terror had been too harsh, but because it had been too lenient. He had started out ruthlessly executing Girondin allies in Bordeaux, but then he fell in love with the former wife of an \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 nobleman, and she used her influence to get Talion to practically stop using the guillotine altogether.

[(08:02)](#!):

Another of the conspirators who deserve special mention at this point is Paul Barras, who had been the representative down in Marseille and is about to go on to be the main executive force in the French Directory, so we’ll be talking a lot about Barras in the episodes to come. Including the ex-representatives in the scheming were three other groups aligning against Robespierre. First were the men who had once been associated with the purged ultras. Specifically that meant the Committee of General Security, practically as a whole institution, and then the two sans-culottes members of the Committee of Public Safety, Collo de Bois and Biovarin.

[(08:41)](#!):

Second, there was anyone who had ever been on friendly terms with Danton, none of whose names you need to know right now, so let’s not worry about them. And then third, the war technocrats like Lazard Carnot, who were getting sick of the aggressive busy-bodying of Robespierre, and then especially Saint-Just, who was starting to fancy himself a military genius who could easily take over the War Department if Carnot had to be discarded.

[(09:08)](#!):

The conspiracy against Robespierre took its first baby steps out into the light when the Committee of General Security was alerted to the recent rantings of an infamous religious nut named Katerine Teo. Teo had a history of religious kookery dating back to the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, but of late she had been telling her followers that Robespierre was one of the two prophesized messiahs and that he was the herald of the last days.

[(09:36)](#!):

Robespierre’s enemies on the Committee of General Security gleefully launched an investigation of Teo, allegedly looking for evidence that she was a paid foreign agent, but mostly it was an excuse to publicly ridicule Robespierre for his messianic pretensions. But then Robespierre kind of played into their hands when he intervened with the prosecutor of the Revolutionary Tribunal and told him in no uncertain terms that the potentially embarrassing trial of Katerine Teo was not going to be moving forward. By the sheer weight of his personal influence, Robespierre got the trial canceled, but at the cost of now appearing more than ever to be aiming at dictatorship.

[(10:17)](#!):

As the conspiracy grew, tensions both inside the Committee of Public Safety and then between the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security got worse. Collo Dubois and Biavarin had both clearly become convinced that Robespierre had it in for them, and at a committee meeting on June the 26th, both denounced Robespierre as a tyrant, leading Robespierre to such a shaking rage that he boycotted all future meetings of the committee. After this, he rarely leaves his apartment. He stops attending committee meetings. He stops attending sessions of the convention. His only infrequent public appearances came at his beloved Jacobin Club, where he could always expect a warm reception.

[(11:00)](#!):

Often, this withdrawal is portrayed as Robespierre succumbing to hubris and pique, but I’ve also seen it suggested that he actually suffered a nervous breakdown at this point, and I for one am certainly ready to believe that some part of Robespierre’s brain cracked in early 1794 from nervous exhaustion. He was sick and unavailable for all of February. He disappeared from view for a few weeks just after the trial of Danton, and now here he is again withdrawing from the public stage at a critical moment in his life and career.

[(11:33)](#!):

Robespierre had always been a prescient voice of reason and a superb political tactician, but that rationality and clarity of thought are clearly deserting him here by the end, and I think it’s perfectly plausible that Robespierre was not just being an overly sensitive egomaniac here, that he really was starting to crack up mentally. Now, one thing that helped add to Robespierre’s stress level and his reclusive paranoia was a couple of alleged assassination attempts. Back on May the 22nd, a disgruntled state employee whose department had been shuttered by the revolution’s administrative reforms staked out a spot on a street near the Tweelery Palace carrying two pistols.

[(12:15)](#!):

When Robespierre’s colleague, Collo Dubois, came walking by, the would-be assassin jumped out and fired his two pistols at point-blank range, but both misfired and the guy was quickly apprehended. But the rumor went around that the guy had actually wanted to kill Robespierre and had just accidentally targeted the wrong man. Then, the very next day, a 16-year-old girl named Cecile Renaud came banging on Robespierre’s door and made such a fuss about getting in that she was detained and searched. I mean, memories of Charlotte Corday were still fresh in everyone’s mind. And out came two small daggers.

[(12:54)](#!):

When questioned, the girl was apparently a bit incoherent and babbled a bunch of nonsense, saying at one point that she only wanted to see what a tyrant looked like. And it’s entirely possible that the girl was mentally disturbed. But whether she was really an assassin or not, both the incidents had to put Robespierre’s own mental health, already a bit shaky, on even shakier ground. And he really does turn into a recluse for his last two months on Earth.

[(13:23)](#!):

Meanwhile, out in the world, the cracks in the dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety continued to widen. One of the major problems was that the legitimacy of the committee system itself was being called into question. Or rather, it seemed like the emergency committee had served its intended purpose. When it may be time to say thanks a lot, let’s move on.

[(13:45)](#!):

With so much good news coming in on the various war fronts, all domestic and foreign threats seem to have been neutralized. I mean, my God, the Austrians just evacuated Belgium. And by Robespierre’s own logic, didn’t that mean it was time to move away from a government that would be revolutionary until the peace? Wasn’t it time to abandon the emergency dictatorship and resurrect the long-delayed Constitution of 1793?

[(14:11)](#!):

The other major problem was that the Great Terror was making everyone in Paris equal parts nervous and ashamed about what was going on. The authorities had already had to move the guillotine off the Place de la R\xc3\xa9volution to a spot east of the city, where the Place Bastille is now, and then move it further east again after residents complained of the blood and the stench.

[(14:33)](#!):

Executions were no longer a glorious public celebration. They had become a grim and mechanical daily routine that just wasn’t much fun anymore. No one was enthusiastic when Cecile Renaud and her entire family\xe2\x80\x94mother, father, sisters, brothers\xe2\x80\x94were let off en masse to be killed for their role in this alleged plot to kill Robespierre. And it was really to no one’s great rejoicing when, on July 17th, a herd of old, pious Carmelite nuns were let off for the crime of living together communally. When a child pickpocket was led up to the scaffold, the sympathetic onlookers started shouting, no more children! So what was the point of all this? None of it seemed necessary. On July 23rd, the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security met in a joint session, and they tried to patch up their creaky partnership.

[(15:29)](#!):

With Robespierre out of the room, Rapprochement very nearly succeeded. The incorruptibles’ two closest allies, Saint-Just and Coton, both seemed amenable to some kind of deal being worked out to keep everyone working in harmony. But the next day, Robespierre decided to come out of hiding and make it plain that there would be no papering over their differences. The Republic of Virtue could not be founded if the wicked were allowed to live and the virtuous were forced to compromise themselves. He made such a fuss about not being willing to give an inch that the talks broke down.

[(16:03)](#!):

But though things were looking like the committees were about to break apart, Saint-Just set to work on a speech he planned to deliver to the convention in a few days, saying, don’t believe the rumors, we’re all cool, everything is cool. But everything was not cool. On July 26th, Robespierre once again emerged from seclusion to give a major address to the convention, one designed to remind everyone that the danger had not passed, that the stakes were still high, and that letting down our guard now would be fatal.

[(16:35)](#!):

In the speech, Robespierre denounced yet another foreign power-backed conspiracy, and in his black-and-white way, described the conspirators as inhuman monsters, while he himself was an honest and humble servant of the people. But as he painted a picture of the conspiracy working against me \xe2\x80\x94 I mean France \xe2\x80\x94 there were two things that started to super trouble the members of the convention who listened. First, Robespierre was going into pretty good detail about the nature of the plot \xe2\x80\x94 financial shenanigans seemed to be a big part of it. So it was clear that he was not just blowing smoke, he was talking about something concrete.

[(17:14)](#!):

But second, he was not naming any names. Well, he did name one guy, Pierre-Joseph Cambon, the state treasurer, who was considered by most people to be a diligent and independent minister. But aside from the rather odd fingering of Cambon, the rest of the conspiracy remained a faceless mob, which meant that anyone might be on Robespierre’s list, or be close enough to somebody on the list that they would get caught up in a guilt-by-association purge. So this special blend of specific vagueness was deeply unsettling to everyone in the hall.

[(17:52)](#!):

When Robespierre wrapped up his speech, everyone dutifully applauded, and then turned to what should have been a pro forma debate about whether to publish and distribute the speech. Publishing and distributing major speeches was routine, and Robespierre’s major addresses were always sent to the printer. But as soon as he was finished, a real debate broke out, engineered by Fouche and Talion, with help from Collot de Bois, who sat in the president’s chair and decided who could speak and who could not. Robespierre was attacked for his vague fearmongering. Delegates started coming forward and demanding he name names, and if he couldn’t, then maybe he should just zip it.

[(18:31)](#!):

Robespierre was shocked by this affront to his dignity. An open war might have broken out right then and there, but other convention leaders looking to avert that open war wrapped up the session before things could get out of hand. But really, things were already out of hand. That night, Robespierre took the same speech to the Jacobin Club, where he was greeted by enthusiastic applause. This was more like it. Then in a reverse of the morning’s attack on Robespierre, the Jacobins started rising to denounce Collot de Bois and Biot-Varenne. Both of whom were present that night.

[(19:07)](#!):

Couton moved that the two should be expelled from the Jacobins, and I can’t tell if they were formally kicked out or not, but they were definitely driven out of the hall. And now it was their turn to be furious about this affront to their dignity.

[(19:21)](#!):

The two returned to the meeting room of the Committee of Public Safety to plan their next move, and there they found Saint-Just hard at work on a speech he planned to deliver to the convention the next morning. Now, ironically, this speech was the one that was supposed to reassure everybody that the committees were all working in harmony. But Collot and Biot couldn’t help but believe that Saint-Just was working on a mass denunciation. The specific indictment meant to follow up on Robespierre’s vague threats. Because delivering those indictments was what the Angel of Death did best, right?

[(19:56)](#!):

So there was really no time to lose. Those who feared the coming wrath of Robespierre had better strike first, because they would not likely be given the chance to strike second. The conspirators stayed up all night plotting. Everything finally came to a head the next morning. July the 27th, 1794, aka 9 Termidor, Year 2. One of the most famous dates in the whole history of the French Revolution. A Robespierre was on hand at the convention to hear the speech Saint-Just had written. But Saint-Just had barely gotten warmed up when Talyan interrupted the speech and launched into a planned denunciation of Robespierre.

[(20:39)](#!):

Famously, at this crucial moment, the always quick-witted, sharp-tongued, and eternally self-confident Saint-Just was at a loss for words. He had clearly not expected to be ambushed like this. So instead of cutting down Talyan with some counter-denunciation of his own, Saint-Just stood silently at the podium and tacitly seated the floor to Robespierre’s enemies.

[(21:04)](#!):

Watching this unfold to his horror, Robespierre himself leapt up and tried to defend himself, but he was barred from taking the podium by Collot de Bois. As he stewed angrily, catcalls started raining down. Someone called out, look, the blood of Danton chokes him. And in the one official quote we get from Robespierre that day, his last recorded words in the convention were, Danton? Is it then Danton you regret? Cowards, why did you not defend him?

[(21:36)](#!):

Robespierre never got a chance to take the podium and officially fight back. With laughter and abuse now being heaped on top of him from all sides, someone moved that Robespierre be arrested, and then someone else moved that his closest friends ought to be arrested too.

[(21:51)](#!):

So before they could do anything about it, Robespierre, Saint-Just, Georges Couton, Robespierre’s brother Augustin, the man who would help promote young Captain Bonaparte, and then a guy named Philippe Francois Joseph Labat, who was a tight confidant of Saint-Just, were all arrested. Also slated for arrest was Francois Henriault, the guy who had been in command of the Paris National Guard since the insurrection of May 31st, June 2nd, and who was a close friend of Robespierre.

[(22:21)](#!):

Word of this dramatic turn of events took no time at all to travel down to the General Assembly of the Paris Commune, and they sprang into action. Remember, the Commune had just been purged, and all the new members had been personally appointed by Robespierre, so the Commune was in his pocket. The toxin bells rang out to alert the sections that they needed to rise up, and then Henriault went down personally to the convention to assess the situation, whereupon he was arrested and held in custody. The other prisoners had already been taken to the meeting room of the Committee of General Security, where they were going to be held until the convention could figure out what to do with them.

[(23:00)](#!):

In the meantime, the sections of Paris rallied though Del de Ville, preparing for yet another armed march to cow the national government into submission. Except, that’s right, the Commune is not the power it had once been, nor the sections as driven and united of purpose as they had once been. Of the 48 sections, only 13 sent armed companies to the Hotel de Ville. The others? Well, as we’ll see in a moment, the other sections have basically switched sides.

[(23:31)](#!):

But enough men did muster to have a go at freeing the prisoners. They marched down to the convention, but discovered in the ensuing standoff that only Henriault was actually inside. The Committee of General Security had tried to quickly disperse the other prisoners to different jails across Paris.

[(23:48)](#!):

So to counter this move, the Commune sent out orders to all the city prisons not to open their doors, and the jailers, who were evidently more loyal to the Commune than to the convention, uniformly blocked the doors, and intimidated the agents of the convention into releasing Robespierre and his friends. That’s presumably what happened, because the next thing you know all the prisoners are free and rendezvousing at the Hotel de Ville. In response to this news, the convention passed a decree declaring the prisoners outlaws, a formal designation that meant legally all you had to do was positively identify somebody and they could be executed without trial.

[(24:30)](#!):

Now at this moment, things really could have gone either way, and back at the convention, the armed mob outside had proven itself intimidating enough to secure the immediate release of Henriault. But this was the high point of the day for them. Henriault could plainly see that he did not have a strong enough force to maintain the siege of the convention, especially because he had heard that the convention was in the process of raising a street army of its own, this one drawn from the central and western sections of Paris, the ones who had not heeded the Commune’s toxin barrels.

[(25:03)](#!):

So Henriault decided to lead his little army back to the Hotel de Ville to prepare for a showdown on their own home turf. The convention appointed Paul Barras to lead the men flocking to the convention’s banner, but it took him the whole rest of the day to gather up and organize the volunteers.

[(25:22)](#!):

Meanwhile, as the convention’s forces grew, the Commune’s forces were melting away. The turnout that morning had been lackluster from the get-go, and those few men who had shown up and marched on the convention could tell that this was not going to end well for them if they stuck around. So as night descended, they prudently slipped back home one by one. Every time Henriault looked up, he had fewer men at his disposal. Finally, at 2am on July 28th, Barras marched his men on the Hotel de Ville. When they got there, the place was all but undefended and the capture of everyone inside a foregone conclusion.

[(26:03)](#!):

The scene inside and outside the Hotel de Ville that night is the stuff of tragic, depressing nightmares. It’s really like something out of a horror movie. Augustine Robespierre tried to escape out a window, but as he was shimmying along a ledge, he lost his footing. The onlookers outside saw him fall three stories to the ground, shattering both his legs. As he lay in agony, the convention forces pushed their way inside, and the first thing they found was Georges Couthon, broken and bloody at the bottom of a staircase. He had somehow gotten tipped out of his wheelchair, and he lay in a busted heap on the floor, alive, but similarly in agony.

[(26:44)](#!):

Meanwhile upstairs, Le Bar had managed to smuggle in two pistols. He gave one to Robespierre, and then used the other to shoot himself in the head. Robespierre then almost certainly took the other pistol and tried to commit suicide himself, but with no experience handling a gun, and his nerves no doubt shot, Robespierre botched the attempt. All he managed to do was blow off half his jaw.

[(27:11)](#!):

When the convention forces burst in, they found him too on the ground, writhing in agony. And then hours later, somebody finally found Henriault. Like Augustine Robespierre, Henriault had tried to escape out a window, but also like Augustine, he had fallen three stories into an open sewer, and he lay there for three hours before somebody finally discovered him. He begged to be simply finished off, but instead his broken and filthy body was taken into custody. Only Saint-Just managed to survive this with even a shred of dignity. He had been in the room with Robespierre and Le Bar, but he simply stood there stoically as he awaited his arrest and certain death.

[(27:55)](#!):

The bloody and half-conscious Robespierre was taken to the meeting room of the Committee of Public Safety, and he was laid out on a table. The consensus seemed to have been that he was not going to survive the night, so they just left him there to suffer. It was not until dawn, when they realized he was probably not going to die, that a doctor came in and had the decency to at least tie up the hanging jog with a handkerchief.

[(28:20)](#!):

Now because they were all outlaws, there would be no trial for the condemned. But rather than killing them as quickly as possible, the carts did not come round to collect them until late in the day. In the meantime, the agents of the convention had been busy rounding up the other hardcore Robespierreists, and when the tumbrels finally did come round, it was twenty-two total men who were loaded up and taken away. But to their own probable surprise, the prisoners were carted off to the Place de la R\xc3\xa9volution, because for this particular execution, the committees had decided to move the guillotine back to its original spot.

[(28:57)](#!):

At around seven that night, the execution process started up, and it had to have been a pathetic spectacle. Henriot was still only half-conscious, and he had to be dragged up to the scaffold. Georges Coton had been strapped to a plank and was in considerable pain before Madame la Guillotine made it all better. Saint-Just was again one of the only ones who managed a dignified exit, but no pithy final words for the Angel of Death. Just zip, thud, the end. Robespierre was saved for last. Though in what still had to have been an insane amount of pain, he was able to walk up the stairs to the guillotine.

[(29:38)](#!):

But his final moments are just terrible. The executioner decided that the handkerchief holding Robespierre’s jaw in place might interfere with the blade, so he unceremoniously ripped it off. Robespierre let out an excruciating scream that was only silenced by the falling blade. So good luck trying to sleep tonight.

[(30:01)](#!):

The next day, 83 more so-called Robespi\xc3\xa8res, mostly members of the Paris Commune General Assembly, were arrested and executed, making this particular bloody purge the bloodiest purge of them all. Hopefully, maybe now the final purge to end all purges? Hopefully? Maybe?

[(30:24)](#!):

In retrospect, 9 Termidor year 2 was a watershed. The fall of Robespierre led to a significant redirecting of the course of the Revolution. All the recently-accrued powers of the Committee of Public Safety were going to be stripped away. All the ideological excesses of the past year would be drawn back from. No more de-Christianization. No more civic cults. No more attempts to force people upon pain of death to be what they were not.

[(30:52)](#!):

When Lazare Hoche finally comes along and puts out the last brushfires in the Vend\xc3\xa9e in 1796, he will not do it with Republican baptisms and infernal columns. He will do it instead with conciliation and understanding. And of course, more immediately, 9 Termidor marks the official end of the Reign of Terror.

[(31:13)](#!):

Not that this was the end of political executions, not by a long shot, but the days of mass murder as the foundation of public policy are over. But the men and women of France did not know at the time that this is how it was going to go. They did not know which direction the Revolution was going to take next. They were going to have to figure all of that out for themselves. So next week, we will take our first steps out into the light of the Termidorian regime, because the men left standing try to figure out what the hell happens next.

Now next week is going to be a bit of a shorter show than usual, due to some time constraints in my work schedule, but it’ll be a good opportunity to lay the groundwork for Act 2 of the French Revolution.

Now this time, I’m going to go back a revolution and recommend a book that I was reminded of when we were on the American Revolution tour, Washington’s Crossing by David Hackett Fisher. Fisher is a brilliant historian who dug through all the intricate details of the Battle of Trenton and produced a wonderful narrative of that all-important day. Praise be to the 14th Continentals. And yes, Washington was almost certainly standing up when he crossed the river, even if he maybe wasn’t looking quite so mythically resolute. So when you’re done with this episode, go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash revolutions so that they know who sent you. Hello and welcome to Revolutions.

Episode 3.39, The Death of the Jacobins. Last week, the fever finally broke. Robespierre’s uncompromising and murderous pursuit of virtue finally lined up too many of the unvirtuous against him. The incorruptible had succeeded in never being corrupted, but it had cost him his life.

[(01:57)](#!):

But as we discussed last time, it’s not like the men who conspired to overthrow Robespierre had some grand plan for what happened next. Their grand plan hadn’t seen past keeping their heads firmly attached to their necks. And there was a general sense that the terror needed to be ended. But other than that particular goal, the men who led France after the fall of Robespierre \xe2\x80\x94 collectively dubbed the Termidorians \xe2\x80\x94 did not have a formal program. The revolution was back to moving along without an exact theory or precise rules of conduct.

[(02:28)](#!):

To begin with, it wasn’t even clear what the immediate impact of liquidating the Robespierreists would be. For a few on the Committee of Public Safety, the assumption was that it would have little effect on the actual structure of government. The committee system had already survived a number of purges, including the purge of the indulgence which had consumed one of their own colleagues in H\xc3\xa9rode des Hacheaux. So didn’t the deaths of Robespierre and Coton and St. Just just mean that there were now three more openings on the committee that needed to be filled? I mean, yes, of course, we’ll investigate the continued necessity of the Law of 22 Prairial, but other than that, I mean, it’s business as usual, yeah?

[(03:05)](#!):

But among the delegates of the National Convention, this seemed like a golden opportunity to wind back everything and undo the Committee of Public Safety’s mass consolidation of power, a consolidation process that had been ongoing since the summer of 1793. All the dire emergencies that had led the convention to entrust the Committee of Public Safety with all power in the first place were visibly receding, and it now seemed like the greatest danger to France was actually an all-powerful anything. So the convention set about dismantling the dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety.

[(03:41)](#!):

One of the leading Termidorians, Jean-Lambert Tallien, he was the former representative to Bordeaux who came under suspicion because he fell in love with the wife of an \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9, he got up in the convention and moved that henceforth one quarter of the committee’s membership would be rotated out every month, and that when those committee members rotated out, they would be ineligible for immediate re-election. That alone would keep any one man or clique from hoarding power. Tallien himself was then elected to fill one of the vacancies on the Committee of Public Safety, and from this position, he and his allies started dismantling the committee from the inside.

[(04:19)](#!):

The first step, of course, was ending the great terror. On August 1st, the Reform Committee recommended repealing the Law of 22 Prairie Hall, and the convention voted overwhelmingly in favor, no doubt with a great deal of relief that they had all lived to see this day.

[(04:36)](#!):

Then to make sure that it stuck, on August 10th, the convention reformed the Revolutionary Tribunal. Those complicit in the great terror were forced out and replaced with a cohort of far more reasonable men. These new leaders of the tribunal were instructed to convict defendants only if counter-revolutionary intent could be truly proved. This being nearly impossible, unless you were a complete doofus about your plotting, the rate of conviction plummeted. In July, there had been 935 executions in Paris. In August, there were just six. And for the rest of 1794, only 40 more people would be guillotined in the capital. The reign of terror was over.

[(05:20)](#!):

As the tribunal ceased to be the draconian murder machine it had been transformed into, the convention turned to the overcrowded prisons, wondering how many of those prisoners even needed to face the Reform Tribunal at all. With the Law of 22 Prairie Hall repealed, the vague denunciations that had landed most of the prisoners in jail were recognized as not being nearly enough to justify continuing to hold them. So the authorities started walking through the prisons and just kind of opening the doors. 3,500 men and women were released in the month of August alone. And eventually, one of the most famous prisoners released in all this was none other than our old friend Tom Paine. Arrested basically because most of his French friends had been Girondins, Paine was famously slated to be executed in July 1794 and only survived because Robespierre was killed before he was. Now Paine would have to sit around until November 1794 before he was finally cleared and let go, but by then, the prisons were nearly empty.

[(06:22)](#!):

Out in the departments, it took a little while to disseminate, but when it did, it was greeted enthusiastically. Now for the most part, the terror had already been transferred up to Paris, but a few exceptions had been made, particularly out in the West, where life was cheap and the Republic’s vengeance boundless. So the last spur of the terror took place over July and August in the departments, as just over 300 final victims were fed to Madame Lacquiotin. But by September, every important department was given a new, new representative on mission, one forbidden to stay longer than three months, and one who had orders to dismantle the apparatus of the terror.

[(07:01)](#!):

Local revolutionary watch committees were closed down, and like in the capital, the prisons were emptied. With the threat of the terror lifting, all these ex-prisoners and their friends and neighbors and relatives got together and started talking very bitterly amongst themselves about what had just happened to all of them. And as we will see in the episodes to come, it will not take long for the persecuted to become the persecutors.

[(07:28)](#!):

In the midst of this drawback from the terror, Paris exuberantly celebrated the second anniversary of the insurrection of August the 10th. This was in marked contrast to another anniversary that had just come and gone virtually uncelebrated in the capital the month before, because July the 14th of 1794 was the fifth anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. But under the shadow of the great terror, the day was far too associated with disgraced former revolutionaries like Lafayette, to say nothing of the overthrown king, for anyone to want to acknowledge July the 14th as anything special.

[(08:03)](#!):

A few fraternal banquets had been held, but those who partook did so at their own peril, as the Revolutionary Watch Committees took sinister note of anyone who participated. So though there was little in the way of official pageantry to celebrate August the 10th, the people of Paris spontaneously came out to throw a citywide party. The private Sword of Damocles that had been hanging over each of their heads had finally been cut down. The reign of terror was over. Let’s have a drink. With the terror being dismantled, the convention then voted to reorganize its committees on August the 24th. The Committee of Public Safety was stripped of its omnipotence over the entire governmental apparatus.

[(08:45)](#!):

But it was not abolished completely. It retained its jurisdiction over war and foreign affairs, the two things everyone agreed it had been doing really super well. The rest of the committee’s powers were distributed to 16 newly formed committees that would each have jurisdiction over this or that aspect of public policy. The Committee of General Security was also kept around as a national police bureau, but its powers were circumscribed, and its membership rotated just like that of the Committee of Public Safety.

[(09:14)](#!):

The General Administration of Law and Justice was then vested in the Legislative Committee, a committee that had been around as long as the other two, but had obviously atrophied into nothing since the summer of 1793. It was now vested with greater power, and rose up to take its place alongside public safety and general security as one of the main committees of the Termidorian Convention. But none of those committees were anywhere close to all-powerful.

[(09:43)](#!):

But there was a limit to how far the convention was willing to go in all this. The political situation in Paris was deeply muddled, and the delegates quite rightly feared that if they went too far, they might spark another populist insurrection. So when somebody moved on August 29th, did some of the more radical members of the old committees be indicted for their previous role in the terror, the convention declined. And then, in an utterly cynical bid to convince the Paris streets that the Termidorian Convention still carried on the legacy of the revolution, they decided to finally disinter the utterly disgraced Mirabeau from the Pantheon. To replace him, they ordered the remains of Jean-Paul Marat dug up so that the friend of the people could be given pride of place in the Pantheon. So yeah, you would have thought that it was in the immediate aftermath of Marat’s assassination that he would have replaced Mirabeau in the Pantheon. I mean, that was, after all, when revolutionary populism was in full swing, and when the Committee of Public Safety and the convention were really trying to co-opt the Saint-Cue lot.

[(10:44)](#!):

But no, it is here. In the midst of the Termidorian reaction that Marat was moved, and this is also by the by when Rousseau was dug up and moved into the Pantheon, both nakedly cynical bids to cover up the fact that the convention was very much swinging to the right. But it’s not like the left-wing populace and Jacobins couldn’t see where this was all heading. Because by the beginning of September, something resembling a genuine political right-wing was emerging in Paris \xe2\x80\x94 a right-wing that was not immediately crushed.

[(11:18)](#!):

After 9 Thermidor, new newspapers began to enter the publishing market, and they advocated some pretty startlingly anti-revolutionary principles. And we’re not talking about Demoulin’s not-extreme-enough leftism. I’m talking about open attacks on the Saint-Cue lot rabble and their treacherous Jacobin masters. When the Jacobin Club protested at the convention and demanded the new papers be suppressed, Talion stood up and quoted the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Quote, The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom.

[(11:57)](#!):

The convention not only refused to act, but the men calling for censorship were denounced as terrorists who wanted to go back to the days of indiscriminate bloodshed. Then into this newly conservative political atmosphere, a new brand of street fighter emerged with the secret \xe2\x80\x94 and at times not-so-secret \xe2\x80\x94 encouragement of the leading Termidorians. These were the Muscadins, and I’m going to use the conventional English pronunciation for that. This means literally the ones who wore musk perfume. They were also called the Gilded Youth, and as I personally like to call them, the Fightin’ Dandies. They were quite literally the opposite of the Saint-Cue lot. The Muscadins dressed in fancy clothes \xe2\x80\x94 fancy clothes that all on their own would have made these young men targets for the Revolutionary Tribunal just a few months earlier. And indeed, many of them had been targeted by the Revolutionary Tribunal, and a huge core of their membership came from prisoners released after Termidor. They were angry, bitter, and looking for revenge against the loathsome underclasses. So these angry, fancy young men would roam the streets of Paris targeting anyone associated with the terror, and deliver unto them beatings with staffs and canes that the Muscadins laughingly referred to as their constitutions. By mid-September, there were somewhere between two and three thousand Muscadin hooligans cracking skulls around Paris.

[(13:26)](#!):

Now when these kids spontaneously appeared on the scene, their good work was openly applauded by a convention delegate, journalist, and former representative on mission named Louis-Marie Freron. But Freron was not satisfied with mere cheerleading, and in no time he was actively coordinating Muscadin activities. Now Freron himself had once been a radical Jacobin, exactly the kind of guy he was now directing his gilded youth to go beat the crap out of.

[(13:57)](#!):

When the revolution got going, he had set himself up as a left-wing journalist in the old Cordelier district, and he had collaborated with Camille de Moulin and Jean-Paul Marat. He had been on the front lines of the August the 10th insurrection, and had been one of the most vocal proponents of and apologists for the September massacres. He had wound up a representative on mission down to Marseille and Toulon alongside Paul Barras, and so he was of course one of those recalled representatives menaced by Robespierre, and thus he had become a Termidorian conspirator.

[(14:31)](#!):

Sensing a distinct change in the revolutionary winds, Freron now restyled himself as an opponent of the uncouth rabble. He and the other Termidorian leaders recognized that the Muscadins represented a potent force that they could use to beat the radicals and the Jacobins down, and the Muscadins were happy to oblige.

[(14:51)](#!):

The general turn toward the right was aided by a group of alleged federalists from Nantes who were brought before the revolutionary tribunal. The charges against them quickly became far beside the point \xe2\x80\x94 and they were all acquitted anyway \xe2\x80\x94 because these guys brought with them eyewitness accounts of the Republican baptisms and the mass executions organized by Jean-Baptiste Carri\xc3\xa8re.

[(15:14)](#!):

Now it’s unclear who exactly knew what was going on in Nantes when it was going on. Certainly the Committee of Public Safety knew all about it, but I don’t know about the convention’s level of knowledge as a whole. But for sure, it was not public knowledge, aside from a few rumors. The revelations about the atrocities in Nantes turned Paris further against the Jacobins, who were now collectively held responsible for all the horrors of the previous year.

[(15:41)](#!):

The convention quickly launched an investigation into Carri\xc3\xa8re’s activities, and then pivoted into a full-frontal assault on the Jacobin Club. The convention passed a law on October 16 that required all popular societies and clubs to post a list of their membership and then forbade them from corresponding with each other.

[(16:01)](#!):

Now, this obviously exposes the cynicism of the Terminorians. I mean, just a few weeks earlier, Talion had been singing the hymn of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the freedom of ideas and the press and speech, and I just double-checked, but I can’t find any part of the Declaration that says, except when a private organization wants to write a letter to another private organization. The goal of this law clearly was to A. give the Muscadins an official enemies list to work from, and B. break the nationwide network of Jacobin Clubs.

[(16:35)](#!):

These attacks drove all the leftists back into each other’s arms, and in early November, the Jacobins applauded a speech from B. O. Verin, you know, the guy they had run out of their meeting hall on the eve of 9 Thermidor. B. O. warned them that the convention was getting ready to destroy the Jacobin Club. And in this, he was exactly right, because just down the street, a horde of Muscadins gathered at the Palais Royale. Once the very cradle of the revolution had now served as a home base for the gilded youth.

[(17:05)](#!):

When they all gathered, the gang marched down to the Jacobin Club and started chucking rocks. So many rocks that they broke every window in the place, shutting down that night’s session in a hail of projectiles. Two days later, the Muscadins went a step further. This time, they pushed their way into the Club and beat up every man and every woman that they could lay their hands on.

[(17:28)](#!):

The response to these attacks from the convention says it all. They decided that the source of these disturbances was not the Muscatine youth, but rather the Jacobin Club itself, whose very existence was now deemed an incitement to public disorder. And so it was that on November 11, 1794, the convention ordered the Jacobin Club to close. The roots of the Jacobin Club trace back to the very, very beginning of the revolution, when it first took shape in Versailles as the Breton Club, organizing the Third Estate delegates who were unwilling to play nice with the nobility.

[(18:06)](#!):

Practically every single major revolutionary leader had, at one point or another, been a member, even if most of those leaders were later expelled for being reactionary pigs. It’s where Barnov and Dupour and Lemaitre and the Fouillat come from. It’s where Brussaux and the Girondins had come from. It’s where the mountain had made its home base, and it had been neck-deep accomplices in all the Paris insurrections. It was, unquestionably, one of the most important institutions of the French Revolution. And through it all, its guiding light and beating heart\xe2\x80\x94a very small, very calculating heart but still beating\xe2\x80\x94was Maximilien Robespierre, and the Club to which he had dedicated his life, was not able to survive his death.

[(18:50)](#!):

Now this is not the end of Jacobinism, and as we will see, many of the former members of the Jacobin Club will continue to consort with each other, and will try from time to time to take a shot at returning to power. But they are now officially homeless, because the Jacobin Club is dead. So as I said last time, this week was going to be a shorter episode, so I’m going to leave it there for now, but we’ll pick it up next time with a sweep across the frontier to trace the further advance of the French armies and the steady retreat of the Allies.

[(19:25)](#!):

It had taken two years, but Jacques-Pierre Brussaux’s prophecy that old Europe could not possibly withstand the might of the fully mobilized French nation was finally coming true.

[(02:07)](#!):

So, as we discussed three episodes back, probably the biggest reason the French finally started to pull back from the Reign of Terror was the run of military successes in the first half of 1794. It was hard to convince everyone that all this emergency murder was necessary because emergency emergency when there wasn’t really any emergency. Well, the French armies just kept rolling through the second half of 1794 and that military success was the backdrop against which last week’s political swing to the right unfolded. Things were in fact going so well that by the time I’m done talking about it all today, the following things will have happened. One, the Prussians will be asking for terms of peace. Two, the Austrians will have pulled their armies back across the Rhine. Three, the French will be occupying the entirety of the Netherlands. And four, the British will have gathered up all their stuff and sailed away for home.

[(03:17)](#!):

These victories will not only shut down Flanders as the main center of the war, a distinction soon to be foisted upon Italy, but it will also greatly stabilize the French domestic economy because from here on out, every time France occupies a new territory, the people and resources of that territory will be exploited to serve the needs of France. This was 180 degrees from all the lofty rhetoric about exporting the rights of man that had been laid out back when the war started in 1792, but it also turned out to be very lucrative and made France very, very strong.

[(03:52)](#!):

So when we last left the war up in Belgium, General Jourdan had just won the Battle of Flouris in June 1794, and by won I mean was left in control of the field when the Austrians decided to withdraw from an otherwise inconclusive engagement. After Flouris, the Austrian and British components of the Allied armies split up, with the Austrians headed east towards Cologne and the British headed north up into the United Provinces. Jourdan followed the Austrians as they pulled back towards the Rhine, while General Pichagrou, he was one of those commoner generals promoted by Saint-Just and who was now commander of the Army of the North, headed up to take control of the Belgian ports along the English Channel. After Pichagrou locked down the Belgian ports, he turned his attention north.

[(04:37)](#!):

Though General Dumourier had been forced to abandon his invasion of the United Provinces back in the spring of 1793, the French still dreamed of bringing the Netherlands into the French orbit, and with the British on the run, that dream now seemed eminently attainable. At the end of August, Pichagrou got the Army of the North moving.

[(04:58)](#!):

The British were at this point still in pretty decent fighting shape, but they were getting awfully discouraged. As we’ll discuss in a minute, the Allied coalition was fracturing, and the British could not convince the Austrians to come help them block the French invasion. Stopping the French from occupying the United Provinces may have been the reason the British had gotten into the war, but what did Austria care about that? They were already abandoning their half of the Low Countries, so what did it matter what the French did with the other half? On September 5, Pichagrou ordered 10,000 men up to go occupy the town of Boxtel, and a contingent of British were sent down to block them. The ensuing little battle was not a major engagement in itself, but the British commander made a tactical blunder and retreated when he really should have advanced. This defeat at Boxtel was not so much a military setback as it was emotionally demoralizing for the British troops, and it lent an air of inevitability to French victory. Pretty soon the British were retreating still further into Dutch territory. No help was coming from the Austrians, and while the orders from home still said, keep up the fight, the officers on the ground were like, okay, but for how long? This isn’t going very well.

[(06:11)](#!):

At that same moment, General Jourdan was approaching the Austrian position along the Rhine, and he was about to meet with similar success. The Austrian army was still camped on the west side of the river, and both sides were now fielding huge armies, Jourdan commanding over 100,000 men while the Austrians had over 80,000. On September 18, the two sides met on a plateau near the town of Spremont, and though the French took heavy losses, they managed to keep pushing until the Austrians withdrew. Then a week later, on October 2, they waged a second battle across a long fortified line near the town of Aldenhoven, about 30 miles west of the Rhine. Again the French just kept pushing and drove the Austrians to retreat. Now Austria had already given up on the interior of their now clearly former province of the Austrian Netherlands, but now they gave up any pretense to holding the west bank of the Rhine. They retreated across the river, abandoning the little string of principalities on the French side of the river, including the major free city of Cologne.

[(07:15)](#!):

So the question then becomes, why were the Austrians so willing to pull back? None of these battles were really decisive, and had they wanted to, they could have dug in and fought it out. But while we’re asking that question, we might as well also ask where is Prussia in all of this? Why have they just been completely idle along their front for like a year now? The answer to both questions turns out to be the same, and as it is so often in the history of the French Revolution, the answer is Poland. Because apparently if you really want to understand the French Revolution, what you really need to do is study the history of Poland.

[(07:52)](#!):

So what the hell is going on in Poland that’s so important? Well I’ll tell you. Polish patriots have gone into revolt against Russian hegemony. Now the last time we checked in on Poland was back in episode 3.27, Advance and Retreat. That was when Catherine the Great had invaded Poland after winding up her war with the Turks. When the Russians came in, Prussia started massing troops along the Polish border. But instead of fighting, the two great powers agreed to the Second Polish Partition in January 1793 that left Poland a territorial rump of its former self and politically dominated by Russia.

[(08:30)](#!):

Polish patriots who could not stand the humiliating terms under which their government now labored spent the next year talking amongst themselves about how to reverse their fortunes. Many of these guys were senior military officers, and central among them was Tadeusz Kosciuszko.

[(08:47)](#!):

Now unfortunately, I do not have time right now to go in-depth on Kosciuszko. But I probably should have by now. After all, he had first risen to prominence after volunteering for service in the Continental Army during the American War of Independence. He quickly became the master engineer of the Continental Forces. He was the one who fortified Bemis Heights during the all-important battles at Saratoga. He was the one who built West Point. Then he transferred down to the Southern Theater where he was one of Nathaniel Greene’s key lieutenants in the campaigns against Cornwallis and Tarleton. After the American War, he returned to Poland where he had been fighting a losing battle to keep the great powers from gobbling up his homeland. If I have time, I’ll do a supplemental on him, because Kosciuszko is, in fact, awesome.

[(09:33)](#!):

But getting back to it, one of the things Russia had been up to since the Second Partition was systematically dismantling the Polish army. And over the winter of 1793-74, they made their final move, demanding that that army be reduced from 35,000 to 50,000 to just 15,000. Now this was intolerable to the Polish patriot officers because they were planning on eventually using that army to expel the Russians. With the demobilization order, they had to act now. So in March 1794, Kosciuszko announced a general insurrection from his base in Krakow. The Poles whipped a Russian force sent against them on April 4, and then they moved on to the capital of Warsaw. The Polish patriot advance was helped by a spontaneous uprising in the capital that saw the residents of Warsaw slaughter at least half the 5,000-man Russian garrison.

[(10:26)](#!):

Clearly looking to emulate the French Revolution, the Polish patriots started singing La Marseillaise in Polish, they set up Jacobin-style political clubs to support the insurrection, and then in May 1794, Kosciuszko unilaterally declared freedom for all Polish serfs, and he was attempting to duplicate the mass national mobilization that was just getting underway over in France. The unrest caused by Kosciuszko’s uprising, which is what this is all called, and the opportunities it presented were the main reason the Prussians and Austrians became so distracted from the war with France in the summer of 1794.

[(11:04)](#!):

With Catherine’s blessing, the Prussians moved into Poland, and then also with Catherine’s blessing but unbeknownst to the Prussians, the Austrians sent in a force of their own. With the military and political gravity of the Eastern Powers now revolving around Poland, Prussia went from calculated inaction against the French to actively sending out peace-feelers to Paris in October 1794, peace-feelers that would eventually result in Prussia withdrawing from the anti-French coalition in the spring of 1795.

[(11:36)](#!):

Now unfortunately for our Polish friends, the combined weight of their three territory-hungry neighbors was too much for them. In October, the army Kosciuszko led was defeated by the Russians, and Kosciuszko himself was captured. Famously, just before he was captured, Kosciuszko allegedly said, this is the end of Poland. An apocryphal or not, he was right. This is the end of Poland.

[(12:01)](#!):

On November the 4th, the Russians beat the last major Polish force outside of Warsaw, and when the Russians entered the capital, they did so with an eye on revenging the massacre of their garrison. The Russian troops were let off the leash to loot, pillage, and kill as they saw fit. It is estimated that upwards of 20,000 Poles were killed in the indiscriminate massacre that followed. In case you’re looking for a further perspective on the Reign of Terror, as many Poles died in a single day as were executed by the guillotine over the course of an entire year of the terror.

[(12:35)](#!):

With the Poles beaten militarily, it was left for the occupying powers to decide what to do next. It took a while to work out, but the decision was, let’s just divvy up the rest of Poland. The Prussians, Austrians, and Russians met for a diplomatic summit in October 1795 to haggle over their respective territorial claims, and then in January 1797, the haggling took a while, they finally signed the Third Polish Partition, which obliterated Poland from the maps of Europe for 123 years.

[(13:07)](#!):

While the Eastern powers turned their attention to Poland, the British were left to carry on a frustrated defense of the United Provinces all by their lonesome as the winter of 1794 set in. Under normal circumstances, winter would have brought an end to the campaign for the year, but the winter of 1794-1795 turned out to be one of the worst winters on record, even colder and more miserable than that epoch-making winter of 1788-1789.

What that meant was that practically every river in Northern Europe froze solid. Recognizing the opportunity, General Pishogru told his guys, hey look, winter is so bad, let’s just keep on fighting, which I’m sure that they were all thrilled to hear, but they were now able to march across frozen rivers wherever they felt like it, and so the French were able to push almost unopposed north towards Amsterdam.

[(14:02)](#!):

As they moved, the French enjoyed the rather unique privilege of being genuinely greeted as liberators. By the end of the 18th century, the Dutch Republic was in reality a dynastic oligarchy run by the House of Orange and, in practical terms, little more than a satellite of the British government. So a lot of native Dutch were genuinely excited that this French revolutionary army was going to liberate them. In Amsterdam, a citizen uprising expelled the Orange’s government, just as the French army appeared on the horizon, and the new patriot city leaders welcomed in the French with open arms.

[(14:39)](#!):

Pishogru entered Amsterdam on January 19, 1795. A few days after capturing the capital, Pishogru learned that up at the port of Danhelder, a Dutch fleet of 14 ships had been immobilized when the harbor they were anchored in froze. Pishogru ordered a detachment of his army to go take a look, and on January 23, the French cavalry launched a surprise attack across the ice and captured not only the 14 Dutch ships, but the 850 heavy guns they held between them. They say that this is the only time in military history that a fleet has been captured by a cavalry charge. And if anyone out there can dispute that claim, I would love to hear it.

[(15:24)](#!):

With the French totally ascendant in the Netherlands, the British just kept retreating until they were out of the United Provinces completely and camped in Hanoverian territory. Then they sat around waiting for the British government to recognize what the British army probably already did, and that was that continuing to try to wage a land war against the French was folly. So come the spring of 1795, Prime Minister William Pitt ordered the British army to evacuate the continent. The British were not abandoning the war with revolutionary France, but having already failed to achieve their one strategic objective on land \xe2\x80\x94 keep the United Provinces out of French hands \xe2\x80\x94 they decided to focus their attention on the sea, where the British navy was likely to have far more success than the British army had had.

[(16:13)](#!):

As it turned out, the British really had lost their one strategic objective on the continent, and the Netherlands would remain in the French orbit until the fall of Napoleon. The day the French entered Amsterdam, Patriot Dutch leaders proclaimed themselves to be the Batavian Republic \xe2\x80\x94 the Batavian bit coming from a Dutch nationalist tradition that traced its ethnic roots back to the famous Batavi, who had inhabited the region back in Roman times, and who had provided the emperors with some of their best and most reliable troops. But though the Dutch were pretty excited about being liberated, they quickly discovered that freedom and independence were not what the French had in mind for them. Far far far now from the lofty idealism of 1792, Paris was not even remotely interested in exporting the revolution in the name of freedom and liberty and national self-determination \xe2\x80\x94 it was interested in creating client states that would exist to serve the military and economic needs of France.

[(17:14)](#!):

And this run of victories in 1794 that culminated with the permanent occupation of the entire Netherlands and all those wealthy Rhine principalities? That had a lot to do with stabilizing the domestic economy of France, at the expense of all those occupied territories. So with that in mind, let’s pivot away from the war to talk about that domestic economy \xe2\x80\x94 which had been doing meh okay for most of 1794, but which was trending in a bad direction by the end of the year, when it was then clobbered by one of the worst winters of the century. One of the leading indicators of the health and stability of the economy was the value of the assigneur.

[(17:58)](#!):

After all hell had broken loose in the spring of 1793, the value of the assigneur had plunged down to 22% face value, as the convention had tried to print its way into the resources it needed to prosecute the wars on all fronts. The collapse of the assigneur was actually one of the reasons the convention had been so willing to invest power in a strong executive committee, and one of the signature accomplishments of the Committee of Public Safety had been to strengthen and stabilize the value of the paper currency.

[(18:29)](#!):

Once the committee really took over in August 1793, the value of the assigneur started to inch back up. This process was given a forced nudge when the general maximum was declared in September. The price controls and the takeover of the economic supply chain started to restrengthen the value of the assigneur. Then over the winter of 1793-1794, the committee stumbled into an inflation control measure quite by accident when they demanded a forced loan from the rich. Enacted on a sliding scale determined by your total wealth, the loan was supposed to help generate revenue, but the government accepted, and really had to accept, assigneur as a valid form of payment, and accepted it face value. So naturally, everyone paid their forced loans with virtually worthless piles of assigneur.

[(19:25)](#!):

But though the forced loan didn’t necessarily generate the real revenue that it was supposed to, the simple fact of all those assigneur being taken out of circulation raised the market value of the assigneur still floating around out there. Soon enough, the notes were once again trading at nearly 50% face value, which was pretty good. But the longer the general maximum was in effect, the harder it became to enforce, and the more heavy-handed that enforcement had to become. And by heavy-handed, I mean the terror. Outside the war zones of the Federalist cities and the Vend\xc3\xa9e, violation of the maximum was the source of most denunciations, and the source of most of the, dare I say, non-political executions.

[(20:11)](#!):

Now the Committee of Public Safety was not insensible to complaints that one standard list of prices for the whole country made no sense, and in February 1794 they issued a revised price list \xe2\x80\x94 one that took into account regional differences and factored in transportation costs. But still, for the first half of 1794, the choice for farmers and traders, merchants and wholesalers, whatever, was sell your goods and services at ruinous rates, or get your head chopped off.

[(20:41)](#!):

But when the terror was abandoned after Termidor, the whip hand keeping everyone in economic line was removed, and predictably the real market for goods was disengaged from the official market for goods. Now we would normally call this, like, the black market, but what do you call it when everything is now available only on the black market? That’s just the market.

[(21:04)](#!):

As the maximum broke down, the value of the asignac plunged back down to 20% face value by the end of 1794. Now ironically enough, just as the people of Paris were starting to suspect that the general maximum was broken and unenforceable, the National Convention was voting to extend it for another year.

[(21:24)](#!):

Now they did this simply to shore up their political left flank \xe2\x80\x94 this was about the same time they put Marat in the Pantheon \xe2\x80\x94 but then their agents and spies inside the capital reported that the people of Paris were beginning to believe that the maximum was doing more harm than good. Nothing was available at the list price, and there was no real mechanism to enforce compliance. To many convention delegates, this admission was music to their ears. For them, the general maximum had always been a terrible economic idea that was decreed only as a political expedient to stop Paris from rising up in revolt. But if the word was now that the people of Paris were themselves sick of the maximum, well by god, let’s get ourselves back on the free market. They ordered an investigation of the continued efficacy of the maximum, and that report came back a resounding, it’s not working, let’s get rid of it. So on December 24, 1794, the National Convention repealed the general maximum. Let the free market have its day.

[(22:29)](#!):

But as was the luck of all French free market enthusiasts during the revolutionary period, they abolished the maximum just as Europe was headed into one of its worst winters on record. Now the harvest of 1794 had been\xe2\x80\xa6 fine. I mean, not good by any stretch of the imagination, and the French had been forced to import grain from North America. That shipment of grain had in fact been at the center of a pretty major naval battle between the British and French in June, as the British tried to stop the convoy from reaching France. That battle was technically won by the British, but the fighting had tied them up long enough that the convoy made it through, so really, the French won that one.

[(23:09)](#!):

Now even with this shipment added to a not terrible harvest, two things conspired to make the winter of 1794-1795 just terrible for the average French consumer. First the army requisitioners had first dibs on all commodities they required. Three quarters of a million men under arms is a lot of mouths to feed, so you can just take all that right off the top. Then the winter froze all the rivers. This not only ground the internal transportation system to a halt, but it also shut down all the mills. You need running water to work the mills, and no running water means that even if you have a stockpile of grain, you can’t turn it into anything edible.

[(23:52)](#!):

So just as the maximum was being lifted, the supply of everything plummeted, and the price of everything skyrocketed. Prices were now well beyond what the poorer Parisians, for example, could afford. In January 1795, people were literally dropping dead of starvation in the streets. To compensate for this, the convention ramped up printing of awesome yaw so that people could go buy food. But this led to predictable inflation, compounded by the fact that there was not even a hint of a bluff that the currency was backed by anything.

[(24:26)](#!):

Remember, the asignon had started out as a claim on a part of the wealth and property expropriated from the church after all its lands were nationalized. Over the years, the various French national governments had tried to keep up with the number of asignon out in circulation, usually by targeting and seizing emigre property.

[(24:46)](#!):

But at this moment, in the early months of 1795, there was nothing new to stake the asignon to, and everyone knew it. As the paper flew off the presses, hyperinflation took hold. By the spring of 1795, asignon would be trading at just 8% face value. It would never recover from this crippling lack of faith in its value. The asignon was effectively dead. Now this economic crisis in Paris was of course met with unrest in the streets.

[(25:20)](#!):

But this time, there was a genuine clash of interests out there, and the staunchly Termidorian convention was willing to back anyone who would help them beat down the radical left. Thus, the Muscadine youth continued to roam the streets of Paris with impunity. They pushed their way into theaters and closed down plays they didn’t like. If the fighting dandies spotted someone wearing a red Liberty cap, they beat them up with their constitutions. They even went so far as to target and attack anyone caught singing La Marseillaise, which the Muscadines denounced as a mere Jacobin anthem. They also went round to all the de-Christianized churches and started de-de-Christianizing them. Many of the more active de-Christianizers were also acolytes of Jean-Paul Marat. And so when they went into the churches and removed the Christian icons \xe2\x80\x94 crucifixes and that sort of thing \xe2\x80\x94 they put busts of Marat up in their place. The Muscadines made a regular sport of smashing busts of Marat. This all culminated in February 1795, when, under pressure from the Muscadines, the convention voted to remove Marat from the Pantheon, where his remains had been interred for just five months. That was all the time Marat ever spent in the Pantheon.

[(26:40)](#!):

The beleaguered leftists \xe2\x80\x94 populists Saint-Culotte and ex-Jacobins \xe2\x80\x94 attempted to rally. And the kernel of another popular movement got going in January, when an obscure lawyer named Francois-Noel Babouf started anonymously publishing a paper called The Tribune of the People. The Tribune of the People helped launch the slogan we’ll deal with more deeply next week, Bread and the Constitution of 1793. But the tide had really turned against the left. Government censors swarmed on the Tribune of the People and shut it down before it could really get going, and Babouf was arrested.

[(27:19)](#!):

But for him, this was only the beginning of his radical career, and he will soon return under his more famous name, Gracchus Babouf, the Tribune of the People. The increasingly conservative bent of the revolution was seen most especially in the realm of religion, as all that de-de-Christianization attested. Now the Termidorian leaders had no intention of trying to rebuild the ancien regime Catholic Church. They had neither the time, the inclination, or the resources.

[(27:52)](#!):

But they also wanted to reverse the turn against Christianity, which had done so much to gin up domestic unrest. Now Robespierre may have mocked the cult of reason harder than anyone, but he had suggested replacing it with the megalomaniacal cult of the Supreme Being. The Termidorians wanted no part of any of that stuff. So they hit on a brilliant idea that was both utterly revolutionary in itself, and let the French go back to being Catholics if they wanted to.

[(28:22)](#!):

On September the 18th, 1794, the convention officially suspended all payments earmarked for religious institutions. This included the entire apparatus of the civic church. With one line crossed out in the budget, the Termidorian Convention cast aside the national church that had been so polarizing since the very first civic oaths had been decreed way back in 1789. But as they were zeroing out the religious budget, they also declared freedom of worship. So you can believe whatever you want, we’re just not going to pay for it anymore.

[(29:00)](#!):

This de facto separation of church and state was followed up on February the 21st, 1795 with the decree to formally separate the church from the state, something that had never even been contemplated by anyone before. Religion was just not something the Termidorian Convention wanted to argue with you about.

[(29:20)](#!):

Now the Catholic Church was not allowed as of yet to just re-inhabit their old churches \xe2\x80\x93 those were all public property. But what you did in your own home was now your own business, and Mass was celebrated in Paris on March the 8th, 1795, for the first time since October 1793.

[(29:43)](#!):

Nowhere was the impact of the decrees on religious freedom more deeply felt than in the Vend\xc3\xa9e. Third hit by the Reign of Terror and the Infernal Columns, the population of the Vend\xc3\xa9e was staggering. But much to the chagrin of the authorities in Paris, guerrilla resistance continued to plague the Republican forces trying to stamp out the last embers of a resistance. All the major cities and all the major roads were controlled by the Republicans, but loosely affiliated peasant guerrillas just refused to give it up.

[(30:16)](#!):

Then the convention was hit by very disturbing news from Brittany. Brittany was every bit as ticked off at Paris as the Vend\xc3\xa9e was, and the Bretons had been further stirred up when the Catholic and Royal Army had made their play at Granville. Soon a general popular uprising got going, and its active members were called the Schwan. But the Schwan were never as well armed nor as well led as their neighbors to the south.

[(30:44)](#!):

But still, something like 22,000 people had joined the movement by the summer of 1794, which was enough to make the Termidorian Convention want to drastically change their approach in the region. Clearly, vicious, bloody, heavy-handed tactics had failed to bring peace to the west. Maybe we should try something else?

[(31:05)](#!):

So just as religious freedom was being decreed in September, General Lazar Hoche was dispatched to the Vend\xc3\xa9e to try to negotiate his way to victory, not with the stick, but with the carrot. Upon his arrival in the region, he set about granting amnesty to rebels and releasing prisoners and saying that the Termidorian Convention was ready to talk. On December 1, the convention formally offered amnesty to all rebels who laid down their arms by January 1. Naturally, the Vend\xc3\xa9e was skeptical about anything Paris said. But the decree about religious freedom was a huge signal that this might all be real.

[(31:44)](#!):

Religion had been the key issue that had gotten the uprising going in the first place, and the convention was now saying, we don’t care about who you worship with or how you worship. That’s just not a thing for us anymore. Even later in December, the convention sent another clear signal that they were serious when Jean-Baptiste Carier was finally brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The investigation into his conduct at Nantes had come back with a resounding, let’s put the bastard on trial. And so at the end of November, they did.

[(32:19)](#!):

At his trial, Carier was defiant. He denied having taken any part in these contemptible deeds, and then said he was only following orders, and that if he was guilty, then the whole convention was guilty \xe2\x80\x94 quote \xe2\x80\x94 right down to the president’s bell, unquote. The Revolutionary Tribunal did not agree. They convicted Carier and sentenced him to death. On December 16, he became one of those last few victims of the guillotine. When word got back to the Vend\xc3\xa9e that the Butcher of Nantes had just gotten his head chopped off, well, maybe the convention really was serious about coming to terms.

[(32:58)](#!):

And indeed they were. In January, full-on negotiations were underway between General Hoche and the remaining leaders of the insurrection. Hoche’s pitch turned out to be extremely generous, and basically conceded every point that had driven the Vend\xc3\xa9e into rebellion in the first place.

[(33:17)](#!):

Freedom of worship was already confirmed, but he also offered exemption from the draft, which had been the flashpoint that had gotten everything going. He also offered compensation for any destroyed or seized property. His basic position was, look, if you lay down your arms, we’ll give you everything you want. The only demand that he could not grant was returning the king to the throne. But other than that, let’s just end this thing, okay? And this was very nearly the beginning of the end of the war in the Vend\xc3\xa9e. But unfortunately for everyone involved, we’re not there quite yet.

[(33:55)](#!):

As we will see next week, the more intransigent rebel leaders were delighted to be drawing out negotiations, because it lulled the Republicans into a false sense of security. As the Republicans were so lulled, the rebels negotiated with British contacts and French \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 leaders based in London to land a royalist army in the West to bring the entire region back into full revolt, with the aim of getting that final unmeetable demand, placing the young \xe2\x80\x94 and still incarcerated \xe2\x80\x94 Louis XVII on the throne.

[(34:31)](#!):

But as we will see next week, all those hopes will be dashed by the disastrous Quibron Bay expedition in June. But before we get into that comedy of errors, though, we will need to head back to Paris to follow the inevitable confrontation between the left and the right in Paris. A confrontation that will turn into a decisive defeat of the left, but also convince the convention that if the political situation was ever going to be stabilized, that France needed a new, new constitution.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Code 3.41 Bread and the Constitution of 1793.

[(02:03)](#!):

As the spring of 1795 approached, the French Revolution headed towards yet another major crisis. The winter had been unimaginably brutal. Food and fuel were both in fatally short supply, the domestic economy was about to collapse, and in Paris, the people were frozen and starving and getting mighty restless. The increasingly conservative Thermidorian Convention had given the Muscadine youth a free hand to keep the Sonque Lot from effectively organizing themselves, but by March 1795, things had gotten so bad in the poor eastern sections of Paris that they were starting to push back strongly against Thermidorian repression.

[(02:42)](#!):

This would all explode in April and May 1795 with a series of insurrections that will either mark the beginning of a new populist era or be the last hurrah of the Sonque Lot as a major political force. Spoiler alert, it’s going to be the latter.

[(02:60)](#!):

The problem for what remained of the left, the Sonque Lot and their ex-Jacoban allies, was that they now lacked both organizational infrastructure to get their forces moving in the same direction and top-notch leaders to, well, lead those forces. The systematic dismantling of the sectional assemblies, the suppression of the popular societies, the subjugation of the Paris Commune’s General Assembly meant that there just wasn’t any place for the leftists to organize and coordinate and scheme.

[(03:30)](#!):

And even if they did manage to hunker down and plot without getting their heads bashed in by the Muscadine, the leaders of the left were a pale shadow of the old giants. There was no Danton among them, nor any charismatic enrag\xc3\xa9s like Jacques Roux or Jean Varlet. The presses were not pumping out the stirring propaganda of a Marat or a Hebert or even a Demoulin. The cream of the populist leadership had all been killed. All that was left were second-tier agitators.

[(03:58)](#!):

Passionate? Yes? Angry? You betcha. But none of them were equal to the task at hand. The only thing they really had going for them was that the poor Parisians were starving to death and freezing to death. And desperation is a powerful motivator.

[(04:15)](#!):

On the other side of this political divide was the Termidorian Convention, which was in the process of turning itself into an even more conservative body. Previous Paris insurrections had always been aided and abetted from the inside by delegates of the national government. For example, inside the legislative assembly when the insurrection of August 10 was launched, and then the national convention during, say, the purge of the Girondins. As we’ll see over the course of today’s episode, there was a concerted effort to deny the streets their inside men. First, the convention started to push out the terrorist wing of the Termidorian reaction \xe2\x80\x93 that is, the guys who would help overthrow Robespierre because they were too extreme for the incorruptibles’ virtuous tastes. But then second, the convention started to rehabilitate and readmit to its ranks delegates who had been purged at various points over 1793 and 1794 for being too moderate.

[(05:10)](#!):

This process got started in September 1794 when the convention made two moves. First, they invited the 75 to retake their seats. Who were the 75? Well, I mentioned them briefly in episode 3.29. They were the delegates of the convention who had signed a petition protesting the purge of the Girondins, not because they themselves were Girondin, but because they were offended in principle that the streets of Paris had just coerced the convention into arresting their own members. For this, they too had been purged from the convention, though they were simply barred from taking their seats rather than being actually arrested.

[(05:49)](#!):

And not to get off on a tangent, but lending further credence to the idea that Robespierre didn’t really start to go bonkers until sometime in early 1794. When the core Girondins had been slated for execution in October 1793, more hardcore extremists wanted to round up and send the 75 to the guillotine along with them. But Robespierre had personally stepped in to save all their lives. I mean, he really was pretty reasonable right up until about February 1794.

[(06:20)](#!):

Anyway, this recall of the 75 was then matched on the other side of the ledger by an order to investigate the conduct of the Four. Who were the Four? Well, the Four were the most ardently pro-terror members of the old committees. In no particular order, that meant, first, the Butcher of Lyon, Jean-Marie Calot de Bois. Second, his Saint-Qulot colleague, Jacques-Nicolas Biau-Varin. Third, another leading member of the Committee of Public Safety, Bertrand Barraire. And if any of you out there are big fans of Barraire, I’ve totally neglected him, even though he’s been right in the thick of things since the trial of the king, usually trying to act as a stabilizing moderator between all the various little factions. I’m sorry for neglecting him. He just hasn’t really been that central enough. Then fourth was Marc-Guillaume-Alexy Vadier, who had been one of the main leaders of the Committee of General Security, allied with Hebert and the Ultras. Vadier had helped orchestrate the trial and execution of Danton and the old Courtelier gang, and then been the one running the investigation of that religious nut, Katerine Teo, in an attempt to embarrass Robespierre.

[(07:33)](#!):

Each of the four had played a central role in the Termidorian conspiracy to overthrow Robespierre, but they were also all hardcore left-wing terrorists, so it was time for them to go. Over the first few months of 1795, the fate of the four hung in the air as the investigation into their conduct ran its course. Vadier did not wait around for a verdict, and he just went into hiding. But the other three remained defiantly visible. But they might have regretted that visible defiance on March the 2nd, when the Commission came back and recommended they all be arrested and formal legal proceedings be opened against them. So off to jail went the four\xe2\x80\x94well, really the three, since Vadier had gone to ground. The convention followed up this little purge of its left-wing terrorists by readmitting even more delegates who had been purged, outlawed, or exiled over the years. Specifically now we’re talking about the guys who had participated in\xe2\x80\x94or at least been accused of participating in\xe2\x80\x94the Federalist Revolt of 1793. The political narrative was now being rewritten, and the Federalist delegates were being cast as principled defenders of the Constitution who had stood against the radical despots who had seized control of Paris with the help of the bloodthirsty Saint-Culot rabble.

[(08:57)](#!):

Now speaking of those Saint-Culot rabble, the purge of their friends\xe2\x80\x94and rehabilitation of their enemies\xe2\x80\x94was not missed by them at all. Added to the dire economic straits they were enduring, the poor eastern sections of Paris started getting pretty riled up. They might not be organized, and they might not have leaders, but they were getting pretty mad.

[(09:20)](#!):

Now the one thing that had really been keeping them from blowing their tops was a free bread ration that had been set up back during the height of the dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety. But by March 1795, the available supply of flour was dwindling down to nothing, and the ration was cut and cut again. Then the fickle mob also started questioning whether or not they had been tricked into turning their backs on the terror and the general maximum. None of them had advanced degrees in macroeconomics to really understand what was happening around them, so they were left to draw conclusions from simple equations like, when the terror and the maximum were in effect, we had food to eat. Now that they have been abolished, we are starving.

[(10:04)](#!):

On March 17th, the women of Paris were by now super fed up by the lack of food, and attempted a disorganized march on the convention to petition the national government to do something to alleviate their suffering. But these women were met out in front of the convention hall by a phalanx of Muscadine. The Muscadine leader, Freirone, had organized the fight in dandies to the point where they could now act as a sort of standing guard for the convention against uninvited guests. So the Muscadine greeted these uninvited women with insults and jeers and threats of violence.

[(10:39)](#!):

But the women were ultimately allowed to present their petition, though of course nothing really came of it. I mean, sure, the convention passed a decree ordering an increased commitment to the delivery of food to the capital, but there was little they could actually do to solve the problem. There just wasn’t enough flour. Because guess what happened when France started to thaw out from its horrible winter? That’s right, all those once frozen rivers flooded, so all the mills were still inoperable.

[(11:07)](#!):

So then the convention passed a more practical response to the women’s petition by passing a law on March the 21st making it illegal to march on the convention with the intention of issuing seditious threats. So hopefully that’ll take care of any more of that. But boy, it sure did not. With the food and fuel situation not improving, and in fact getting worse, the eastern section of Paris were convulsed by bread riots over March the 27th and March the 28th. The few remaining radical leaders tried to direct this energy towards a march on the convention, but they just couldn’t get it going.

[(11:44)](#!):

A few more days of organizing, though, and they actually started to get a bit of momentum. The rallying cry that everyone seemed ready to embrace was bread and the constitution of 1793. Now the bread part is obviously the main driver here, but there was still a lingering memory of the popular constitution of 1793 as the promise of some kind of democratic utopia for France, and if nothing else, implementing the constitution of 1793 meant electing a new legislature, which meant tossing out the increasingly reactionary bums running the Termidorian Convention. So everybody’s cool with uniting behind bread and the constitution of 1793? Cool? Alright. Let’s go have a march.

[(12:29)](#!):

On April the 1st, 1795, 12 Germanon year 3 on the Republican calendar, about 10,000 Parisians surged out of the eastern sections. This mob easily overwhelmed the musket in outside the convention, and in no time they had pushed their way into the hall and disrupted the session with chants of bread and the constitution of 1793. But unfortunately, they did not have a charismatic spokesman. They had not coordinated with potential collaborators inside the convention, and frankly, they didn’t really have any concrete demands to make. So this energetic show of force soon dissipated into an aimless milling about. After about four hours, the whole exercise had clearly run out of steam. Reports came in that outside National Guard companies drawn from the western sections were mustering, backed up by reinforced musket in youth. Then a few of the old mountain delegates who could easily see where this was all headed came down and convinced the mob to go home peacefully.

[(13:33)](#!):

Once the rabble had been cleared out, the convention wasted no time before striking back. On April the 2nd, they abruptly wound up the trial of the four by declaring them all guilty and ordering their immediate deportation to France Guiana. But in the end, only Collo de Bois and Biot-Varenne would actually be exiled. Vadier was still in hiding, and while Barrere was transferred to a prison on the Atlantic coast, he managed to escape with the help of a friend and went into hiding, not publicly surfacing again until after the rise of Napoleon.

[(14:07)](#!):

Although deportation to Guiana was commonly referred to as the Dry Guillotine because it was considered a death sentence, Biot-Varenne managed to live through the ordeal, eventually emigrating to New York in 1816 before finally settling in Haiti, where he died in 1819. His friend and colleague Collo de Bois, however, was not so fortunate. The butcher of Lyon died of yellow fever in 1796.

[(14:35)](#!):

After dispensing with the four, the convention then turned its attention to the inflammatory constitution of 1793, which was now clearly a left-wing rallying point. It was true that it was getting a mite embarrassing that France was not yet operating under constitutional government. I mean, the national convention had been convened in September 1792 to do one thing \xe2\x80\x93 write a constitution for France. And here they all were, more than two and a half years later, still just kind of winging it. The non-implementation of the constitution was also hard to justify, since the reason it had been set aside was emergency, emergency. But now one of the underlying rationales of the Thermidorian Convention was that the emergency was over. So okay, maybe we should ditch revolutionary government and try to establish constitutional government, as was our original core mandate.

[(15:32)](#!):

But all that said, no one now thought it was a good idea to just implement the constitution of 1793 as it stood, written as it was by a bunch of prescribed and executed terrorists. So let’s maybe form a committee to pick through it and recommend some amendments. But that committee quickly came to the conclusion that amendments and revisions were not going to be enough. So on April the 18th, a committee of eleven was formed to compose a new, new constitution for France. We’ll talk about that new, new constitution next week.

[(16:08)](#!):

To further ensure that the convention was not bothered by mobs who might oppose the abandonment of the constitution of 1793, they also went ahead and decreed a little martial law in the capital. Fresh off his victories in the Netherlands, General Pichagrou just so happened to be in Paris while all of this was going on, and the convention said, General, would you please help us restore order? And Pichagrou said, why yes, I’d love to. And it is true that he went about this job with relish. As we will see in the episodes to come, despite the fact that Pichagrou was the son of a peasant who had only risen as high as he had thanks to the revolution in general, and Saint-Just in particular, who promoted him, Pichagrou had a strong conservative bent. He was, in point of fact, a closeted royalist who was far less committed to the revolution than you might think for a guy who has just accepted the honorific title, Savior of the Fatherland. But we’ll get to all that down the road. For today, we need only focus on the fact that Pichagrou was only too happy to go lay down the law on the rabble.

[(17:15)](#!):

On April the 10th, the convention passed the police law, which served as the legal framework for Pichagrou’s crackdown. It basically said that anyone who could be implicated in any part of the reign of terror could be disarmed, detained, or harassed at will. Pichagrou then organized squads of National Guard, regular army units, and unofficially, the Muscatine, to go raid through the eastern sections, inducing its residents to identify who amongst them had been prominent in the days of the terror. And somewhere around 1600 men and women were so identified and arrested.

[(17:53)](#!):

The result of the raids was to further neutralize the sans-culottes as an organized, or even organizable force. But Pichagrou’s martial law would not break them completely. It would take one more cycle of insurrection and retaliation to really finish the job.

[(18:12)](#!):

But the crackdown in Paris turned out to be a minor blip on the historical radar, compared to what the police law of April the 10th triggered out in the departments. Informed that the terrorist leaders in all the various municipalities were now fair game, their disgruntled former victims could get going with what we call the White Terror, when the persecute head became the persecutors.

[(18:36)](#!):

Now it is called the White Terror because white is the color of the House of Bourbon, and the general sense was that this was an expression of pent-up royalism finally revenging itself upon the revolution. But though royalism was a defining feature of the White Terror in a few instances, for the most part what we’re really talking about is all those men and women who had been harassed, jailed, had their property confiscated, seen their friends and their relatives executed, not because they were counter-revolutionary royalists, but simply because they were insufficiently extreme in their devotion to the revolution. So this was not about trying to restore the monarchy. This was about revenge.

[(19:20)](#!):

The first incident of the White Terror actually occurred back in February 1795, when a group of former terrorist officials in Nimes who had been arrested were just butchered by their guards. But the law of April the 10th is really what got things going on a mass scale. The Termidorian representatives on mission were now in charge of nominating men to fill the local municipal governments, and so it was a staunchly anti-terrorist cohort that came to power just as the law of April the 10th was being disseminated.

[(19:53)](#!):

With the legal cover they needed, these new municipal authorities went out hunting for damned bloodthirsty Jacobins who had caused so much pain and so much suffering.

[(20:03)](#!):

Once the terrorists had been locked up in the local jails, well, that’s when the revenge started to kick in. On May the 4th, an attack on a prison in Lyon resulted in somewhere between 100 and 200 ex-terrorists getting butchered. Then about a week later, a similar prisoner slaughter in the city of Aix killed about 60 prisoners. On May the 24th, 24 prisoners were killed in Tarascon, and then on June the 5th, another hundred-plus were killed in Marseille, and this last attack was personally orchestrated by the representative on mission.

[(20:38)](#!):

But the prison massacres were really just one part of the White Terror, the more consolidated, official White Terror. Unofficially, armed bands went roaming around picking off targets one by one, exacting a sort of vigilante justice on the hated terrorists, eschewing official legal channels, lynch mobs and armed gangs of various sizes criss-crossed the countryside. These bands started to sprout up all across France, but they were mostly concentrated in the Southeast, particularly in the Rhone Valley, where the terror had been particularly brutal. Targeted former terrorists were ambushed on lonely roads between here and there, and just summarily executed. Then a mob might come together spontaneously, descend on a house, and just lynch all the inhabitants inside.

[(21:26)](#!):

Over the summer of 1795, about a hundred thousand people would be locked up, and about two thousand killed. So, the White Terror was not on the scale of The Terror, but it was still pretty brutal.

[(21:40)](#!):

Now, of course, it’s all pretty easy to understand, and even justify, these revenge murders. I mean, think about the guys who were now being killed. A year ago, they were staffing the watch committees and the revolutionary tribunals that had locked up close to 500,000 people across France on incredibly vague charges, and then killed as many as they felt like. These are not nice people we’re talking about here. But still, it’s important to keep in mind that for a lot of people, the principled objection to the Reign of Terror turned out to be a principled objection to being on the wrong side of the Reign of Terror.

[(22:19)](#!):

Now just as the National Convention was getting going with all these retaliatory crackdowns, their own political legitimacy was given a huge boost. The fortunes of war are always a crucial factor in the survival of a domestic government, and in the spring of 1795, the fortunes of war had turned unambiguously in France’s favor. In fact, the spring of 1795 proved to be a pretty decisive turning point in the war as the pan-European anti-French coalition finally disintegrated.

[(22:53)](#!):

As we discussed last week, the Prussians have had one foot out the door for a long time now, and after requesting peace talks through back channels back in October, France and Prussia each dispatched negotiators to work out a deal. On April the 5th, 1795, both sides signed the Treaty of Basel, and Prussia officially pulled out of the war. The formal clauses of the treaty are not nearly as interesting as the main secret clause of the treaty, that Prussia would not challenge French sovereignty on the west bank of the Rhine if France pulled back from the territories it had occupied on the right bank of the Rhine, and the French were currently occupying some land on the far side of the river.

[(23:37)](#!):

With the deal struck and the Rhine now acting as a strong and rational border for France, the Prussians would spend the next decade not getting involved in any further wars against the French. It would not be until 1806 that they would finally join up again in what was by then the fourth anti-French coalition because, you know, Napoleon.

[(23:59)](#!):

The withdrawal of Prussia was a huge blow to the Allied cause, and basically guaranteed that the British would not be getting back the Netherlands any time soon, which the Prussians had just said in that secret clause is French territory and we’re cool with that. Cementing their hegemony over the Netherlands, France and the new Batavian Republic signed the Treaty of the Hague on May 16th, 1795. The Dutch pledged their navy in support of the French cause, agreed not to make any claims on the Dutch-speaking citizens of what used to be the Austrian Netherlands, but which was about to be annexed into France. They also agreed, in another secret clause, to allow the French to maintain a 25,000-man occupying garrison.

[(24:44)](#!):

Did I ever talk about how the early revolutionaries hated these kinds of secret clauses and denounced them as the tools of despotic princes used to sell out their own people? I didn’t? Well, no matter, no one clearly cares about that stuff anymore.

[(24:58)](#!):

And just to round this out, the French also then signed a treaty with the Spanish in mid-July. Now the Spanish front had never been a critical front of the war, but it had required the French to deploy men and resources to cover the Pyrenees. Now for Spain’s part, the treaty was completely understandable. Their armies were proving no match for the French, so they got out of the war while the getting was good. So back in the spring of 1793, France was surrounded by enemies on all sides and stretched almost fatally thin. But by the summer of 1795, those enemies were dropping out of the war one by one and France was able to concentrate all of her now considerable military resources on just the Austrians and the British. The tide had certainly turned.

[(25:49)](#!):

Now had the war not been going so well? It is likely that the convention would have been far more vulnerable to a popular insurrection. But luckily for them, they didn’t have to worry about historical counterfactuals and so when the insurrection of one prairial came along, they were in a great position to smack it down and hard.

[(26:10)](#!):

The insurrection of one prairial, year three, that is May the 20th, 1795, was a sequel to the failed insurrection of 12 germanels. The martial law crackdowns had hit the eastern sections hard, but the economic situation in the capital remained dire. Though the winter weather had turned and no one was freezing to death anymore, food supplies in Paris continued to be tragically limited. So after General Pichacroux returned to the front, some of the sections began to defiantly hold public assemblies again and the talk at those assemblies was mostly about doing a better job the next time they rose up against those bastards running the convention.

[(26:51)](#!):

Bread and the constitution of 1793 would once again serve as the primary rallying cry, but this time they planned to be better armed, bring more men to the party, and have concrete demands that they would force the convention to pass. Once all the planning was done, an anonymous circular made the rounds on May the 19th called the people’s insurrection to obtain bread and recover our rights. It called on the people of Paris to assemble the next day to, well, obtain bread and recover their rights.

[(27:24)](#!):

The next morning, May the 20th, 1795, the toxin bells began to ring just like in the old days and mobs started gathering. Now there is a lot of evidence though that most of the men were not necessarily super stoked to be going out as shock troops for yet another insurrection, and that it was actually the women who went around to all the workshops yelling at the men to drop their tools and get out there and save their families.

[(27:50)](#!):

So once everyone had gathered in strength, they marched together on the convention, reaching the hall at about two in the afternoon. An initial wave of insurrectionaries pushed their way into the convention, but they were beaten back by armed guards. The mob was then stiffly reinforced by companies of national guard drawn from the eastern sections. These trained and armed national guardsmen helped the mob push its way back into the convention. And then things got a little ugly. A Termidorian deputy tried to stand in their way, but for his trouble, he was shot dead where he stood. The mob then cut off the guy’s head and mounted it on a pike. So when they finally all came bursting into the hall, a severed head was the first thing the delegates inside saw.

[(28:39)](#!):

Now once inside, the mob leaders identified the last remaining mountain delegates and demanded that they introduce the list of insurrectionary demands. And what were those demands? A plan to deliver food to the starving capital, a plan to activate the constitution of 1793 and hold the requisite elections for a new legislature. Then the release of all those imprisoned in the recent crackdowns and the return of an independent Paris Commune General Assembly.

[(29:08)](#!):

Either from fear or because they were genuinely swept up in the moment, a few of the mountain delegates stepped forward to introduce these measures, to their own undoing as it would ultimately turn out. With the convention occupied by the insurrectionary Saint-Culotte, a counterforce started gathering outside the hall, one that was loyal to, or at least controlled by, the convention. Finally around midnight, this force started to push their way into the hall to evict the insurrectionaries. Amazingly, no shots appeared to have been fired as the mob was successfully pushed out. But this was not going to be the end of it.

[(29:50)](#!):

Overnight and then towards dawn, the insurrectionaries regrouped for a second attempt, and this time their allied national guard units rolled out the artillery. By mid-afternoon on May 21st, 20,000 angry men and women surrounded the convention with artillery in place. But they were not the only force out there under arms that day. A mix of national guard drawn from the western sections, and musket and street fighters, and regular army soldiers added up to nearly 40,000 men, double what the insurrectionaries had mustered.

[(30:26)](#!):

The combined 60,000 people now staring each other down outside the convention was the single largest mass confrontation in Paris during the whole course of the French Revolution. But while the ensuing standoff was tense, neither side appears to have wanted to make the first move. As had been the case going back to the beginning of the revolution, all those regular army troops were really just sans-culottes in uniform, and they were every bit as hungry as the starving wretches currently on the other side of the lines. So they weren’t eager to start firing, and indeed a company of gunners actually defected over to the insurrectionaries.

[(31:06)](#!):

But as for those insurrectionaries, they were shifting their feet nervously as they sized up the defenders of the convention who outnumbered them two to one and were way better armed. It had to have been clear to most of them that they were not going to win if it came down to actual fighting, and continued dedication to the insurrection was liable to get them all killed.

[(31:30)](#!):

So both sides breathed a huge sigh of relief when some convention delegates came out and said, hey, if you have a petition, we’ll be happy to hear it. So a group of petitioners were allowed in to say their piece and make their demands, which they did, bred and the constitution of 1793, thank you. When the petitioners emerged, the explosive situation was defused. The insurrectionary mob dispersed, and the defenders of the convention stood down. Amazingly, the whole thing had come off with almost no bloodshed to speak of, aside from that guy who had gotten his head jammed on top of a pike.

[(32:09)](#!):

But of course, the convention was not just going to let this latest insurrection disappear quietly back into the eastern sections from whence it had come, where it could simply lie dormant. The very next day, they launched a punitive attack on everyone. The convention ordered its forces to surround the rebellious sections, and were then met with hastily erected barricades. The regular troops and national guard units waited for instructions, but the musketon pushed their way past the barricades and tried to beat the rabble into submission. But not being backed up by the official troops, they had to retreat back across the barricades.

[(32:47)](#!):

But with an overwhelming force now surrounding them, the beleaguered insurrectionary sections raised the white flag and surrendered. The men who had killed the deputy in the convention hall were named and handed over, as were the gunners who defected. Then the convention troops marched through the streets in force. Upwards of 3,000 men and women were arrested, and every potential weapon was confiscated, and the less well-off were immediately banned from national guard service, turning it back into the active citizen militia that it had started out as.

[(33:24)](#!):

The convention then set up a special tribunal to try the leaders of the insurrection, and ultimately found 36 guilty and sentenced them to death. Among those convicted were the mountain deputies who had introduced the demands when the mob had taken over the convention, and who were now quite erroneously being blamed for organizing the whole thing. Six of these delegates were sentenced to death on June 17, including Gibert Romb, who you may remember as the head science nerd in charge of the committee that created the Republican calendar.

[(33:58)](#!):

In an obviously planned bit of tragic theater, four of these condemned delegates, including Romb, pulled out knives and killed themselves as they were being led from the courtroom, and they would live on in the popular imagination as the martyrs of Prairial. The insurrections of Germinal and Prairial marked the end of the line for the sans-culottes, the men and women who had once been so central to the course of the revolution, really dictating its course for years, were now truly beaten into submission. Now this wouldn’t be the end of left-wing populism per se, but the sans-culottes version of the French Revolution is done.

[(34:43)](#!):

Next week we will move into a new version of the French Revolution. With the constitution of 1793 now totally discredited, the convention would draft the constitution of year three, which will create the Directory, that repressive, corrupt, but occasionally useful government that would run France until Napoleon decided that he could do a way better job.

[(02:07)](#!):

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.42 \xe2\x80\x93 The Whiff of Grapeshot Last time, the Termidorian Convention beat the pulp out of the left wing of the French Revolution. Attempted insurrections of twelve germanons and one prairial effectively ended the Saint-Qulot as an independent political force. Out in the departments, the White Terror was suppressing all the old Jacobin municipal leaders. So in the summer of 1795, the political left had pretty much hit rock bottom.

[(02:52)](#!):

A perfectly natural consequence of this bottoming out was that the long-nascent political right was starting to believe that their time had finally come. And we’re not talking about moderate revolutionaries here. We’re talking about real honest-to-god monarchists. Those guys took one look at the space that was being opened up by the suppression of the left and said, well boys, it looks like this might be our chance to finally step out of the shadows. But the Termidorians had zero interest in letting these royalists come out of the shadows, so just as last week’s episode was about beating the crap out of the left, today’s episode will be about beating the crap out of the right.

[(03:32)](#!):

There’s no better place to start this beatdown than out west, with the disastrous Quibron Bay Expedition. Now we left the west two episodes back, with Lazar Hoche coming into the region to try to mix a few carrots in with the stick to bring the insurrection to a final conclusion. And from the time he arrived in August 1794 through the spring of 1795, Hoche was pretty uniformly successful. After all, he did come bearing a lot of carrots, freedom of worship and exemption from the draft being the two biggest.

[(04:06)](#!):

With their two biggest complaints resolved, enthusiasm for the insurrection waned amongst the people of the west. Hoche then signed a treaty with one of the main rebel leaders in the Vendee in February 1795, and then another treaty in April with a few of the main Shu’an leaders, that is, the new rebels who were rising up in Brittany.

[(04:26)](#!):

But just as Hoche seemed to be putting the finishing touches on the peace, a couple of things happened. First, the convention turned its guns on the left, and the white terror got going out in the departments. This, as I said, gave heart to conservative royalists like the western rebels. Second, the final defeat of the British up in the Netherlands led the Ministry of Prime Minister William Pitt to consider other ways to strategically deploy British resources to continue fighting the French. The rebels in the west and the British had been in contact for a while, but with the British focusing mostly on trying to win the war in the north, and the rebels always a bit disorganized, the two had never truly joined forces. The failed march on Granville was the closest they had managed to come on that front. But over 1794 and 1795, one of the main Shu’an leaders, a guy named Joseph de Poussey, had been steadily working his contacts in London, painting for them a picture of a vast popular uprising underway that needed only guns and supplies to break the entire region away from Parisian control. As we are about to see, though, Poussey was perhaps overstating things just a bit.

[(05:41)](#!):

But with their spies in Paris telling them that the right was indeed ascendant, the British decided to throw their lot in with Poussey. They started massing supplies to arm and equip 70,000 men in the Channel Islands. Poussey, meanwhile, traveled around southern England drumming up support from amongst the various French \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 communities. A lot of those \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s were old sword nobles, army officers who had been itching to do something, anything for years now, and Poussey signed up 3,000 of them to serve. This was pretty good, except that Poussey had been shooting for 15,000. Oh well, no matter. When the expedition lands, we are sure to be joined by a population eager to be led back into the fight to liberate France from the revolution once and for all and put 10-year-old Louis the 17th, still a prisoner in Paris, on the throne.

[(06:36)](#!):

But just as the expedition was taking its final form, things took a minor twist. When word emerged from Paris that 10-year-old Louis the 17th was dead.

[(06:48)](#!):

The nature of the boy’s captivity and his ultimate fate are still a matter of historical debate. The main problem being that after the restoration, almost all the records of his time in captivity were destroyed. But the basic story became that after being taken away from his mother back in 1793, the boy was handed off to an illiterate cobbler. And then when that cobbler went away, the boy was locked up in solitary confinement, beaten according to the sadistic whims of his guards, and then finally died of tuberculosis after basically being neglected to death.

[(07:24)](#!):

Now, there is reason to believe that a lot of this story is exaggerated for effect. But it seems like the basics are true, and that the boy, whose health had always been fragile, was badly mistreated until he finally just died.

[(07:39)](#!):

Living now in Genoa, the \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 comps de Provence, eldest of Louis the 16th’s remaining brothers, immediately declared himself King Louis the 18th. He also issued a set of declared aims, which was basically, we’re going to roll everything back to May 1789. Now, no one in Europe recognized the claim of the alleged Louis the 18th, which does give you some idea about just how little the other European powers cared about restoring the old Bourbon Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime.

[(08:13)](#!):

Okay, so getting back to the failed expedition. Though the British didn’t really care about restoring the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime, they did want to cripple the current government of France. So at the end of June 1795, they launched the ill-fated Kebron Bay expedition. That’s the other adjective you see for it a lot, ill-fated, ill-fated and disastrous. That pretty much sums it up.

[(08:38)](#!):

The landing site for the expedition was obviously Kebron Bay, on the southern side of Brittany, and more specifically, the narrow Kebron Peninsula that juts south from the mainland. Now, it was a bit troubling to the British that the so-called mass uprising couldn’t capture a proper port, but Pusey assured his handlers that that was only because they didn’t have the equipment. Once we land the guns, everything will be cool, I swear.

[(09:05)](#!):

And for like two seconds, it seemed like he might be right. When the emigre force landed on June 27th, somewhere on the order of 10,000 Shuon did indeed rally to their cause. The small local republican garrison was overwhelmed, and a beachhead was established at the base of the peninsula. But they were never going to make it off that beachhead.

[(09:28)](#!):

The combined force showed no cohesion, no chain of command, and no clear idea of what it was going to do next. The corps of the emigre expeditionaries even refused to take orders directly from Pusey, who they considered an impure royalist because he had stayed in France instead of emigrating. So they elected instead to take orders from one of their own senior emigre officers.

[(09:52)](#!):

Meanwhile, the Shuon were truly disorganized peasants who weren’t really taking orders from anyone. And so, as they all sat around on the peninsula trying to get it together, Lazar Hoche was told of the landing. He gathered up a well-disciplined republican force of about 13,000 men, and marched straight away to Quiberone Bay to put a stop to the invasion.

[(10:14)](#!):

Hoche and his army arrived on July the 3rd, and found the royalists still just kind of hanging out. Not taking any chances, Hoche advanced slowly and methodically. He took the base of the peninsula over July the 7th and 8th, and then over the course of the next two weeks, the two sides battled back and forth, but the republicans continued to push down the peninsula. Hoche launched a final decisive attack on July the 20th. About 2,500 royalist forces managed to escape by rowboat back to the British ships, including Pusey, but the rest were beaten and trapped.

[(10:51)](#!):

That night, the two sides worked out terms of surrender, with Hoche apparently promising to spare all their lives, which if he did make that promise, he had no intention of keeping it. After taking close to 6,500 prisoners, Hoche set up a military tribunal to identify emigres under arms and have them shot. This, according to a law passed in the early days of the war in 1792. The republic had no patience for nobles under arms fighting against the fatherland. Of the thousand or so emigres captured, 640 were summarily shot. Along with over 100 Shu’an charged with various brands of treason, Hoche executed about 750 men in the days after the pacification of Kibron.

[(11:40)](#!):

So the now failed Kibron Bay expedition was supposed to be the start of a general uprising in the west, and further south in the Mande, the rebel leader who had just come to terms with Hoche back in February broke the treaty and returned to arms. He had only made the deal with the republicans because at that point he was isolated, and the momentum was running away from his cause. So he was perfectly happy to be getting back to work in July, except then the news came down that Kibron Bay was ill-fated and disastrous, and he was back to being isolated and fighting all on his own again. He concentrated his forces along the coast to hopefully secure lines to the British, but the momentum was already fast running away from his cause again. At that same moment, the French were signing the treaty with Spain that we talked about last week, which freed up loads of guys who had been stationed along the Pyrenees to march north into the Mande, just as Hoche was starting to march south. So the remaining Mande rebels were trapped against the coast, and that is where we are going to leave them for this week.

[(12:50)](#!):

Now though the renewed fighting in the west was fairly easily contained, it did put the Termidorian Convention on notice. Coupled with the continuation of the white terror and cheered on by a right-wing press that was getting more strident and self-confident, it was clear that the greatest threat to the convention now lay to the right, not the left. So as the committee of eleven worked up the draft for the new constitution, they had in the back of their minds that the most important thing right now was to ensure stability and make sure that when the transition to the new government happened, that it would not be captured by a bunch of conservatives who would undo the whole revolutionary project.

[(13:32)](#!):

Because though the Termidorians aren’t ideologues in any way, they did have things they valued. And remember, anyone who had been elected into the convention back in 1792 pretty much had to be a committed Republican. None of them wanted the monarchy to return. Beyond that though, what they’re really doing here is making the first stab at separating the bad revolution of August the 10th 1792 which led to massacres and the reign of terror from the good revolution of July 1789 which had led to the declaration of the rights of man and enlightened social and economic reforms.

[(14:11)](#!):

Now whether you can actually do this is one of the longest running debates in the historiography of the French Revolution. That is, whether the reign of terror was an integral and inevitable continuation of the events of 1789 or whether it was a bloody detour that can be safely quarantined. The Termidorians are clearly the first to take a crack at separating the two and say look everything was going great and then some crazy buggers got ahold of the thing and ruined it for everybody. But now we are going to set things right.

[(14:45)](#!):

So the Constitution of Year Three is in many ways an attempt to get back to the good revolution of 1789. And with the lessons of the failure of the Constitution of 1791 in hand, the Committee of Eleven hoped to forge a constitution that would prevent the revolution from going off the rails again.

[(15:04)](#!):

This constitution was prefaced as usual by a declaration of rights in 22 specific bullet points. But of course these would not be the same set of rights that had preceded the ultra-democratic Constitution of 1793. Gone was the statement that the aim of society was the common happiness. Gone were the rights to public assistance and education and for sure the right to insurrection. Included though were all the greatest hits from Lafayette’s original 1789 draft. Liberty, equality, security, property. Oddly enough though freedom of the press and freedom of religion were both conspicuously absent from the list. Although further legislation would ensure both.

[(15:51)](#!):

But counterbalancing these 22 rights was for the first time a list of nine duties. Duties like the obligation of each person to society consists in defending it, serving it, living in submission to the laws, and respecting those who are agents of them. And also every citizen owes his service to the fatherland and to the maintenance of liberty, equality, and property whenever that law summons him to defend them. So mostly the list of nine duties were just different ways of saying obey the law and put a uniform on if we tell you to.

[(16:31)](#!):

But number four did slip into a bit of the old Robespierre-esque belief that virtuous people make for a virtuous republic so it said no one is a good citizen unless he is a good son, good father, good brother, good friend, good husband. But mostly obey the law and put on a uniform when we tell you to. Continuing with the drive back to 1789 were the definitions of citizenship and suffrage.

[(17:02)](#!):

Although it was not explicitly stated in the constitution of year three, we are going back to the old active-passive-citizen distinction. So while everyone has legal and political rights and duties, a full citizenship and the voting rights that went with it were reserved for tax-paying males over the age of 21. No more of this universal suffrage business. But the franchise was actually even more restricted than that because once again we’re working on a two-tiered electoral system. Primary assemblies would select electors to go off to a further assembly where the actual delegates to the national government would be chosen, and to be an elector you had to clear a further property qualification that trimmed the list of actual voters down to just 30,000 men, which was even more restrictive than the constitution of 1791 had been.

[(17:58)](#!):

So what was this very small club of electors actually voting for? Well, one of the major innovations of the constitution of year three was that it ditched the single all-powerful legislative house and created a bicameral legislature. The dangers of an all-powerful single house with no check on its power and or whims had now been thoroughly internalized by everyone. And somewhere in Switzerland, I hope that Jean-Joseph Meunier is smiling.

[(18:29)](#!):

The lower house was called the Council of Five Hundred, which, wouldn’t you know it, had 500 members who had to be 25 years of age or older. This house would generate all new legislation. The upper house was called the Council of Ancients and would have 250 members who had to be 40 years of age or older. These guys would then have to approve or reject the legislation coming out of the lower house, and hopefully act as a check on any particularly crazy ideas.

[(19:03)](#!):

A further check on the power of the legislature was an executive branch independent from it. Now there was obviously a lingering fear that a single executive would lead to monarchy or dictatorship, so the independent executive branch was actually a five-man committee. A committee which gives the whole system of government its name, the Directory.

[(19:27)](#!):

The Directory would be tasked with implementing the laws passed by the Council of Five Hundred and approved by the Council of Ancients, but they would also have control over the military and foreign policy, both of which would pretty much be the exclusive domain of the Directors. They would also be responsible for all internal and external security. They would also appoint ministers to help them execute the laws, but those ministers would not run departments independently. It was more like day-to-day operations would be delegated to them, but the Directors would run the show.

[(20:03)](#!):

To check the power of the Directory, they were given no veto power over any legislation, and they also had no control over the public treasury or the budget, both of which were denied to them because nobody wanted the Directory to turn into the Committee of Public Safety.

[(20:22)](#!):

Now the last thing I’ll talk about here, since it’s going to play a direct role in the various political crises to come, is the tenure of all these elected officials. Election to the Directory would be for a five-year term, but to ensure some continuity, only one Director per year would be replaced, since the first slate of Directors would all be coming into office at the same time, the Constitution stipulated that each year, one of their names would be drawn from a hat, and then that guy would have to resign and be replaced.

[(20:55)](#!):

Once the Constitution had been in effect for five years, the Directors would just start rolling over when their five-year terms expired, but until then, who stayed and who went away would be a totally random affair. At least, officially random, because duh, there are going to be shenanigans with this. As for the Legislature, everyone’s terms would be for three years, with a third of the Delegates up for election each year. Okay, so far so good. But then the convention dropped what turned out to be a very controversial and unexpected bomb. The Law of Two-Thirds.

[(21:32)](#!):

The Law of Two-Thirds decreed that two-thirds of the Delegates elected to the first Legislature would have to be drawn from the ranks of the convention delegates. So only one-third of the seats would be subject to a truly open election. This is going to cause a major firestorm, so let’s talk this through a bit. Obviously, the announcement that the next election was not going to be free and open was very unpopular, and I’m reminded of nothing so much as the Rump Parliament during the English Revolution, with their irritating and ultimately self-defeating pushes for recruiter elections that would ensure that they themselves remained in Parliament forever.

[(22:14)](#!):

But there was some wisdom at work in the Law of Two-Thirds. The leaders of the Termidorian Convention had pinpointed Robespierre’s self-denying decree at the close of the National Assembly as one of the key turning points in the Revolution. And frankly, so do I.

[(22:31)](#!):

Clearing out all the National Assembly delegates in one fell swoop let a new cohort of radical leaders in to grab control of the subsequent Legislative Assembly. And none of those guys had a personal stake in actually trying to make the Constitution of 1791 work. So if the Termidorian Convention just opened up the polls to everyone, I mean my god, France might wind up back in the hands of a bunch of Royalists.

[(22:57)](#!):

So the Law of Two-Thirds was meant to ensure some strong political and politically Republican continuity in the national government. And given the subsequent response of those Royalists, I’m not sure that the Convention was wrong to limit the scope of these first elections. The Constitution of Year Three was approved by the Convention on August the 22nd. And as had been the case with the previous two Constitutions, it was sent out to the primary assemblies for ratification in the first week of September.

[(23:31)](#!):

Of the five million primary voters, four million did not show up. I mean my god, I think I’m just going to stay out of this. But of those who did show up, a little over a million said yes, and just 49,000 said no. But on the further question of the Law of Two-Thirds, which was apparently also up for ratification, things were a lot closer. Of those who decided to weigh in, 250,000 said okay, and 108,000 said no way.

[(24:04)](#!):

And that was just the raw totals. 19 different departments voted to reject the Law of Two-Thirds, and in Paris, 47 of the 48 sections voted against it. Everyone in the capital, the beaten-down leftists in the eastern sections and the rising conservatives in the western sections, wanted to see the bums in the Convention tossed out, and they were not happy they were not going to get a chance to do it. In particular, though, it was the conservatives who were the most inflamed by the Law of Two-Thirds.

[(24:37)](#!):

Since Termidor, their presses had flourished, their Muscatine youth had been encouraged to wander the streets freely, and the white terror was proceeding out in the departments virtually unchecked. For the right wing, including all those closeted monarchists, the next step appeared to be sweep the elections for the next legislature and truly grab hold of power. But the Law of Two-Thirds was going to prevent that from happening, so the right was understandably ticked off. Recognizing that these conservatives now posed a major threat to the stable implementation of the Constitution of Year Three, the cynical Termidorians started releasing a lot of the leftist leaders that had all just been locked up after Germinal and Prairieal, and were now encouraging them to go back to their people and start preparing to fight in case the dread royalists decided to make a power play.

[(25:32)](#!):

As I’ve said, the Termidorians are interested in staying in power, and they are going to make a real sport of encouraging and then repressing and then encouraging again the various partisan wings whenever one side started to get too strong. The other thing they did was start transferring regular army units into Paris, which put everyone on alert that the convention was getting ready to impose the Constitution of Year Three by force. The convention announced the vote totals on September the 23rd, 1795, which was actually the first day of Year Four.

[(26:09)](#!):

The Constitution, they said, has been ratified overwhelmingly, and so has the Law of Two-Thirds. But to make sure the vote on the Law of Two-Thirds was more decisive than it really was, the convention provocatively threw out a number of results from the Paris sectional assemblies, because those assemblies had reported back unanimous rejection rather than actual vote tallies. So this ratification announcement set off a chain reaction in Paris. But as I’ve hopefully now successfully foreshadowed, the looming popular insurrection would not come out of the poor eastern sections, but rather the better-off western sections, the guys who had just been defending the convention during the insurrections of Germinal and Prairieal.

[(26:56)](#!):

The angry meetings and organizing and collecting of arms in the western sections to fight the Law of Two-Thirds finally got going in earnest when word came on October the 4th that a spontaneous royalist uprising about 40 miles west of Paris had been suppressed by force of arms. This news led seven of the western sections to declare themselves in insurrection, and that means that it’s time for Napoleon Bonaparte to make his second great appearance on the stage of world history, and the one that would keep him there permanently.

[(27:32)](#!):

When last we saw young Bonaparte, now all of 26 years old, he had masterminded the successful final attack that ended the Siege of Toulon in December 1793. In recognition of his talent and accomplishment, he was named General of Artillery for the Army of Italy, which was operating along the Alpine frontier.

[(27:54)](#!):

Now I haven’t talked much about this theater of the war, because it’s mostly been a back-and-forth stalemate while everyone concentrated on the real war up in Belgium. But that said, in the first half of 1794, General Bonaparte did have a chance to show off a little, and he drew up the plans for a nifty little campaign that helped the French win some strategic strongholds in the Alps in the spring of 1794. The events of 9 Termidor, though, temporarily threw Bonaparte’s position into doubt, because obviously he was connected to the Jacobins, and had been promoted at the behest of Augustin Robespierre, who has by now fallen out of a window and gotten his head chopped off.

[(28:35)](#!):

But after being investigated, the young general was ultimately returned to duty. He took part in a failed attempt to reassert French dominion over Corsica, an attempt that was blocked by the superior British navy. And then in the reorganizations that followed the victories in the Netherlands, and the withdrawal of Prussia from the war, Bonaparte was reassigned to the Vend\xc3\xa9e, to serve as a general of infantry.

[(28:58)](#!):

But this being both a war not suited for an ambitious glory seeker like Napoleon, and a demotion from artillery to infantry, Bonaparte pleaded ill health, and said, cough cough, I just can’t make it. He wound up being reassigned to the Bureau of Topography in Paris, but his continued unwillingness to take up his post in the West led to his name actually being stricken from the list of active duty generals in September 1795. So this really threatened to derail his military career. But then Providence intervened to put young Bonaparte back on the road to destiny.

[(29:38)](#!):

With an insurrection brewing in the western sections, the convention turned, as they had on 9 Termidor, to Paul Barras to lead their counter-insurrectionary forces, forces which amounted to about 6,000 regular army soldiers. But if you’ll recall, Barras had spent his time as a representative on mission down in the southeast, and he had been one of the main political leaders supervising the siege of Toulon, and so he knew Napoleon Bonaparte well. So even though Bonaparte was technically an ex-general, Barras could think of no one better to actually leave the counter-insurrectionary forces on the ground.

[(30:18)](#!):

On the night of October 4, 1795, a detachment of the regular army moved to the center of the insurrectionary sections, and secured promises from the local leaders that they would stand down and disarm. But as soon as the army pulled back, it was all, haha, just kidding.

[(30:36)](#!):

So on the morning of October 5, 1795, that is, 13 Vend\xc3\xa9miers, year 4, something like 25,000 Parisians rolled out of bed, grabbed what weapons they had around, and started gathering for a march on the convention. This time in support not of bread in the constitution of 1793, but in favor of the restored monarchy. At least, that was a good way to portray them in the press after their insurrection had been put down.

[(31:05)](#!):

Unfortunately for the insurrectionaries, they massed south of the Seine and had to cross the river to reach the convention, and their adversary, Napoleon Bonaparte, probably knew how to defend strategic bridge crossings before he knew how to walk. He deployed strong artillery garrisons at each of the bridges, and so when the mobs surged north, they hit a bunch of cannon-lined chokepoints. A standoff lasted into the afternoon, but at about 4.30 Bonaparte decided he was done messing around, and he ordered the artillery to just start firing.

[(31:42)](#!):

Now in his famously incomprehensible poetic history of the revolution, Thomas Carlyle quoted Napoleon as saying he drove off the insurgents with a whiff of grape shot. And so that’s sort of the legend that’s grown up around this incident. But really, there was a pretty good battle that ran steadily for about six hours, and further skirmishing went on into the morning.

[(32:06)](#!):

The insurgents never made it across the river, and never really threatened the convention, but it did take more than a whiff of grape shot to drive them off. And outnumbered as he was, the real reason Bonaparte probably won was that the insurgents ran out of ammunition before he did. The insurrection of 13 Vend\xc3\xa9miers wound up being an important milestone in the history of the French Revolution. For one thing, obviously, it paves the way for the inauguration of the Directory.

[(32:40)](#!):

For another, it was in thanks for saving the convention that Napoleon Bonaparte was given command of the Army of Italy, where he is really going to get going on the road to destiny. Finally, this was, finally, the last major popular insurrection in Paris. The last time that the citizens of the capital would attempt by mass force to impose their will on the national government.

[(33:08)](#!):

The eastern sections had already been disarmed, and their political institutions crushed. So now, in their final days before handing power over to the Directory, the convention would do the same for all the Paris sections. No more local assemblies, no more locally controlled national guard units, no more guns and no more cannons for anybody. And that meant that the days of insurrection are over.

[(33:36)](#!):

Next week, we will move into the first days of the Directory, introduce the Directors \xe2\x80\x94 well, a few of the important ones, anyway \xe2\x80\x94 and then get to following the various attempts to undermine and break the new Directory system before it could get settled in. The days of insurrection were over, yes, but that did not mean that the ambitious, the dissatisfied, and the visionary were going to stop lusting after power.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.43, The Conspiracy of Equals.

[(01:38)](#!):

The National Convention had convened on September 21, 1792, in the midst of a great national crisis. The insurrection of August the 10th had violently overthrown a thousand-year-old monarchy. A combined Austrian and Prussian army was practically at the gates of Paris. Fear of that army had just led to the horrible and bloody September massacres. It was a time of fear, panic, and paranoia. Now the official purpose of the convention had been to write a new republican constitution that would replace the failed constitutional monarchy laid out in the broken constitution of 1791. But taking office in the midst of all these crises, and with more springing up every day, the convention delegates wound up lurching from emergency to emergency without ever being able to get far enough ahead of the domestic insurrections, foreign invasions, economic catastrophes, and bitter internal power struggles to lay down the unconstitutional, ad hoc revolutionary government they had fallen into.

[(02:39)](#!):

And this went on for three solid years. The national convention, again what was supposed to be only a temporary constitutional convention, turned out to be the national government of France from 1792 to 1795. It presided over some of the most infamous episodes of the French Revolution and produced some of the revolution’s most infamous leaders. But the time has come for them to finally, finally lay down their burden and hand the nation over to an official constitutional government.

[(03:11)](#!):

Abundance for the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients was held on October 12, 1795, and then on October 26, the national convention met for the last time.

[(03:23)](#!):

At that final meeting, they tried to set a conciliatory tone for the future by declaring a general amnesty. All political prisoners would be released from jail, and all suspects in hiding were allowed to come out of the shadows. But this amnesty was not without exceptions. Employees were still persona non grata and liable to be executed if anyone caught them inside France. Anyone arrested in the most recent insurrection of 13 Vend\xc3\xa9miers remained in custody, and also all counterfeiters remained in custody because we hate counterfeiters. But other than that, hey, it’s a brand new day, so let’s turn over a brand new leaf.

[(04:02)](#!):

Of course, the other thing that the convention did on that final day was form themselves into an electoral assembly of France to decide which of their membership would move on to fill up two-thirds of the membership of the legislative council succeeding them. So really, it’s a brand new day, let’s turn over one-third of a new leaf, because we don’t really trust you with the other two-thirds.

[(04:24)](#!):

When the Council of Five Hundred and Council of Ancients met for their inaugural sessions on October 31, the first thing on the agenda of both houses was electing the first five directors, the men who would run the executive branch. The method of election was that the Council of Five Hundred would propose a list of acceptable candidates and the Council of Ancients would select the five they thought best, or at least the five they thought most likely to be functional bureaucrats without turning into power-mad tyrants.

[(04:53)](#!):

So the men they selected were, first, 42-year-old Louis-Marie de la Ravelier-Lapeau, who had been purged from the convention as one of the Seventy-Five back in 1793 and had to stay in hiding until after Termidor, at which point he was invited back to the convention and played a prominent role on the Committee of Eleven, which had drafted the Constitution of Year Three. He received the most votes and became the first president of the Directory.

[(05:20)](#!):

Next was la Ravelier’s ally in the Directory, 48-year-old Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Roubel. Roubel’s revolutionary career had started back when he was elected as a delegate to the Estates General. He had drifted in the Fournier camp, but come back a staunch Republican in the national convention. He was rarely in Paris, though, and spent most of his time as a representative on mission in Alsace, and when he was recalled, he joined the Termidorian Conspiracy. After the fall of Robespierre, Roubel went back out on mission and served as one of the negotiators in the recent treaty with the Batavian Republic. La Ravelier and Roubel were friends and allies, and they wound up forming one bloc inside the Directory.

[(06:05)](#!):

The other bloc was formed by an alliance of the two war technocrats in the Directory. First was Etienne-Fran\xc3\xa7ois La Tournure, a steady military organizer who would basically run the navy during his term in office. He would also be the first selected by lot to resign, so let’s not worry too much about him. The other war technocrat in the Directory was none other than Lazare Carnot. The great organizer of victory had escaped Termidor, with his reputation pretty much intact. Now, Carnot continued to put all his efforts into winning the war, but there were some lingering fears out there about his deep involvement with the terror government of Year Two. But no one really needed to worry on that front. Carnot was mostly interested in forging a stable and strong central government that would help him win the war. Far from being a leftist sympathizer, he is going to be the hammer that drops down on the conspiracy of equals.

[(07:04)](#!):

I should also probably mention in passing that Carnot was actually the sixth man selected to be a director, because the original slate included Emmanuel Joseph Sies, known commonly as the Abbessias. He was the guy whose hugely influential pamphlet, What is the Third Estate?, was good enough to lend its name to Episode 3.9.

[(07:25)](#!):

Now we’ll talk more about Sies down the road, since he is going to have a major hand in bringing Bonaparte to power, but we should note right now that he considered himself something of a constitutional genius, was ticked off that none of his recommendations had been folded into the Constitution of Year Three, and so refused to serve in the Directory even though he was voted into it. Mostly he’s going to go off and pout until he gets in on a plot to overthrow the system of government he despised, because it had not been his idea.

[(07:54)](#!):

The wild card in the Directory, and the man who more than any other came to define it, was Paul Barra. He’s popped up a few times now, obviously running the Convention’s forces during Termidor and Vend\xc3\xa9mieres, but I haven’t really given him a full introduction yet, because there was too much else to talk about. But since he’s basically the poster child for everything that turned out to be wrong with the Directory, let’s introduce him a little more fully. First of all, Barra was a noble, or ex-noble I should say, one of the very few left with any kind of influence or authority.

[(08:30)](#!):

And though he emerged in the late 1780s as a noble of the liberal variety, his motivation for supporting the Revolution was somewhat suspect. He was chronically in debt thanks to a gambling addiction, and he also kept company with various men of flexible morals and ladies of disrepute. So for Barra, the Revolution was mostly an opportunity to get out from under the scandalous debt clouds hanging over him so he could keep on gambling, and drinking, and hanging out with men of flexible morals and ladies of disrepute.

[(09:02)](#!):

And he was happy always to change his political stripes to suit the prevailing political winds. He served in neither the National Assembly nor the Legislative Assembly, and did not join national government until he was elected into the convention. At that point he tended to side with the Mountain over the Girondins, but was away on mission so often it didn’t really matter which side he took. He was, as I previously noted, the lead representative down in the Southeast as the Republic crushed the Federalist uprising, so he oversaw both the implementation of the Terror and the confiscation of a lot of property, both of which he deployed quite profitably.

[(09:41)](#!):

It should come as no surprise, then, that Barra was high on the incorruptible Robespierre’s hit list, which is what turned him into a principled Termidorian conspirator, and now, somewhat surprisingly, a prominent national leader. Inside the Directory, Barra tended to side with Le Ravelier and Rubel, but really he seemed to be running a program all his own. A program that involved him living as luxuriously as he could, making as much money as he could, and always keeping an eye out for opportunities to preserve his position at the expense of whoever. So, like I say, Barra is a poster child for the Directory.

[(10:21)](#!):

Now the big problem facing the Directors when they took office was that the French economy was in really bad shape. The previous winter had, of course, been one of the worst on record, and the effects of the long late freeze were felt in the harvest of 1795, which was not particularly good, and with the general maximum lifted, prices were still sky-high and commodities everywhere scarce. On top of that, the national government was once again stony broke, their hard specie reserves were down to nothing, their nationalized lands were now selling for a fraction what they should have thanks to the insane inflation rates. To address this problem, the Termidorian Convention had continued to print asagnat to pay their bills, but that only made everything worse.

[(11:06)](#!):

But wait a minute, you say, print asagnat? Didn’t you say just a few episodes ago that in the spring of 1795 the asagnat had fallen to 8% face value and was dead? Well, yes, I did say that, but it appears that I took some exaggerated notes I made about it too literally. The asagnat was not technically dead, it was still around, the Termidorian Convention kept printing them, and upon taking office, the Directory kept printing them.

[(11:31)](#!):

But the Termidorians at least recognized that there was a problem with printing all of these asagnats, and so they decreed in the summer of 1795 that taxes had to be paid 50% in kind. And then, when they were drawing up the salaries for the members of the Directory and the legislative councils, those salaries were all listed by bushels of wheat, not any kind of monetary amount.

[(11:55)](#!):

So when the Directory took over and found the coffers of the national government had run dry, they decreed another emergency forced loan. But in doing so, they all but admitted that the asagnat really were worthless, and accepted them at just 1% face value. This, even as they continued to pump out the paper money to cover daily expenses.

[(12:17)](#!):

There was now an estimated 40 billion livre worth of face value asagnats floating around out there, all of it basically worthless. Farmers refused to accept it as payment for their crops, demanding metal specie instead, but since specie had long been driven under the mattresses, if somebody did show up with coins to buy something, your first instinct was to believe that it was counterfeit. So it was ruinous to buy, and it was ruinous to sell. These were not happy times for anyone.

[(12:47)](#!):

There were, however, two groups who did stand to gain from the economic privations. The first were speculators in national land. Originally well-to-do bourgeoisie from the towns and cities, these speculators bundled up stacks of worthless asagnats, went down to the auctions that were held in their local departmental capitals, and bought up old church lands and emigre estates for pennies on the dollar. There was a rule in place that the land was not supposed to sell for less than 22 times what it had profitably produced in 1790. But with inflation running away with the economy, it was easy to get land for just two to three times the 1790 profitability level. And on top of that, with only a few people really able to bid, bribery of auctioneers and land surveyors was a pretty simple trick. So you could get land at scandalously low prices.

[(13:41)](#!):

So though the French economy was crippling just about everybody, if you had a little bit of a financial cushion, at least enough to get in on the speculation, you could get very rich very quick. Because often what you do then is turn around and either lease the land or sell the land to somebody else, demanding hard specie or in-kind payments.

[(14:04)](#!):

The other group that hoped to exploit the economic troubles was not aiming at financial gain, but rather political gain. And this group also happened to be the principal beneficiaries of the amnesty that had been declared at the end of the national convention. I speak of the old Jacobins, who had been driven underground after the Termidorian reaction. In the wake of the royalist Vendemire insurrection, the new leaders of the Directory hoped to make common cause with the old Jacobins. And so it was those Jacobins, more than any other group, who were invited to come out of the shadows.

[(14:39)](#!):

Now a few of the more prominent among them were prohibited from standing for election into the Directory’s legislative councils. But they were allowed to hold other, lower-level municipal offices, and more or less allowed to meet with one another without fear of harassment. But as we are about to see, many of those old Jacobins were not interested in reconciling with the new regime. They were interested in toppling it and returning to power.

On November the 16th, 1795, a few of these core ex-Jacobins formed a new club. Officially called the Union of Friends of the Republic. It soon became known as the Pantheon Club, because their meeting hall was right next door to the Pantheon. From the beginning, this club tended to attract men who had been involved in the government of Year Two. That is, the terrorists and functionaries of the great dictatorial committees. Among them were former members of both the Committee of Public Safety and Committee of General Security. And that included two of the four we talked about just last week. Both the Escape Barraire and gone-to-ground Vaudier. Collo de Bois and Bill Varenne, however, were specifically denied amnesty and left to rot in French Guiana.

[(15:53)](#!):

At the outset, most of the guys in the Pantheon Club were looking to rehabilitate themselves, reconnect their old political network, and maybe help bring the Directory back around to a more left-wing point of view. They did not like the greedy speculators who gobbled up on the land. They did not like the anti-democratic spirit of the Constitution of Year Three. The Pantheon Club soon attracted over a thousand members, though steep entry dues naturally led the membership to be well off. Democracy and equality were fine things to talk about, but much easier without the rabble making a bunch of noise.

[(16:30)](#!):

But gentlemen Jacobins were not the only ones let out of prison by the amnesty. Also among those released were various populist radicals locked up before and after the Germinal and Prairie Hall uprisings. The most prominent among that lot turned out to be Francois-Noel Babouf, everyone’s favorite proto-communist. Babouf, and his weekly paper The Tribune of the People, made a cameo appearance back in episode 3.41, ginning up support for Bread and the Constitution of 1793. But he had been arrested and his paper shut down back in January 1795.

[(17:07)](#!):

Finally released in the amnesty, Babouf wasted no time getting back to work, cranking out the first issue of The Tribune of the People on November 6. But Babouf’s time in jail had solidified and sharpened a few of his more radical ideas, and so when he started publishing again, he first of all took on the moniker, Gracas, for reasons I sure hope no one out there needs me to explain, and then he started expounding his ideas about how to fix the economic mess that benefited so few and hurt so many. He was now calling for total land nationalization, collective farming, and equal distribution of the produce of the land.

[(17:48)](#!):

But before we get into Babouf’s revolutionary communism, we should back up a bit, because he’s an interesting dude with some interesting ideas. Babouf was born in 1760, and his father was a small-time excise tax collector, and his mother was a servant, so Babouf himself spent his formative years in a degree of poverty. There is apparently no record of how he came by his education, whether he was self-taught or if his parents managed to scrape together enough to send him to school. But he emerges as a young man in the 1780s, as a sort of highly skilled domestic servant who was an expert in the intricate rules and obligations of seniorial law.

[(18:29)](#!):

He was basically the guy who advised the local lord what peasants owed and how to get it out of them. But far from thinking the system he was now an expert in just, Babouf came to despise it, and when the call went out in 1789 for everyone to drop their grievance lists in anticipation of the coming Estates General, Babouf, by then having given up his old line of work, wrote the section in his own local assembly calling for the total abolition of feudalism.

[(18:60)](#!):

After the revolution got going, Babouf then spent the next five years living a very checkered life, bouncing between local municipal office, a prison cell, independent journalism, another prison cell, municipal office again, a prison again. He basically couldn’t stop saying and doing things that got him thrown in jail. Just before Termidor, he managed to dodge a 20-year sentence for allegedly altering some deeds while serving as a local administrator, though it’s hard to tell whether he actually did it or whether he had just ticked off the wrong people. So he moved to Paris after Termidor and took up the Pentagon, setting up the Tribune of the people in October 1794 as a way to defend the old terror regime and call for the implementation of the Constitution of 1793. Also bread. We need bread.

[(19:52)](#!):

And that’s when he first intruded into our little story. The Termidorians then got sick of him super quick, shut down his press, and locked him up in January 1795. While Batbeuf was bouncing through this checkered career, he got to thinking about the problems of the inherently unjust and unequal society everyone lived in, and how France was so rich and so fertile, and yet so many citizens starved. His final bout of prison time, spent among many other persecuted leftists, seems to have turned him decisively towards what is generally described as a form of agricultural communism.

[(20:29)](#!):

Though in his younger days, Batbeuf had focused mostly on the idea of setting up a small-scale community that would collectively farm and share the wealth, and in this he wasn’t much different from other socialist utopians, certainly no different than the diggers who were saying basically the same thing a hundred years earlier. But now Batbeuf was advocating this on a mass scale. That all land should be nationalized, all harvested grain should be deposited in publicly owned warehouses, and then distributed to the citizens of France on an equal basis. There was no reason why a rich landowner or a prominent doctor should get priority access to food just because they have the money to pay for it.

[(21:11)](#!):

Basically, all stomachs are created equal, and the entire system of food production and delivery should treat them as such.

[(21:21)](#!):

For these communal, equalitarian principles, Batbeuf has earned himself a place in the Marxist pantheon as an early kind of communist. But it is worth pointing out that Batbeuf was almost solely concerned with rural peasants, not urban workers. Batbeuf didn’t even really like people living in towns and cities, which he considered morally corrupting and generally a drain on the kind of agricultural labor that was needed to provide food for everyone. So he never spent much time thinking about, or advocating for, the rights of the urban worker. Or, most especially, trying to rally them to be the foot soldiers in the social, economic, and political revolution he was now aiming for.

[(22:03)](#!):

And in fact, it was this disdain, or at least disinterest, in organizing and playing to the urban mobs that led Batbeuf to what ultimately became his real innovative contribution to the development of revolutionary theory. If you’ll recall, Danton and his guys can be considered the first professional revolutionaries. They got together in the clubs and cafes of the old Cordelia district, consciously plotted a violent insurrection, toppled the old regime, and seized power.

[(22:35)](#!):

But their revolutionary program was specifically designed to be a popular uprising. The point was to lead the people in a mass insurrection to overthrow their oppressors. Batbeuf’s innovation was to drop the masses from the program. He pretty much thought the common people were a bunch of ignorant dupes who could not be relied on, and their political masters, to be self-interested demagogues who would betray the people the first chance they got.

[(23:02)](#!):

So what Batbeuf proposed instead was that a small cadre of dedicated conspirators could get together, launch a lightning coup, set themselves up as a dictatorship, and impose their social and economic revolution from the top down.

[(23:18)](#!):

So this is basically the beginning of party vanguardism, the idea that a close-knit group of revolutionary leaders need to seize power to usher in the sought-after anarchism or communism or whatever your revolutionary bag happens to be. The workers and peasants themselves are simply too complacent or too brainwashed to do it for themselves. So basically, Batbeuf is the spiritual godfather of Lenin.

[(23:47)](#!):

When Gracchus Batbeuf started printing his equalitarian ideals\xe2\x80\x94not the revolutionary vanguard stuff, of course, that was for private time\xe2\x80\x94the directory was immediately like, okay, this one is actually off his rocker, and we need to go re-arrest him. But when they came for him this time, Batbeuf managed to escape, and he remained hidden by friends and supporters. The tribune of the people continued to roll off the presses.

[(24:13)](#!):

And Batbeuf was also initially shunned by the members of the Pantheon Club, as exactly the kind of dangerous radical they did not need in their midst. But a few of the members of the Pantheon were not happy with the complacency and moderation they saw around him, and they sort of liked what Batbeuf was saying. And so a secret club within the Pantheon Club began to meet and seriously discuss how to retake power, and these guys became known as the conspiracy of equals.

[(24:44)](#!):

This inner club then turned back around and started working on their friends and associates in the wider Pantheon Club and saying, hey, you know, this guy Batbeuf might actually be onto something. By the end of 1795, the tribune of the people was being regularly read aloud at the Pantheon Club, where it was met by pretty enthusiastic applause. Batbeuf and the slowly but surely resurgent left was helped along its road to resurgency by the continued failure of the economy. Winter had now truly settled in, and people were starving to death and freezing to death once again. Batbeuf even wrote a little song about it called Dying of Hunger, Dying of Cold.

[(25:26)](#!):

The settling in of Winter also brought with it the final, final collapse of the Asignon, and I mean that seriously this time. The directory finally decided that they just couldn’t keep pumping worthless paper out into the economy. They needed to start over from scratch. On February the 19th, 1796, they closed the presses and then held a ritual ceremony within which all the printing plates were broken.

[(25:55)](#!):

At this same moment, the directory also seems to have suddenly realized that the left was getting resurgent. So pulling a classic Termidorian pivot, they ordered the Pantheon Club to close its doors on February the 26th. Now to put the slightest veneer on this sudden about-face, they also closed a few right-wing clubs, but this was clearly about re-repressing Jacobinism. The newly re-prescribed Jacobins were then booted from whatever petty offices they had taken up. Now the main upshot of this particular round of repression was to convince even more of those guys that Batbeuf was right, that there could be no reconciliation with the regime. And shortly thereafter, Batbeuf’s own rhetoric picked up the pace. In issue 40 of the Tribune of the People, he applauded the September massacres and then called the leaders of the directory a bunch of starvers, bloodsuckers, tyrants, hangmen, rogues, and mountebanks.

[(26:54)](#!):

As they were being assailed from the left, the directory then tried to figure out how it was going to keep the economy functioning now that they had abandoned the Asenya. What they came up with was a moderately kind of good idea, but one that was going to fail spectacularly in practice. Basically the idea was to start all over with a brand new paper currency. So they invented this piece of paper called the Territorial Mandate, which, like the Asenya, would be ultimately redeemable for a portion of national lands.

[(27:27)](#!):

But the Mandate was doomed from the start. On the day the first one rolled off the presses on March 18, 1796, it was immediately being traded at just 80% face value. This quick devaluation was then further exacerbated when the directory decreed that an Asenya out in circulation could be redeemed from Mandate at a 30-to-1 exchange rate, but out in the market they were being traded at like 400-to-1. So people started cashing out their Asenya for Mandates, but then those Mandates themselves plummeted in value as a result.

[(28:03)](#!):

As had been going on for a while now, the only people who benefited from all this were speculators, who could quickly swap out their worthless Asenya for slightly less worthless Mandates and then turn around and buy up national land for a song. Accompanying this roll out of the Mandates, the directory then got going with the potentially dangerous plan to start weaning Paris off of their subsidized food rations. The rations had never been technically free-free, but all you had to do was show up with a few Asenya and you could pick up your allotment. On March 25, though, the directory announced that they were raising the price of the ration.

[(28:45)](#!):

Now politically this was of course very dangerous. Messing with hungry Parisians had never been the smartest thing in the world to do. But the men who had been elected into the legislative councils of the directory had never been happy with the program that had built up after August 10, that is, prioritized the citizens of Paris at the expense of everyone else. It had long been the secret dream of many of the delegates to stop Paris from leeching off the rest of the country. And frankly, since the capital had never been weaker politically, they may as well take their shot right now.

[(29:21)](#!):

So with the financial system collapsing and not really being revived, and Paris continuing to starve and freeze, Babouf and his cadre of vanguards got together on March 30 and officially formed an insurrectionary committee. But there were not enough hardcore members of the conspiracy of equals to pull the coup off, so Babouf had to be convinced to form an alliance with the rerepressed gentleman Jacobins, the ones who had scorned him and then praised him and now wanted in on his insurrectionary movement.

[(29:54)](#!):

But to bring them, their influence, and hopefully some of their money, into the fold, Babouf also had to be convinced to modify his aims. Look, we can’t just go all in on nationwide equalitarianism on day one. Let’s start with something simple and go from there. So they decided that the most viable wedge they could use to overthrow the Directory was to become the champions of the Constitution of 1793. It worked before, kinda, but maybe it’ll work better now. Babouf reluctantly agreed.

[(30:29)](#!):

The conspiracy of equals then designated agents to go out and try to drum up support. Though a general popular uprising was not really what Babouf was aiming at, it would help to have men scattered around Paris priming everyone to get ready for the big day. More important than that, though, were the agents sent to the regular army garrisons and the new police legion of Paris. The mob may not be that important to the plan, but professional men under arms were going to be vital to pull off the lightning coup. If the conspiracy of equals could turn the men protecting the Directory against the Directory, well then boys, we are in.

[(31:11)](#!):

The regular soldiers camped at the garrison near the Champs de Mars were a tough nut to crack. But it turned out that some of the men in the new police legion were open to persuasion. So what was this new police legion that you’ve never heard about before? Well, I’ll tell you. After the convention started systematically disarming Paris and shutting down their locally controlled national guard units, there needed to be some kind of force in the capital to keep order. So the convention had formed a new police legion, about 7,000 strong, that was controlled by the central government, not by the people of Paris.

[(31:47)](#!):

But clearly the loyalty of these guys has not yet settled in, and so when the conspiracy of equals agents came sniffing around, there was some positive interest. But there was not going to be nearly enough interest to pull the coup off. The problem for the conspiracy of equals was that they simply did not have the financial resources to bribe the people they needed to bribe to induce a full-blown mutiny.

[(32:13)](#!):

By early April, word was not only leaking around all over the place that something was up, but the people of Paris seemed to be getting genuinely excited about Babboeuf and his call for the equal distribution of food. Facing its first very real crisis, the Directory was paralyzed. Rubel, for example, was afraid of cracking down too hard on the leftist agitators because he was still personally more concerned about the Directory’s right flank.

[(32:40)](#!):

Meanwhile Paul Barra was taking private meetings with some of the men connected to the conspiracy. Now Barra later claimed he had been trying to talk them out of doing anything stupid, but those guys subsequently reported that Barra had in fact offered to put himself at their head, or at the very least, let himself be taken as a hostage. Among the directors, the only one who seemed resolute was Lazare Carnot, and he wanted to crush this thing before it got off the ground, so that’s what the Directory did.

[(33:11)](#!):

On April 16th, at Carnot’s insistence, the Directory decreed that advocating either a return to monarchy or the Constitution of 1793 was now a capital offense. Then Carnot moved on the police legion. Suspecting them of being fatally compromised, Carnot transferred police power to the regular army and then ordered the police legion to the front lines to serve as an infantry brigade.

[(33:38)](#!):

Far more terrified of being sent to the front than they were actually supporters of the Conspiracy of Equals, three battalions within the police legion mutinied and declared for a baboof. They were suppressed and disarmed with almost no effort at all. And that was right around the time one of the inner circle members of the Conspiracy of Equals either got cold feet or turned out to have been a government plant all along. He delivered to the Directory all the details of the planned insurrection that was set for May 11th.

[(34:09)](#!):

With all the names, places, and plans in hand, Carnot simply waited until the conspirators started to put themselves in the places they were supposed to be on May 10th, then swooped down and arrested everybody. Baboof and his accomplices had no idea that they had been betrayed, and the crackdown, the raids and arrests caught everyone by surprise. The Conspiracy of Equals was completely broken. So the legacy of Gracchus Baboof and his revolutionary vanguard was not then for what they accomplished, because they didn’t accomplish anything, but for what they had been aiming to accomplish, and more importantly, the way they had been trying to accomplish it.

[(34:51)](#!):

Baboof himself is going to go down as a martyr, though he’s not going to be martyred yet \xe2\x80\x94 there’s one more little twist in the story, because they don’t actually kill him right away. But some of his accomplices were not killed at all, and they would go on to spread the memory and ideals and strategies that they had come up with in 1796. Ideals and strategies that would eventually be fed to the men who fought in 1830, and then 1848, and then 1870, and in a roundabout way, would wind up in the hands of, among others, Lenin and his Bolsheviks.

[(35:25)](#!):

So while we’ve dealt with the drama in Paris this week, we’ve been neglecting the war fronts, and so when we come back next week, we’re going to double back to deal with the struggles along the Rhine and the profidity of General Pishgrew, the success of General Hoche and the final suppression of the Vend\xc3\xa9e Uprising, and then of course get General Bonaparte over to Italy.

[(35:46)](#!):

So if you Google 10 American Presidents podcast, you’ll find it. You can also find it on iTunes, and I will also post a link to it at revolutionspodcast.com.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.44 The War Feeds Itself Since the Termidorians came to power, we’ve seen them beat down an insurrection from the left, then an insurrection from the right, and then just last week, another insurrection from the left. We’ve seen them disband the National Guard in Paris, set up a new police legion, only to disband that new police legion a few months later. So you may be asking yourself through all of this, if both wings of the political spectrum are trying to overthrow the new regime, how on earth are they still in power? The answer lies in the institution that will increasingly serve as the backbone of the directory, the army. The regular army played a crucial role in overawing the insurrectionaries of Germinal and Prairie Hall, and then of course under Bonaparte’s direction, regular army troops subdued the royalists of Vendemiere. And then last week, when the conspiracy of equals was exposed, Lazar Carnot transferred police power directly to the army. So today, we’re going to talk about the army, how it was being transformed into an institution with its own permanent interests, and how it fared in the campaigns of 1795 and 1796. Campaigns that helped transform it into an institution with its own permanent interests, interests that for the moment aligned with the directory, but we all know how this plays out in the end.

[(03:48)](#!):

Okay, so just to recap a little bit. Before the revolution, the French army was trending in a bad direction. Instead of modernizing through the 1780s, the French nobility had decided to turn the military back into an iron-clad stronghold of aristocratic privilege. The common soldiers were subjected to pretty draconian punishments, the non-noble professional soldiers were now forced to top out at captain, and all the top spots were reserved for the well-bred and well-connected sword nobility.

[(04:19)](#!):

After the revolution hit, two-thirds of the officer corps emigrated, including almost all of those old sword nobles, leaving an officer corps that had to be restocked by men who then naturally tied their career prospects to the success of the revolution.

[(04:36)](#!):

And the common soldiers were then augmented by passionate volunteers who made up for in zeal what they lacked in formal training, this all being brought to full fruition by the Lavet en masse, which eventually brought nearly a million men under arms, and then also the amalgam\xc3\xa9, which tied veterans to new recruits to quickly introduce rookies to the rules, responsibilities, and values of men under arms. The Lavet en masse also mobilized the entire nation to keep those soldiers fed, clothed, and armed. Forged in the crisis of 1793, this new French national army became a tidal wave that slowly pushed all its enemies back.

[(05:17)](#!):

But one of the major features of the army during this period of crisis, and one of the major innovations in the history of political warfare, was the representative on mission. Political commissars like Saint-Just had the final word in everything, ordering their generals when to fight and where to fight, and controlling all promotions and discharges. While the Committee of Public Safety reigned, the army worked for them. The aggressive zeal of the representatives probably had a lot to do with France not only surviving the great military tests of 1793 and 1794, but frankly emerging stronger than ever. After Termidor, though, a few subtle shifts began to take place. The all-powerful representatives on mission were recalled, and when the central government sent agents back to the armies, they no longer had the authority to treat the senior officers as subordinates.

[(06:10)](#!):

Yes, the generals were appointed by, and took their orders from, Paris. But that was about big-picture grand strategy. Day-to-day minutiae, the actual deployment of divisions, the hiring and firing of officers, that became the purview of the generals. And so it didn’t take long for fidelity to whatever happened to be the political ideology of the day to a client-patron relationship between the junior and senior officers out in the field. This led to the growth of an insular system of mutual loyalty among the officer corps who protected and elevated each other.

[(06:48)](#!):

This developing esprit de corps was cemented further by the deplorable state of the national finances in 1795 and 1796. It was getting harder and harder to keep the armies properly supplied. And so, for example, when the Army of the North invaded the United Provinces, they were basically told to live off the land, requisitioning whatever supplies they needed. This wound up working pretty well for the army occupying the Netherlands, not so much for the Dutch. And so the offensive campaigns of 1795, and then especially in 1796, which we’re about to get into, the government told the army to live off the lands they invaded. Basically, please open your hymnals to Livy, Book 34, Chapter 9. It happened to be the time of year when the Spaniards had the grain on their threshing floors. Cato, therefore, forbade the contractors to purchase any, and sent them back to Rome, saying, the war will feed itself.

[(07:47)](#!):

This change in the underlying supply logic had a couple of major impacts. First, it meant that to eat, the army needed to go out a-conquering. They could not afford to simply construct a defensive line along the Rhine and just sit there. Second, it meant that the men were now relying on their generals, not on their government, to keep them fed, clothed, and paid. Victory now meant full bellies and some cash. Defeat meant hunger and poverty. So if a general started to deliver spectacular victory after spectacular victory in one of the richest and most bountiful regions in Europe, well, who do you think you would give your allegiance to?

[(08:28)](#!):

After the run of treaties in the spring and summer of 1795 pulled the Prussians, the Dutch, and the Spanish out of the war, the French were left to face off against the British and the Austrians. But with the British mostly focused now on using their naval power to attack French colonial holdings on the other side of the world, or blockade French ports, that meant that the only land power that threatened France was the Austrians and their various little satellite principalities. So just as the Termidorian Convention was handing power to the Directory in the fall of 1795, they ordered their two major armies along the Rhine to go on the offensive with the intention of seizing all the major strongholds along the Great River, the central prize being the great fortress city of Mainz, the really central prize being all their money. The French armies in question were both a little over 60,000 strong and led respectively by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan in the north and Charles Pichagroux in the south.

[(09:31)](#!):

In between those two fueled armies, a third French force sat on the west bank of the Rhine next to Mainz, attempting to blockade the city, but unless it was enveloped from the east, Mainz would never fall. The overall strategy for the year was developed back in Paris by Lazare Carnot, who was convinced that a double pincer move, his absolutely favorite kind of move, could envelop and crush Austrian resistance. Now he might have been right about that. It might have worked, except that Pichagroux seemed suspiciously uninterested in holding up his end of the pincer.

[(10:07)](#!):

Opposing the French was, for the moment, the main Austrian army of the lower Rhine, though an army of the upper Rhine was being hastily cobbled together in the Black Forest to reinforce the southern Austrian defenses.

[(10:20)](#!):

So Jourdan crossed the Rhine first in early September, seizing Dusseldorf before turning south to approach Mainz from the north. The main Austrian army moved to deflect this advance, which allowed Pichagroux to cross the Rhine south of Mainz without any difficulty. Pichagroux then quickly captured Mannheim without firing a shot, but then he bungled away a golden opportunity to seize the main Austrian supply depot at Heidelberg, just a few miles to the southeast. Had he taken Heidelberg, the Austrian position along the Rhine might have become completely untenable and forced them to retreat deeper into their own territory. But instead of prioritizing the supply depot, Pichagroux only sent two divisions to capture it. And those two divisions were defeated by the Heidelberg garrison on September 24. It was a crucial blunder that may very well have been a conscious decision by Pichagroux to undermine his own campaign, because as would be discovered later, Pichagroux had by now opened up a treasonous correspondence with agents of the self-proclaimed Louis XVIII to discuss the logistics of restoration.

[(11:31)](#!):

That also helps explain why Pichagroux sat still in Mannheim and refused Jourdan’s request to merge their two armies for a solid envelopment of Mainz. Pichagroux’s stalling gave the newly formed Austrian army of the Upper Rhine crucial time to get itself together, race north to Heidelberg to get properly equipped, and then attack Pichagroux at Mannheim on October 18. Leaving a 12,000-man garrison to defend the city, Pichagroux pulled the rest of his forces back across the Rhine to regroup\xe2\x80\xa6 or, you know, not.

[(12:05)](#!):

Left on his own, Jourdan was stymied in his attempt to surround Mainz. The Austrian army of the Lower Rhine approached in a wide flanking maneuver that Jourdan attempted to deflect over October 11 and 12, but the force he dispatched to cover his open left flank failed to push off the Austrians. Now far too exposed to continue with the planned approach on Mainz and without any support from Pichagroux, Jourdan was forced to retreat back across the Rhine himself.

[(12:34)](#!):

With both of the main French armies repelled, the Austrians then swooped down on October 29 and attacked the French force blockading Mainz on the west side of the Rhine and drove them off. This was then followed up on November 10 with another attack on the west side of the river, this time against Pichagroux’s army, which drove the French into further retreat and left the poor guys trying to hold Mannheim totally isolated. They surrendered on November 22, ending the fighting for the year.

[(13:04)](#!):

So the brief campaign of 1795 did not go well for the French at all. Not only had they failed to capture any territory east of the Rhine, they had actually given up ground, and as winter set in, the Austrians actually sat on the west side of the river.

[(13:20)](#!):

Over that winter, rumors and accusations swirled around Pichagroux, with many suspecting that he had in fact been dabbling in treason. There was no official proof, yet, but when Pichagroux got all puffed up about his besmirched honor and offered his resignation in March 1796, the offer was accepted, much to Pichagroux’s surprise and dismay. But though that would be the end of Pichagroux’s military career, it will not be the end of his political career, as we will see next week.

[(13:56)](#!):

The strategy devised by Carnot in the Directory for the Campaign of 1796 was basically just a more ambitious retread of the campaign strategy for 1795, except this time without a treasonous general in charge of one of the two armies. The main theater would again be the Rhine, with the two French armies crossing in a great pincer to envelop the Austrians. To help relieve some of the pressure on those Rhine armies, though, Carnot also decided to open up a secondary front in Italy, a front that would hopefully tie up enough Austrian resources to give the French a free hand up in Germany.

[(14:35)](#!):

To open up this second front, Carnot, with some prodding from his fellow director Paul Berra, finally acquiesced to the demands of the super-ambitious 26-year-old Napoleon Bonaparte for a field command. After Vend\xc3\xa9e-Mierre, Bonaparte had been promoted to command the Army of the Interior, a reserve force that was now doubling as the Directory’s Praetorian Guard. That promotion had also come after prodding from Berra, who told his fellow directors, promote this man, or he will promote himself without you.

[(15:09)](#!):

But instead of giving Bonaparte the command vacated by Pichagroux, he gave the young general the 60,000-man Army of Italy, which was probably supposed to bury Bonaparte in the most disorganized and demoralized of all the French armies.

[(15:26)](#!):

But Bonaparte was not going to be relegated to obscurity that easily, nor did he think the command in Italy nearly as terrible as the politicians in Paris did. Remember, Bonaparte had served as a general of artillery in that same army in 1794, and had plotted its successful advance into the Alps and up the Riviera. Yes, the Army of Italy had been totally neglected. Pay was months overdue, they were badly clothed, many lacked shoes, supplies for everything were short. And on top of that, they weren’t really doing anything. The combination of idleness and deprivation was destroying morale, and led to mutinies cropping up with a disturbing regularity.

[(16:08)](#!):

So this was the army Bonaparte inherited in March 1796 for his very first field command. It was a command designed to break the spirit of a general, but instead Bonaparte looked around and said, there’s nothing here I can’t work with. Bonaparte started reorganizing and re-disciplining his men immediately, arranging the army to suit the theories he had been dreaming up and jotting down his whole life.

[(16:34)](#!):

And as for the campaign strategy itself, he developed that after poring over topographical maps and intelligence reports about the terrain and the positions of the enemy armies he was up against. The French occupied the Riviera, specifically the coastline up to the neutral Republic of Genoa.

[(16:54)](#!):

A raid against him to the north was, first of all, the Ligurian Alps, the mountain range that runs between the coast, and the rich and bountiful Italian Piedmont. Also standing between Bonaparte and the Piedmont were two armies. To the east, an Austrian force about 28,000 strong, and then to the west, a Sardinian army about 25,000 strong. The Kingdom of Sardinia, just so you know, was an independent client of the Habsburg monarchy and controlled not just the island of Sardinia that gave the kingdom its name, but also the Piedmont. Bonaparte’s plan was to split the Sardinians from the Austrians and force the kingdom to capitulate and exit the allied coalition.

[(17:38)](#!):

What came next was a lightning campaign that took the Austrians and Sardinians completely by surprise and formally introduced Napoleon Bonaparte to the world.

[(17:50)](#!):

Now the Austrians thought that Bonaparte was preparing to move against Genoa, so they sent their easternmost divisions to push back against the easternmost French divisions, which they did on April the 10th. But given the mountainous terrain and the limited mobility in the few passes available, Bonaparte recognized immediately that when the Austrian left wing moved down, the Austrian right wing became dangerously isolated. So Bonaparte force-marched his men up one of the central passes and absolutely savaged the Austrian right at Montenette on April the 12th, basically destroying that part of the army. This also left the French in between the Sardinians to the west and the remaining Austrians to the east. And this was the first great example of Napoleon’s strategy of the central position, which he would use over and over again in his career. When fighting two armies at the same time, plunge in between them, prevent them from linking up, overwhelm one, and then turn around and overwhelm the other. And that’s exactly what he did on this maiden campaign.

[(19:02)](#!):

Leaving a rearguard to watch the Austrians, the French turned west and plunged hard at the Sardinians, pushing them into a fighting retreat, with Bonaparte’s army relentlessly pursuing them. A series of running battles culminated at Mundo V on April the 21st, where the exhausted Sardinians were beaten badly, leaving the road into the Piedmont wide open to the French.

[(19:27)](#!):

The Sardinian general asked for an armistice, but Bonaparte pushed out onto the plains and grabbed as much territory as he could until the King of Sardinia finally offered total capitulation on April the 24th. The Sardinians were knocked out of the war, and the French were now allowed free passage through their territory. Bonaparte had achieved in two weeks what the French had not been able to accomplish in three years.

[(19:55)](#!):

But Napoleon was just getting warmed up. Having conquered the Sardinians, the rump of the shell-shocked Austrian army retreated east into Lombardy, eventually crossing over to the north side of the Po River. But instead of heading straight for them, Bonaparte took his army on a wide flanking move, eventually crossing the Po at Piacenza, which was well east of the Austrians, who were not at all expecting an attack to come from that direction.

[(20:22)](#!):

This sudden appearance of the French forced the Austrians to pull back again. Bonaparte’s army gave chase, and finally caught up with them at a river crossing in the town of Lodi. The Austrian rearguard was left to hold the bridge across the river while the rest of their army escaped. The resulting Battle of Lodi is famous for two contributions to the mythical lore that would soon surround Napoleon.

[(20:48)](#!):

First, Bonaparte had always been interested in the minutiae of warfare. And at Lodi, he allegedly took to sighting some of the heavy guns himself, a job usually done by a corporal, and this is the most famous, if apocryphal, version of the story of how Napoleon earned the nickname, the little corporal. Second, Napoleon himself later wrote that it was after his victory at Lodi that he became quote, certain that he was a man of high destiny. After an artillery duel and running push across the bridge, the French crossed the river, but the main Austrian army had by then made good its escape.

[(21:30)](#!):

Now the immediate result of Lodi was that it left Milan defended by just a few thousand isolated Austrians holed up in the city citadel. So Bonaparte was able to just roll into the great city. He demanded money, provisions, and supplies of all kinds, and he got them.

[(21:49)](#!):

The month before, the army of Italy was the poorest and most demoralized of the French armies. It now controlled all of northwestern Italy, some of the richest land in Europe. His men were now not only paid on time, they were paid in hard specie, metal coins not worthless paper. They no longer starved, they ate like kings. Men used to dread being assigned to the army of Italy. Now it was the best gig in the whole war.

[(22:21)](#!):

After getting driven back again and again, the Austrians set up a line to protect their central defensive fortress for the whole of northern Italy, Mantua, which would become the central focus of the war in Italy for the rest of the year. But when the French got rolling again, the Austrians were unable to hold a key river crossing at Borgetto on May the 30th and had to abandon Mantua and withdraw north, leaving 12,000 men inside the fortress to hold off the inevitable French siege until, hopefully, they could be relieved.

[(22:56)](#!):

Watching all of this unfold to their north, the rest of the Italian peninsula became very very eager to come to terms with Bonaparte now that they were all defenseless. In exchange for peace, the various city-states of Italy, and most especially the Pope himself, offered up supplies of all kinds and riches of all kinds up to and including gold bullion. The French also requisitioned and plundered at will, recklessly at the beginning, but now more methodically and ruthlessly.

[(23:29)](#!):

By midsummer, crate upon crate of riches were being sent back to Paris to restock the depleted French treasury, much to the delight and amazement of the Directory. But while the Directory got its fair share, Bonaparte and his senior officers peeled off quite a bit of all this for themselves. The campaigns in Italy made them all rich men. The economic benefits of raw conquest were becoming apparent to everyone. So we’ll leave Napoleon and his men there for the moment, because remember his campaign in Italy was supposed to be merely a distraction for the main theater of the war up on the other side of the Alps.

[(24:12)](#!):

Now back up along the Rhine, Jourdan was once again in command of the Northern Army, now numbering over 70,000. And to replace the possibly treasonous Pichagreu, the Directory promoted Jean-Victor Moreau.

[(24:26)](#!):

Moreau was the son of a lawyer, and he had a natural flair for leadership that was apparent all the way back to his student days. He joined the army in 1791, and served through the wars along the Belgian frontier, moving rapidly up the ranks. He was promoted by Carnot to be a divisional general in early 1794, and was a key part of the French victories in the spring of 1794 that turned the whole tide of the war against the Allies, and helped make Robespierre’s initiation of the Great Terror so damned inexplicable.

[(25:01)](#!):

Now as I said, the plan for 1796 was a more ambitious version of the plan for 1795. Jourdan would cross the Rhine across from Dusseldorf, Moreau would cross down near Mannheim. They would push the Austrians back, the siege Mainz, and then plunge as deep into enemy territory as they could, because the war now needed to feed itself.

[(25:25)](#!):

But facing the combined 140,000-odd French soldiers were 170,000 Austrians, which you think would preclude a successful French invasion. But those 170,000 men had to be dispersed all over the place to defend various cities and towns and strong points, whereas the French were able to better concentrate their forces so they tended to have a numerical advantage in whatever region they happened to be passing through. The Austrian general who would face this invasion was 25-year-old Archduke Charles, who I probably wouldn’t even bother mentioning except 1. He gets really high marks for the campaign he’s about to run that successfully repels both French armies, and 2. He will eventually go down in history as one of Napoleon’s most capable opponents. So just as 26-year-old Bonaparte was emerging into the annals of military history down in Italy, the 25-year-old Charles, who I believe is destined to take the field against Napoleon more times than any other commander in history, is doing the same up in Germany.

[(26:37)](#!):

Speaking of Bonaparte, his campaigns in Italy did indeed clear out some breathing space for his comrades up along the Rhine, and so when they got moving in June 1796, the Austrians had already been forced to peel off 25,000 men to go relieve Mantua. Jordan once again crossed the river first, and Archduke Charles was forced to pull his army back to the east side of the Rhine to protect Mainz.

[(27:04)](#!):

On June 15th, the Austrians attacked Jordan’s army at Wetzler and came away with an apparent victory that forced Jordan to scoot back across the Rhine. But the entire maneuver had really just been a distraction to allow Moreau’s army to fight its way across the Rhine against a much weaker enemy guarding the crossings to the south. So leaving behind a force to keep an eye on Jordan, Charles then raced down to try to stop Moreau’s advance. But of course, as soon as Charles was out of sight, Jordan re-crossed the river and pushed off the 35,000 or so Austrians keeping an eye on him, which is all they could really do since they weren’t strong enough to stop the French advance.

[(27:45)](#!):

Meanwhile, Charles arrived in the southern theater and intended to strike Moreau on July 10th, but Moreau decided to preempt him, attacked on July 9th, catching the Austrians a bit off guard in the Black Forest, turning their flank, and forcing Charles to retreat deep into his own territory. Now Moreau was convinced that this was just some kind of feint, and so he sat on his hands for a few days before realizing that Charles was actually running all the way back to the Danube. Moreau got off his hands and gave chase.

[(28:17)](#!):

For Charles’s part, what he was really looking for here was an opportunity to combine all his forces against one of the two invading French armies. But he was having a difficult time figuring out when and where that should be. And if the French should combine their armies, there would be no stopping them. They’d be able to push all the way to Vienna.

[(28:39)](#!):

So he moved as fast as he could southeast towards the Danube, hoping to draw Moreau along with him and most especially draw Moreau away from Jourdan, and Moreau played right into his hands. On August the 11th, a portion of Charles’s army launched a surprise attack on the pursuing French to pin them down long enough to get the rest of his army to the south side of the Danube, which they were able to do. With the Austrian army he had been pursuing now on the other side of this great river, Moreau had two options.

[(29:12)](#!):

A. Let them go, solidify the territorial gains he had made, link up with Jourdan, and become an unstoppable juggernaut that pushes all the way to Vienna, or B. Just keep moving forward, put even more distance between himself and Jourdan, and allow Charles to face them each separately. Moreau picked option B.

[(29:35)](#!):

Jourdan was making progress of his own though, and after depositing a force to begin the Siege of Mainz, he pushed deeper east. And by the middle of August 1796, both French armies were deep in enemy territory and were receiving a string of swift capitulations from the various Austrian-aligned principalities they passed through. Having to mitigate the French plundering, these principalities surrendered and laid down their arms. Not that it really helped them that much, the war will feed itself. Meanwhile down in Italy, Bonaparte was about to deal with that additional Austrian army that was being sent down to try to lift the Siege of Mantua.

[(30:15)](#!):

Now technically, the Austrians will succeed in lifting the siege, because when they came down through the Alps in late July, Bonaparte recognized that if he was going to defend his position, that he couldn’t leave anyone behind in Mantua. So he moved everybody north, and after moving around each other for a few days, the French and Austrians met at Castiglione on August 5th. The Battle of Castiglione demonstrated another early example of the battle strategies Napoleon would use to conquer Europe. This time, it is the move on the rear.

[(30:51)](#!):

Bonaparte sent the bulk of his forces on a full frontal assault of the Austrian line, but also sent 5,000 men on a wide flanking maneuver to come at the Austrians from their back left. When the Austrians repositioned to face this new threat, creating a capital L-shaped line, Bonaparte concentrated a massive force \xe2\x80\x93 infantry, cavalry, artillery \xe2\x80\x93 on the hinge point of the Austrian line, smashing through it and splitting the Austrians in two, which forced them into a disorganized retreat.

[(31:26)](#!):

The Austrians pulled back to the north, but in the meantime, they had managed to get a few divisions down to Mantua to reinforce and resupply the garrison, trash the French fortifications, and drag the heavy guns Bonaparte had been forced to leave behind inside the city. So, it wasn’t a total loss.

[(31:48)](#!):

Meanwhile, back north of the Alps, Moreau himself was now crossing the Danube and was following its southern bank east deeper and deeper into Austrian territory. And that is when Charles finally got the break he had been looking for. A cavalry officer who had been scouting Jourdan’s movements in the north recognized an opportunity to hit Jourdan’s rear flank. He sent a breathless report down to Charles saying, send 10,000 reinforcements like right now and we can beat them. Charles did not waste any time. Leaving 30,000 behind to continue giving Moreau something to futz around with, he raced north with 27,000 men and hit the spot his officer had identified and boy did it ever work. On August 24th, the Austrian army in the north turned around at Amberg and hit Jourdan straight on. While that battle was unfolding, Jourdan was then suddenly hit from the back right by Charles’s 27,000 men. With this dagger lodged in his ribs, Jourdan had to break off his advance and retreat northwest back towards the Rhine. This retreat was harried the entire way by Charles who shadowed Jourdan to the south, above all making sure that the two French armies would never link up.

[(33:07)](#!):

The decisive battle in the north finally came at Wurzburg on September 3rd. Jourdan turned around and struck at what he thought was an isolated Austrian division that he completely outnumbered, but instead it turned out to be a well supported and well reinforced forward unit of Charles’s whole army. The battle ended whatever hopes Jourdan had of staying on the east side of the Rhine, and he was forced to re-cross the river. When he did, all the various little sieges the French had set up with the Austrians pushed so far back had to be abandoned, most especially the Siege of Mainz, which for the second straight year resisted French attempts to capture it.

[(33:48)](#!):

When word finally reached Moreau that Jourdan had not only been turned around, but was headed back across the river, he looked around and was like, wow I am really super deep in enemy territory and suddenly all by my lonesome. So he turned around, re-crossed the Danube, and started heading back towards the Rhine himself, now being pursued by the Austrian army that he had so recently been chasing.

[(34:13)](#!):

Moreau was well aware that he needed to beat it back to France before Charles could swing down from the north and cut him off. There was a pretty dicey moment when the territory surrounding the bridgehead Moreau and his army had come over on was captured by the Austrians, forcing Moreau to turn and head due south, marching parallel to the Rhine through the Black Forest, racing for the next major crossing, which was near Basel, Switzerland. Charles caught up with Moreau a few times, and the retreat turned into a fighting retreat, but after one last battle at Schlingen on October the 24th, Moreau and his army got back across the Rhine.

[(34:54)](#!):

Now there might have been a slightly different end to all this if Bonaparte had done what the Directory had wanted him to do instead of just doing what he wanted to do. Well actually that’s not exactly right. What Bonaparte wanted to do was keep pushing east, take Trieste, and then use that as a springboard to come at Vienna from the south. But when he asked for reinforcements, the Directory said, no that is an insane plan, what we want you to do is move north into Germany to support Moreau. And Bonaparte almost did. But then he didn’t.

[(35:29)](#!):

Just as Jourdan was getting beat at Wurzburg in early September, Bonaparte started advancing north. His advance though just so happened to coincide with the second Austrian attempt to lift the Siege of Mantua.

[(35:42)](#!):

The Austrian relief army was divided in two, a defensive force guarding the western pass through the mountains, while the main invading force came down the eastern pass. The Austrian generals assumed that Bonaparte would mass his troops at the bottom of the eastern pass to block the main invading army, it made sense. But instead, on September 2nd, Bonaparte rushed up the western pass, and routed the greatly outnumbered Austrian defenders. Once they had retreated, Bonaparte then circled around to the east, and wound up coming shooting down the same pass the main Austrian invading force were themselves marching down. So Bonaparte was not sitting at the bottom of the pass waiting for the Austrians to emerge, he was chasing them from behind.

[(36:27)](#!):

The French caught the Austrians at Bassano on September 8th, and though the Austrians got away, they did have to ditch all their heavy guns and baggage. With almost no good options left, all the Austrians could do was head for the fortress they were trying to relieve, and the race for Mantua was on. But as hard as Bonaparte pushed his army, he couldn’t catch up with the Austrians, and they made it to Mantua first. They tried to hold a line outside the city to avoid getting trapped inside, but that did not work, and so they pulled back into the fortress.

[(37:02)](#!):

That meant that the garrison at Mantua was now 30,000 strong, which sounds pretty good, except you don’t really need that many guys to defend it, and all they were really doing is now using up the city’s limited supplies even faster. At the end of the day, they were simply trapped inside the city they had come to liberate.

[(37:24)](#!):

Whoops. So we’re going to leave off there for this week. While the Rhine campaigns are done for the year, this is not the end of the drama in Italy, because in between the second and third attempts to lift the siege of Mantua, Bonaparte will have taken it upon himself, against the orders of the Directory, to start personally reorganizing the political map of Northern Italy. This, of course, leads to fears that Bonaparte was aiming for something more than just a respectable military career.

[(37:53)](#!):

So next time, we will pick up with the new Italian Republic Napoleon invents out of thin air, and then move on to the next great political test for the Directory, the first round of free elections, which will wind up being a crushing defeat for the incumbent Termidorian delegates. I say next time, though, because I am taking next week off, but when I come back, there will be no weeks off between now and the end of the French Revolution.

[(02:18)](#!):

Episode 3.45, The Fall of Mantua. So welcome to the final stretch drive of the French Revolution. Mrs. Revolutions is getting more and more pregnant by the day, so I have eight weeks to get to the coup of 18 Brumaire. So no sense wasting time, let’s get right into it.

[(02:40)](#!):

To start today, we need to circle back around to the dying embers of the insurrection in the Vend\xc3\xa9e. There was so much talk last time about Italy that I couldn’t make it back around to the west, but that was partly because there isn’t much left to get back around to. When we last left the region, Lazar Hoche had just crushed the Qui Bron Bay expedition back in July 1795, and then marched south into the Vend\xc3\xa9e. There, he was joined by the Army of the Pyrenees. No longer required to man the Spanish frontier, these troops marched north to support the final pacification of the west. Under Hoche’s direction, these two armies pinned the last Vend\xc3\xa9e rebels against the Atlantic coast. Now the Comte d’Artois, the younger brother of Louis XVI and thus younger brother of the now self-proclaimed Louis XVIII and himself, the future Charles X, held out hope that the insurrectionary west would still be the great launching pad for restoration, and he landed with a small emigre force in late 1795, but by then there was no further support from the British and the rebels were hopelessly outnumbered. Most everyone else in the Vend\xc3\xa9e had settled into grudging acceptance of the Republic as long as they were left alone to live and worship how they pleased. So d’Artois got back on his boat and sailed away.

[(04:04)](#!):

General Hoche then spent the next few months advancing methodically, locking down territory, giving the rebels nowhere to go, nowhere to get supplied from, there was no way in, there was no way out. In early 1796, the final act played out. Hoche finally cornered and captured the last Vend\xc3\xa9e general in February 1796 and had him shot by a firing squad the following month.

[(04:28)](#!):

Three years after the insurrection began in response to the revolutionary attacks on the Catholic Church generally, and then the lev\xc3\xa9e of 300,000 particularly, the war in the Vend\xc3\xa9e was over. It had been a vicious, bloody, and bitter struggle that killed somewhere on the order of 250,000 people. The Vend\xc3\xa9e Uprising is very little known today, but it was by far the most destructive and deadly part of the whole French Revolution. Compared to what happened in the Vend\xc3\xa9e, the couple of heads rolling into a few baskets in Paris seems positively humane.

[(05:08)](#!):

The final victory in the Vend\xc3\xa9e left the Directory with an interesting question. Between the Army of the West and the Army of the Pyrenees, it now had tens of thousands of Republican soldiers freed up to do whatever. What do we do with them all? The obvious answer was march them east to reinforce the armies of Jourdan, Moreau, and Bonaparte, who were all preparing to invade Austrian territory. But depending on how you did the math, the armies massing against Austria now numbered 200,000 to 300,000 already. So maybe we can use the men in the West to open up a new front in the war. So while some men were transferred east, many more stayed behind to take part in the Directory’s big new fancy plan. Invade Ireland. This is going to turn out to have been a horrible idea.

[(05:59)](#!):

But besides the coming disastrous invasion of Ireland, the victory in the Vend\xc3\xa9e also created an unexpected political problem for the Directory. Finely abandoning hope of restoring the monarchy by force of arms, Royalists inside France turned their attention to the ballot box to achieve their ends. If the monarchy could no longer win in the field, maybe they could win the next election and then dismantle the hated Republic from the inside. So despite their flameout in the West, the political right was actually feeling pretty good about their position in the summer of 1796. The Directory’s crackdown on the leftists, following B\xc3\xa9boeuf’s aborted conspiracy of equals, meant that the right was being treated pretty leniently these days. Their papers operated without harassment, they met with each other out in the open. Then the Conservatives got a further boost in September 1796. After the Directory arrested B\xc3\xa9boeuf and his associates, the conspirators were held at the army garrison at Grenelle, that is, right off the Champs de Mars outside of Paris. The remaining rump of left-wing Jacobins got it into their head that they could incite a mutiny of this garrison, free B\xc3\xa9boeuf, and ride the momentum all the way into power. It was well known that the garrison in Paris was getting antsy. It used to be pretty awesome to be stationed in the capital, safe and secure and well away from the front lines. But now that the French armies had gone on the offensive, especially the Army of Italy, word was coming back that their comrades were out there bathing in riches and glory while the Paris garrison sat bored and underpaid in the capital. But as the Jacobins soon found out, that did not mean that they were ready to overthrow the government on behalf of some left-wing lunatics.

[(07:47)](#!):

After some allegedly careful planning, three or four hundred armed Jacobins mustered on September 9th and marched on the Grenelle garrison. They thought they had made good contacts inside the garrison and that they were about to trigger a mass uprising, but the Jacobin ranks were absolutely riddled with informants, and the Directory knew all about everything well in advance. When the Jacobins arrived, they were greeted by a regiment of fully loyal troops. The whole thing collapsed in a couple of minutes. Most of the Jacobins got away, but the army rounded up about 130 of them, and of those, 30 would be executed a month later by firing squad.

[(08:26)](#!):

This semi-delusional spasm of left-wing radicalism only helped further legitimize the conservatives. But as it was turning out, the conservatives were not a unified bloc. On the one hand, you had arch-conservative absolutists. For them, the goal was nothing less than the full restoration of the monarchy with all its ancient rights and privileges. On the other were constitutional monarchists, guys who had been revolutionaries in good standing until the insurrection of August 10th pushed them all out. They believed in trying to restore something like the Constitution of 1791, with a few adjustments to make it more stable.

[(09:08)](#!):

One of the biggest differences of opinion amongst these royalists was when we say bring back the king, who do we mean? For the absolutists, this was obvious, Louis XVIII. But the constitutional monarchists gagged on this idea. Louis XVIII had shown himself to be a belligerent reactionary. Restoring the French monarchy was going to be hard enough without trying to build it on the back of some arrogant prat who spit on everyone who didn’t have royal blood. So the constitutionalists looked to the junior branch of the royal house and pushed for Louis Philippe, the son of Philippe Galletet and now the new Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans. Chances were good that the average French citizen would be far more willing to accept the moderate Duc de Orl\xc3\xa9ans as king than the reactionary Louis XVIII. But despite their differences, the two sides tried to forge a political coalition that would help them win the spring elections, elections that we’re going to talk about next week, and then they would all start working to restore the monarchy. What that restored monarchy would actually look like was a fight for another day.

[(10:17)](#!):

Now as the conservatives gathered strength, though, General Napoleon Bonaparte was doing his best to make the legitimacy of the Directory iron-clad by continuing to kick the snot out of the Austrians in Italy. But though his victories reflected well on the Directory, it was also clear that young Bonaparte was very much his own man.

[(10:41)](#!):

In the lull between the second Austrian attempt to relieve Mantua in September 1796, that’s what we ended with last time, and the coming third attempt to relieve Mantua in November 1796, that’s what we’ll get to in a second, Bonaparte consolidated French holdings in North Italy.

[(11:06)](#!):

The Kingdom of Sardinia would remain the Kingdom of Sardinia, defeated and under French occupation. But further to the east, Bonaparte experimented with creating independent French-aligned republics out of the mishmash of Northern Italian duchies, provinces, and city-states. On October 16th, he called together representatives from four of these territories and proclaimed them to be the Cispedane Republic, Cispedane being the old Roman designation for territory south of the Po River, a river they called the Padus.

[(11:40)](#!):

With a capital in Bologna, the government of this new republic was modeled on the French Directory, a five-man executive committee governing in conjunction with a bicameral legislature. From Bonaparte’s perspective, the primary responsibility of the new republic would be to clamp down on any local insurrections against French occupation and then keep the French army supplied, and he’s so glad you agree with him about those responsibilities.

[(12:07)](#!):

A month later, Bonaparte would organize the territories that had been the Duchy of Milan into the Transpedane Republic, with a nearly identical administrative apparatus and responsibilities. But by the time that the Transpedane Republic was being proclaimed, Bonaparte was in the middle of getting beat and very possibly losing all that he had just acquired in Italy.

[(12:30)](#!):

By the end of October 1796, both of the French armies that had invaded across the Rhine River had been chased back into France by Archduke Charles. So, while Charles kept an eye on the Rhine frontier to make sure the French didn’t leave winter quarters, the Austrian high command was able to dispatch nearly 50,000 men for a third attempt to relieve Mantua. And Mantua was badly in need of relief. Remember, at the end of the last episode, the Austrian army that was supposed to have relieved the fortress wound up trapped inside. Overcrowded and with dwindling supplies to draw on, conditions inside the city were terrible. Within the first month, 4,000 men died from wounds sustained in the recent battles or disease. The only bright side to all this misery was that there were now fewer mouths to feed.

[(13:23)](#!):

As was their custom, the Austrians divided their forces in two. The main army of about 28,000 circled around and entered Italy from the east, while a second army of 19,000 came straight down from the north.

[(13:37)](#!):

Bonaparte, meanwhile, had a little over 35,000 men at his disposal, but he had to disperse them in four divisions of about 8,000 to 10,000 men each to cover all the approaches to Mantua, the say-nothing of the siege itself, which required 8,000 men to maintain. So really, he’s only got about 28,000 men available for his field army. This latest campaign, which is going to go pretty bad for the French until the very end, naturally got off on the wrong foot. Bonaparte was badly misinformed about the size of the force approaching from the north. The Austrians had taken pains to conceal their deployments, and the army that started marching south at the end of October was literally twice as big as Bonaparte expected. That’s why he posted just one of his 10,000-man divisions to cover the past 19,000 Austrians were now marching down.

[(14:33)](#!):

Not realizing the extent of the danger to the north, Bonaparte concentrated the rest of his forces to deal with the army coming in from the east. One of his divisions had been stationed in the town of Bassano along the Brenta River, but with the bulk of the Austrian army approaching, this outnumbered division left Bassano and its river crossing to the Austrians and rendezvoused with Bonaparte, who was coming up with 83,000 men to try to stop the Austrians from crossing the river. Now by the time the French arrived back at Bassano with 19,000 men on November 6th, most of the 28,000 Austrians were already on the west side of the river.

[(15:10)](#!):

Bonaparte ordered an attack to try to drive them back, and an all-day battle ensued that saw heavy casualties on both sides. But at the end of the day, Bonaparte had failed to push the Austrians back, and he ordered a retreat. The Austrians attempted to pursue him, but Napoleon had his armies moving faster than anything on earth these days, and they pulled away and regrouped at Verona, about 80 miles to the southwest. Also, incidentally, were the two converging Austrian armies planned to link up.

[(15:42)](#!):

The Battle of Bassano was the first time Napoleon Bonaparte had been beaten in the field. Of course, he sent a dispatch back to the Directory, reporting a great victory, because of course he did.

[(15:56)](#!):

While the main armies were battling over Bassano, the action in the north saw the Austrians just push the outnumbered French back. The French made a valiant stand over November 6th and 7th at Calleano, but when the Austrians snuck some guys around behind them, some of the French troops panicked and fled, which broke down the whole line. The running battles over the last week had taken its toll on both sides. The Austrians had lost 3500 killed, captured, or wounded. The French had lost 4400, almost half of their total forces, and they retreated all the way back to Rivoli.

[(16:31)](#!):

Meanwhile, not too far to the south now, an advanced Austrian force of about 12,000 approached Verona on November 12th and took position on a ridge north of the town of Caldiero. On a totally crappy, hail-filled day, Bonaparte dispatched 13,000 men to go push the Austrians off the ridge. The French started to make a little progress, but then a second Austrian force arrived, and the French had to retreat again. So this is not going well for Bonaparte at all. His armies were getting beat on all fronts, they were outnumbered, and there was no relief in sight. The two Austrian armies were now dangerously close to linking up, and if they did, their combined weight would be too much to overcome. Napoleon came very close to abandoning the siege of Mantua and pulling back to Milan right then and there.

[(17:24)](#!):

But then he got lucky, which is one thing all great commanders have in common. From time to time, they just get lucky.

[(17:34)](#!):

Austrian communications and intelligence during the campaign were horrible. The army approaching from the north believed that the French troops in Rivoli had been reinforced by another 10,000 men, so they halted their advance. No one told them that those men had actually been fighting at Bassano and were now in Verona with Bonaparte. Then the main Austrian army coming in from the east slowed their advance rather than pushing down hard. This moment of hesitation led Bonaparte to say, screw it, let’s just go for the jugular and see if we can win this thing.

[(18:08)](#!):

Leaving skeleton crews to man both Mantua and Rivoli, dangerously exposing both his flank and his rear to attack, Bonaparte cobbled together 18,000 men to go attack the 23,000 Austrians arrayed against him east of Verona. Revisiting the maneuver he had used when he came down out of the Piedmont, Bonaparte marched his men southeast out of Verona on November the 15th, following the southern bank of the Adige River. His plan was to march underneath the Austrians, cross the river in their rear, and then come at them from behind, hopefully capturing their baggage and cutting them off from their line of supply and retreat.

[(18:49)](#!):

What followed turned out to be a three-day extravaganza called the Battle of Arcole that if I described in all its back and forths and regular bridges here and pontoon bridges over there, multiple columns moving in multiple directions across and beside two different rivers in marshy country that limited everyone to using causeways and diked off dry ground, it would take me a whole episode to get through it all. So we’re not going to do that. By far, the most famous incident in the battle came on the first day of fighting. With his men pinned down trying to get across a bridge to take the town of Arcole, hence the name of the battle, Bonaparte got a little carried away trying to rally his men. He grabbed a flag, strode out into the open waving it and urging his men to attack.

[(19:39)](#!):

Now this famous scene is inevitably depicted as Napoleon standing on the bridge waving the flag, but the official report says that the French hadn’t gotten that far yet, and he was actually 55 paces back. Still, pretty gutsy stuff. Eventually, his staff was able to hustle him back to cover without getting shot. The French eventually took Arcole late that night, then lost it the next day, then nearly got pushed all the way into full blown retreat before regrouping at the end of the third day and taking the city back for good. With the French now poised to cut them off, the Austrians retreated to protect their line.

[(20:19)](#!):

The battle of Arcole decided the campaign. The Austrian army coming down from the north finally recognized how weak the Rivoli garrison was and drove them out of the city on November 17th, but that was the same day that the main Austrian army was getting beat at Arcole, and they were now in retreat. With basically no hope now of linking up, the northern army retreated back up into the mountains. The Austrians tried to re-coordinate their offensive, but the communication lines were too drawn out, and they couldn’t get anything going. By the very skin of his teeth, Bonaparte had staved off a third attempt to relieve Mantua.

[(20:57)](#!):

With the Austrians’ hold in Italy slipping away fast at the end of 1796, the Directory moved forward with its plan to open up a new front in the war against the British. That new front being Ireland. So as Bonaparte battled the Austrians, General Hoche prepared his army for an invasion of the British Isles. Now we don’t have the time to get into all the comically horrible details of the Irish expedition, so here is the quick and dirty version of it.

[(21:30)](#!):

When the Revolution got going in France in 1789, Irish patriots were inspired to form political clubs to espouse revolutionary principles and hopefully get the ball rolling on independence from the English. These clubs were tolerated until the British declared war on France in 1793. After that, the clubs were forced underground. But by then, they had built up a pretty good patriotic network and had agents in Paris trying to secure French assistance.

[(22:01)](#!):

Obviously, the French were busy all through 1793 and 1794 and 1795, but by 1796, the Directory was suddenly open to the idea. France’s armies were on offense against the Austrians, so why not go on offense against the British? Irish patriots promised that if the French could land 15,000 regular soldiers and plenty of supplies, that they could raise 250,000 patriotic Irishmen. Together, they could all push the English out of Ireland and leave revolutionary France with a gun pointed at England’s exposed ribcage.

[(22:39)](#!):

Hoche built up an invasion force of 15,000 to 20,000 men and gathered arms and equipment for the Irish rebel army. But the French navy stationed in Brest was kind of a mess. They had been getting kicked around by the British navy for a while. What officers they had were second-rate, and the crews were men pressed into service. None of them had any experience doing what they were about to try to do.

[(23:05)](#!):

As the invasion fleet started to come together over the fall of 1796, Hoche sent them out on a practice run. It was botched so horribly that it threw the logic of the whole operation into doubt. The invasion was planned for December to catch the British off-guard. But on the eve of the launch, Hoche himself was so pessimistic about the operation that he wrote to the Directory saying, I would rather lead this army anywhere but Ireland. When he received no reply from his superiors, he led 44 ships out of Brest on December 15. The next day, the order arrived from the Directory, canceling the expedition.

[(23:44)](#!):

From that point on, it was a month of pure hell for everyone. The weather in the North Atlantic in December is never good, but December 1796 laid down some of the worst storms ever recorded. As soon as they left port, the fleet was scattered. Ships then sank in the storms with no hope of rescuing the crews. The flagship containing Hoche, the commanding French admiral, and all the senior officers was blown away from everybody else, and they were never able to link back up.

[(24:14)](#!):

Deprived of their senior officers, the 30 or so ships who managed to link back up decided to keep going forward and sailed for Bantry Bay. But when they finally got there, the weather turned even worse. Even more ships were blown away, destroyed, or sunk. The remaining officers tried to launch a landing, but the weather was just too horrible. Then more boats blew away or sunk. The crews and their passengers either drowned or wound up on the overcrowded ships remaining. With all hope of success drained out of the expedition, the officers left in charge called it off on December 29 and sailed back to France. The return voyage was no better. The weather got even worse, and by now the British finally had ships of their own launched from Winter Dock and were harassing the well-passed beleaguered French. Two weeks later, whatever ships were going to make it back finally made it back.

[(25:09)](#!):

I cannot find hard counts on the total losses, but back-of-the-envelope math says at a minimum a third of the men who embarked on December 15 did not return. From start to finish, the expedition was a complete and total failure. Not one French soldier set foot on Irish soil.

[(25:29)](#!):

Just so I don’t get yelled at by my British fans out there, I will throw in one little epilogue to this tragic misadventure. A month after the debacle, a separate phase of the already failed invasion of Ireland inexplicably went forward. Stepped with British guns seized at Quiberon Bay, 1,400 French landed at Fishguard in Wales on February 22, 1797. This landing was originally supposed to be a diversionary measure to distract the British from the main landing in Ireland, but since the invasion had already failed spectacularly, I’m not really sure what these guys were doing. After two days of random skirmishing with the locals, including\xe2\x80\x94and I’m not making this up\xe2\x80\x94an angry Welsh woman with a pitchfork, the invaders surrendered en masse on February 24. The Battle of Fishguard is traditionally recognized as the last time a foreign army set foot on Great Britain. Back in Paris, the Directory absorbed the news of the disaster, but they had neither the time nor the inclination to dwell on it. They had much bigger things on their plate, because just as the scope of the failure in Ireland was being relayed from the west, the opposite news was coming in from the east. Bonaparte had just scored a major victory against the Austrians, and was now poised to drive all the way to Vienna itself.

[(26:56)](#!):

The near success of the third attempt to relieve Mantua encouraged the Austrians to give it one more try. So as 1796 gave way to 1797, they organized another 50,000 men for yet another attempt at relief. Their plan was to basically come at the French from the same directions as last time, but with two differences. First, this time the main army of 28,000 would be the ones marching straight down from the north, while the flanking army of 18,000 took the road in from the east. Second, these armies would operate independently of one another. The attempt to coordinate had been a fatal weakness of the third attempt, so this time the Austrian generals were told to handle their own business and not worry about what the other guy was doing.

[(27:45)](#!):

They knew where Napoleon had stationed his forces, and also knew that the French were down to maybe 30,000 men split over three 10,000-man divisions, one manning the northern approach at Rivoli, one holding the middle at Verona, and one manning the eastern approach out around Vicenza. So both the 28,000 Austrians coming down from the north and the 18,000 coming in from the east would surely have the numerical advantage in their respective spheres.

[(28:16)](#!):

Both Austrian armies converged on the French divisions in the second week of January 1797. The flanking Austrian army of 18,000 easily passed through the 10,000 French troops strung out like a net around Vicenza. One of the Austrian columns then hit Verona on January 12th, but were repulsed. The rest of the Austrians, though, just passed right on through and headed for Mantua. So far, so good. Meanwhile up north, 28,000 Austrians were descending on just 10,000 French manning the high plateau north of Rivoli.

[(28:52)](#!):

Napoleon waited until he understood the relative sizes and dispositions of the two armies coming at him before he determined what to do. When it was confirmed that the northern army was indeed the main army, Bonaparte made a quick and decisive decision. On January 13th, he ordered the 8,800-man division in Verona to abandon the city and force march overnight for Rivoli. He gave the same order to a 4,000-man reserve force. Then he himself mounted a horse with a few of his staff and raced up to take personal command of the coming battle.

[(29:28)](#!):

When the Austrians began their attack on Rivoli on the morning of January 14th, they had a nearly 3-to-1 advantage. But instead of just ramming down the middle and overwhelming the 10,000 French men trying to hold the line, the Austrians broke up into six different divisions, who then attacked in three different columns. About 12,000 came right down the middle, 14,000 came around the French right, and one division of 4,500 swung all the way around to the left to eventually come at the French from behind.

[(29:60)](#!):

This was all supposed to be a methodical envelopment, but really, it just negated their numerical superiority long enough to allow the French defenders to hold the line until help arrived. Also lending the French a helping hand was the fact that the center Austrian column coming at them had to approach up very rough terrain, we’re talking goat paths, so they had almost no artillery to speak of. But even then, by around 9am the French left started to buckle, but by then the division from Verona had completed their forced night march through a snowstorm and Bonaparte was able to feed them into his weakened line.

[(30:41)](#!):

But just as the center was stabilizing, the 14,000 Austrians sent to attack the French right flank appeared. But critically, this force was divided between 5,000 dragoons and infantry on the near side of the river and a 9,000 man supporting artillery army on the far side, plus they all had to charge out of a steep ravine to reach the French position on the plateau. Bonaparte rejiggered his lines and concentrated heavy fire on the 5,000 men trying to come up out of the ravine, finally repelling them in disarray.

[(31:14)](#!):

As noon approached, the last piece of the Austrian plan, supposedly, finally reappeared from their wide march around the French left to appear in the French rear, but of course by then they were not going to be delivering the final blow, they were just an isolated 4,500 man unit. And that is precisely when the second wave of French reinforcements arrived, and trapped between two enemy armies, all 4,500 Austrians surrendered. With every line of attack having failed, the Austrians were forced to retreat north, but Bonaparte was not just going to let them get away.

[(31:53)](#!):

The next day, he divided his army in two, half were ordered to pummel and overwhelm the retreating Austrians, which they did with brutal effectiveness, and by the end of the day on January 16th, the French had killed, wounded, or captured 15,000 Austrians. Of the 28,000 who marched south, only 13,000 managed to escape back to the north. Meanwhile, Bonaparte himself led the other half of the army, mostly the division that came from Verona, to go pin down that other 18,000 man Austrian army currently headed for Mantua.

[(32:30)](#!):

Bonaparte led this division on a march that carried them 39 miles in 24 hours, and though they weren’t able to get between the Austrians and Mantua, they did something even better. They got around behind them. The Austrians found themselves pinned between the French forces besieging Mantua and this Bonaparte-led Verona division. Now isolated and surrounded, the Austrian army surrendered on January 16th. The Mantua garrison held out for two more weeks, but clearly it was now futile. On February 2nd, 1797, the fortress capitulated.

[(33:09)](#!):

The Battle of Rivoli and the capture of Mantua were debilitating blows to the Austrian fortunes in Italy. Once Napoleon became emperor and started his urban renewal plans for Paris, one of the new major streets he ordered construction through the very heart of Paris was named after this battle, which is why when you go to Paris today, you always find yourself in and around the Rue de Rivoli. But after capturing Mantua, young General Bonaparte did not even take time to consolidate his position. Next week, he will set out on an audacious march aiming straight for the Austrian capital of Vienna.

[(33:48)](#!):

Within two months, the Austrians will be arranging an armistice, setting the stage for the final treaty negotiations at Campo Formio in the fall of 1797, treaty negotiations that will end the War of the First Coalition, a war that had begun way back in the spring of 1792 and had done so much to determine the course of the French Revolution.

[(34:12)](#!):

But as we’ll see, while Bonaparte was winning the war for France, the Directory was facing a concerted attack on its very legitimacy. The first round of free elections in the spring of 1797 will be a disaster for the incumbent regime, leading to a six-month standoff between Republicans and monarchists that was finally ended in September, when the Directory launched the Coup of Fructidar.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.46 The Coup of Fructidor So we left off last time with the fall of Mantua in Italy in February 1797. This week I want to pick up right where we left off, push the Italian campaign through to the preliminaries at Lioban before hopping back to France to cover the elections of year 5, which will bring a whole bunch of conservative delegates into the legislative councils of the Directory.

[(02:24)](#!):

Ben will cover the events of the summer of 1797, culminating with the Coup of Fructidor in September, wherein the Directory will bail on the Constitution in order to save the Constitution, and the Treaty of Campo Formio in October, wherein the War of the First Coalition will come to an end.

[(02:45)](#!):

General Napoleon Bonaparte wasted no time getting back to work after the fall of Mantua. Capturing the fortress was a key part of his larger plans, but in and of itself it was just a thing to check off the list. Next up was charging at the Austrians and flat out winning the war. But before he could do that, Bonaparte needed to solidify his hold on Italy by wheeling around and smacking down the Pope. Napoleon wanted to make sure his holiness didn’t get any smart ideas when the French pushed their way out of Italy. So just days after the fall of Mantua, Bonaparte targeted a 7,000-man Papal army at Faenza, allegedly defending the frontier of the Papal States. A 9,000-man French division marched south, and the resulting battle wasn’t even a contest. The now highly trained, highly disciplined, and very experienced French troops endured no casualties, forcing the Papal army to surrender. On February 19th, the Pope signed the Treaty of Tolentino. This treaty required the Pope to hand even more hard cash over to the French and recognize the right of the French armies to loot valuable treasures and works of art from the Vatican. Included in this total capitulation was also a further ceding of territory both inside Italy and within the boundaries of France, because remember, the Pope still claimed sovereignty over Avignon and the Comte de Venison. Those Papal enclaves had been annexed by the French way back in 1791, but the Vatican had never recognized it. Article 5 of the treaty said, The Pope renounces, purely and simply, all the rights to which he might lay claim over the city and territory of Avignon and the Comte de Venison, and its dependencies, and transfers and makes over the said rights to the French Republic. And so that was the end of that.

[(04:41)](#!):

With his rear secured, Bonaparte then made ready to push his way out of Italy altogether and plunge into the heart of the Austrian Empire. With the situation now critical, Austrian Archduke Charles, the young hero of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, was sent down to try to contain the French army on the Italian side of the Alps, but there was very little he could do. The French Directory had finally woken up to the fact that Bonaparte was like, winning the war, and sent him a bunch of reinforcements, bringing his field army up to 60,000 men.

[(05:14)](#!):

He peeled 20,000 of those right off the top to garrison the Northern Alpine passes into Italy, and then himself led 40,000 across the Brenta River northeast towards the Austrian army, who were trying to hold on to their last little foothold on the Italian side of the Alps.

[(05:32)](#!):

Bonaparte’s main hope in rushing back onto the offensive was to drive through the Austrians before Archduke Charles really had a chance to organize a proper defense, and this is pretty much how it went. Charles allegedly had 50,000 men at his disposal, but they were spread out all over the place. Over the course of March, the French either captured the Austrian forces they encountered or forced them into a retreat. Bonaparte approached in two columns, he led the main force of 30,000 himself, while another 11,000 paralleled him a bit to the north. Those 11,000 men moved so fast that they were on top of the critical pass at Tarvis before Charles could send reinforcements. When reinforcements did arrive at Tarvis on March 21st, they found the French had already taken the pass. The Austrians managed to dislodge the French after a day of hard fighting, but the next day a French counterattack pushed the Austrians into a full-blown retreat, running back through the pass that they were trying to defend.

[(06:36)](#!):

They retreated so rapidly that 4,000 Austrians were trapped on the wrong side of the line. Surrounded and cut off, those 4,000 men surrendered on March 23rd. After the French captured Tarvis, Archduke Charles decided his position was untenable, and he evacuated Italy entirely, hoping to draw a new line of defense on the other side of the Alps. Bonaparte, meanwhile, was fanning his men out all over northeast Italy to hold down strategic points that he had just acquired like Trieste and Palmanova along the northern Adriatic, which he planned to now use as his supply and communications base for the push into Austria.

[(07:17)](#!):

At the same time, he ordered the 20,000 men he had left back guarding the northern passes above Mantua to go ahead and start advancing for a planned convergence deep in Austrian territory.

[(07:29)](#!):

Then on March 31st, Bonaparte sent a letter to Archduke Charles asking if the Archduke was interested in an armistice. I mean, you’re in it in a really bad way here man, so why should we spill further blood? Charles did not immediately respond, so Bonaparte kept up the pressure. But at that moment, the French forces were actually a bit spread out themselves, and Bonaparte’s position was not as strong as he was letting on. So to keep up the bluff, he ordered his men to march and march fast towards Vienna. They marched up through the Alps, and by April 7th had made it as far as Leoben, which was just 100 miles southwest of Vienna. And that is when Charles finally said, okay, stop. Austrian envoys arrived in the French camp asking for a five-day ceasefire. When that five-day ceasefire was up, it was renewed for a further five days. And when those five days were up, real talks to put a stop to the fighting got going in earnest. Negotiating on behalf of the Republic, with exactly zero authority to do so, Bonaparte and his Austrian counterparts agreed on April the 18th to what we now call the Leoben Peace Preliminaries.

[(08:46)](#!):

As we’ll see at the end of today’s episode, the terms of the preliminaries at Leoben formed the basis of the Treaty of Campo Formio. Austria ceded Belgium and the West Bank of the Rhine to France, and recognized the new independent republics Napoleon had created, and was still creating, in Italy.

[(09:05)](#!):

But at Leoben, Bonaparte included a controversial enticement to get the Austrians to say yes to the deal. Specifically, he offered them sovereignty over the heretofore neutral Republic of Venice \xe2\x80\x93 minus some of their strategic territories, of course. Since the main French ambition at this point was to secure the natural boundaries of France, getting Austria to abandon claims to everything west of the Rhine was the main goal, and offering Venice as compensation was a generous way of getting them to agree.

[(09:39)](#!):

But this would prove to be a controversial move by Bonaparte. For one thing, as I’ve mentioned repeatedly, he doesn’t really have the authority to be doing stuff like this. But for another, the revolutionary optics do not look good at all. For the most part, the French still believe they own the moral high ground in the war. They were a republic of citizens, freeing their fellow man from the despotic shackles of old Europe. And here Bonaparte was horse-trading territory like the most arrogant ASEAN regime diplomat.

[(10:11)](#!):

But Napoleon was able to justify screwing the Venetians, thanks to an ill-timed anti-French uprising in Verona, which was in Venetian territory. On April 17, the 400-man French garrison was attacked by locals and slaughtered. Bonaparte used this as an excuse to dictate terms to the Venetians with a very heavy hand. The Austrians agreed to all of this, and couriers were dispatched to the Rhine frontier to tell everyone over there to stop fighting. And those couriers got there just in time. Well, almost just in time.

[(10:47)](#!):

So just to wrap things up along the Rhine, you remember how General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan had basically been left out to dry by both Pichagroux in 1795 and Moreau in 1796? Well, as a reward for getting hosed by his colleagues, the Directory decided to blame Jourdan for the failure of the Rhine campaigns. As preparations for the renewed offensive in 1797, the Directory relieved Jourdan of his command. And in his place, they promoted Lazare Hoche, the conqueror of the west, whose flagship had eventually made it back to port after getting blown out into the North Atlantic during the disastrous invasion of Ireland.

[(11:29)](#!):

Hoche was pretty excited about the chance to rehabilitate his image. In the second week of April, he led his army across the Rhine and defeated an Austrian army at Neuveng on April the 18th. But within days of that victory, the messengers arrived with news that a deal had been struck at Leoben, a deal that would end fighting in Europe for two full years.

[(11:54)](#!):

Now as I mentioned last week, Bonaparte’s victories were really helping the Directory out, and news that he had brought the Austrians to their knees was really good news. But it did not come soon enough to save the regime from the political bloodbath they were about to endure. The national finances were still a total mess, and the French economy was still struggling even with the influx of all those spoils from Italy. The new territorial mandates, the paper currency that was supposed to replace the Asignon, were dead on arrival. Within six months of their creation, the territorial mandates were as worthless as the worthless Asignon.

[(12:34)](#!):

The Directory tried a few tricks over 1796 to try to prop up the new currency, but nothing seemed to work. In February 1797, the Directory admitted defeat and just stopped printing them. After that, no new paper currency would be issued. France returned to a money economy based on hard specie. The revolutionary experiments with paper money were over.

[(13:01)](#!):

All of these economic problems helped further bolster conservative arguments that the Republican government was itself the cause of all this misfortune. I mean, seriously, ask yourself, are you better off now than you were four years ago? Aside from a few speculators who everyone hated, the answer was no, not at all.

[(13:21)](#!):

So in the lead up to the spring elections, conservatives began to mobilize to exploit all the disenchantment. A new movement called the Friends of Order began to attract adherents, and they started setting up a new sort of political club called the Philanthropic Society to spread the conservative gospel of a return to the stability and normalcy of monarchy.

[(13:45)](#!):

But remember, within the conservative camp there was a split between absolutists and constitutionalists. So though they were all ostensibly working towards the same common goal of getting conservatives elected into the legislative councils, a small absolutist clique formed called the Legitimate Sons who still dreamed of overthrowing the republic rather than slowly undermining it from the inside.

[(14:11)](#!):

Some of these legitimate sons got it into their heads that the reason the army garrison at Grenel had been impervious to the overtures of Babeuf and the conspiracy of equals was because the garrison was secretly royalist. So in January 1797, the Legitimate Sons made their own play at using the Grenel garrison to launch a coup. But this plot was exposed in an even more proto-state than Babeuf’s attempted uprising had been, and the leading conspirators were all arrested. All this aborted attempt really did was prove to the other conservatives that the only way to go was victory at the ballot box.

[(14:51)](#!):

The elections of year 5 were held from March 21 to April 9, 1797, and with ominous conservative stirrings everywhere, the nervous directors tried to rig the vote by disqualifying potential royalist voters. Many former \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s had returned to France since Thermidor and were eagerly awaiting their chance to vote and vote conservative.

[(15:14)](#!):

But the Directory still had a list of officially prescribed \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s from the old days of the Committee of Public Safety, and they said, if your name is still on that list, you are not allowed to vote. Then, at Lazar Carnot’s insistence, the Directory ordered in early March that all candidates for the legislative council swear a hatred for both monarchy and the Constitution of 1793. This forced a lot of monarchists to either stay in the closet or stay at home.

[(15:45)](#!):

But none of this was enough to overcome the prevailing conservatism of the electorate. Well, that’s not exactly right. The prevailing attitude of the electorate was a combination of exhaustion and apathy. As usual, the turnout for the elections of year 5 was pathetic. It’s really one of the defining features of democracy during the French Revolution. There wasn’t a single election where turnout wasn’t comically low. But of those who voted, the conservatives formed by far the greatest part.

[(16:16)](#!):

234 members of the Directory’s legislative councils were up for re-election, all of them holdovers from the national convention. The voters re-elected, 11 of them. That’s it, 11. And those 11 were the most conservative of the lot. The rest were just turned out. 182 of the newly elected delegates are identifiably royalist, and 0 could even be called left-leaning. Which means that this resounding defeat of the incumbent regime was not just a defeat of the Directory per se, but also everything that has happened since August 10, 1792.

[(16:59)](#!):

This was of course alarming to the remaining committed Republicans in the Directory. Those committed Republicans were led by the little three-man triumvirate within the five-man Directory. So we’re talking about Louis-Marie Laravalier, Jean-Francois Rubel, and Paul Barra. Though Barra was always a wild card, the catastrophic losses in the election seems to have driven him into a working alliance with Laravalier and Rubel to preserve the Republic at all costs. One more election like that, and the royalists would actually have working majorities. Rubel suggested they annul the election results right then and there. But Lazar Carnot, their slightly more conservative colleague in the Directory, retorted with the crazy notion that the directors ought to work with the councils the voters elected. If we don’t respect the elections, then what are we all doing here? Now if those delegates break their oath and support monarchy, we can deal with them then.

[(18:01)](#!):

When the new Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients met for their first sessions though, they did nothing to alleviate the fears of the triumvirate. The Council of Five Hundred elected newly-minted delegate General Pichagrew to be their president. Pichagrew still enjoyed the glow that came from being the man who had conquered the Netherlands, and his treasonous correspondence with Louis the Eighteenth was at that point merely suspected at the highest levels. It was not common knowledge, nor was there any proof of his treason. But still, Pichagrew, in charge of the Council of Five Hundred, was a warning shot across the bow. The first order of business for the incoming council was replacing the first director who would be selected by lot to resign. Luckily, for all the major players, the name of the inconsequential Francois-\xc3\x89tienne Latogneur was selected from the hat. This is reported to have been a genuine luck of the draw, but I personally have a really super hard time believing that, especially given what is going to happen down the road.

[(19:06)](#!):

To replace Latogneur though, the councils appointed Francois-Marie de Barthelemy, a conservative diplomat whose claim to fame was negotiating the Treaty of Basel that removed Prussia from the war. The triumvirate was not at all happy with the selection, but there was nothing that they could do about it. One of the big reasons Barthelemy was a provocative choice is that one of the key issues on the directory’s table was negotiating the end of the war with the Austrians.

[(19:37)](#!):

You would think that ending the war would be pretty non-controversial, but there was a disagreement among the directors about the best response to Austria’s weakness. The triumvirs were in favor of even more aggressive expansion. The war machine is finally fired up, it’s finally kicking ass, so why stop now? Oh, also the spoils of war are just about the only thing propping up our national finances.

[(20:05)](#!):

But Carnot and Barthelemy both advocated signing a peace treaty to bring the long and costly war to a close. In general, opinion in the legislative councils trended towards supporting a peace treaty, but even among those who wanted the war to end, opinion was split.

[(20:23)](#!):

Conservatives wanted to make a generous peace with the Austrians as a first step toward securing foreign support for the restoration. The old Termidorians, meanwhile, wanted to extract serious concessions from the Republic’s enemies, and those Termidorians had a key ally, the army. The army was not at all thrilled about rumors that the politicians back in Paris were going to return territory to the Austrians that had been captured by their sweat and blood, so the alliance between the Republicans in the directory and the generals and soldiers out on the frontiers got stronger.

[(21:01)](#!):

Speaking of that newly won territory, General Bonaparte was seriously just still off on his own and continued to organize Italy to his own specifications. Pro-revolutionary elements within the Republic of Genoesele decided to preempt direct French intervention by organizing a local coup in May to kick out the old oligarchic regime. They proclaimed themselves to be a French-aligned, Ligurian republic. The famous banking operations of Genoa were now at Bonaparte’s disposal.

[(21:34)](#!):

But the political reorganization of Italy wasn’t going 100% smoothly for Bonaparte. The Cispedane Republic, the first new republic Napoleon had created, held its own initial round of legislative elections in April 1797, and just as had happened in France, the electorate returned a slate of very conservative, very anti-French delegates. This was much to Bonaparte’s great annoyance, so at the beginning of July, he erased the Cispedane Republic and the Transpedane Republic from the map, and merged them into a single unit now called the Cisalpine Republic, with a capital in Milan. Milan was by far the most pro-French region Bonaparte had come across, so he submerged any nascent conservatism or Italian patriotism under the thumb of his Italian supporters in Milan. Back in Paris, Bonaparte’s unilateral reorganizations of Italy was met by fears that he was setting up personal client states for himself, that he could either use as the basis to form some new kingdom with himself as King Napoleon, or that he could use as a springboard to come back to France and set himself up as a dictator, and the fact that he had taken over a huge palace to serve as his headquarters allayed no one’s fears. But there was no possibility of just recalling him, or censuring him in any way. Even conservatives did not want to mess with his success.

[(23:08)](#!):

Over the summer, tensions in the Directory between the Republicans and their conservative colleagues heightened over the issue of the old non-juring priests. Though a big part of the Termidorian reaction had been the acceptance of freedom of worship and church-state separation, technically, refractory priests were still outlawed. The conservatives wanted to start easing up on this a little, but for the Republicans, it was one thing to tolerate those guys, and quite another to rehabilitate them completely. The Republicans were happy with the whole, we won’t actively come break down your door if you stay behind that door arrangement, but at the end of June, the Council of Five Hundred voted to repeal the law outlawing non-juring priests. The law was vetoed by the Council of Ancients, but still, it was obvious where this was all headed. The reactionary priests, who had done so much to turn France into a religious war zone, would soon be coming back out into the light, where they would no doubt fully support restoration.

[(24:16)](#!):

The other source of tension between Republicans and conservatives was the Directory’s revenues and expenditures. The legislative councils technically controlled the budget, but the Directory itself executed tax collections through its Treasury Ministry. But this ministry had become a hotbed of conservatism, and together with allies in the councils, the conservatives started annulling, cutting off, and or depriving the Directory of all its various revenue streams. The immediate goal was to starve the executive branch of funds to further prosecute the war, and so force them to agree to more lenient terms with the Austrians. The longer term goal was to break the independence of the executive arm, pack the legislative councils with monarchists, and then vote to invite the king to come home.

[(25:08)](#!):

None of this was lost on the triumvirate, who were now feeling like the conservatives were successfully outmaneuvering them. And this moment also happens to be the moment when the Directory was given final proof of Pichagrew’s correspondence with Louis XVIII.

[(25:24)](#!):

The dam in correspondence had actually been captured by General Moreau during the campaigns of 1796, but he and Pichagrew were old friends. Moreau was himself no royalist, but he didn’t want to rat on his friend, and so he sat on the evidence. Eventually, however, word of the letters reached Bonaparte, and he forwarded everything to Barra. So as it turned out, the current president of the Council of Five Hundred was in league with Louis XVIII.

[(25:55)](#!):

This revelation appears to have come as a complete shock to Lazare Carnot, who pivoted away from his argument that the Directory should passively respect the will of the voters. Not that this pivot would come fast enough, or be strong enough, to save Carnot from the events of Fructidor.

[(26:14)](#!):

In response to all this, the triumvirate took steps to secure their position. They ordered General Hoche to lead some men from the Rhine frontier back to the west, and if he wouldn’t mind coming by way of Paris, that would be just super. Now this was actually an unconstitutional order, as there were rules about troops in the capital. Aside from the Grinnell garrisons, Paris was supposed to be off-limits to the army, but the triumvirate was already getting over constitutional niceties. When Hoche and his men passed through Paris, the Directory had them stick around for a minute. Just to rest, you understand.

[(26:52)](#!):

Just for a minute. Once the troops were in Paris, the triumvirate then implemented a radical reshuffling of the executive ministries on July 14th. They appointed an ally to head up the Ministry of Finance, and his job would now be to reform and improve the Directory’s revenue streams rather than destroy them. Then they appointed Hoche Minister of War, a post Hoche accepted, but then quickly resigned a week later once he realized that the triumvirate was positioning him to possibly lead some kind of attack on the democratically elected legislative councils. And then of course there was the post of foreign minister. But the Directory was having trouble finding a man with the requisite experience and standing to take on the job. And that’s when Paul Barras said, well, I’ve got a guy. And that guy turns out to be, dun dun dun, Talleyrand. That’s right, July 1797 marks Talleyrand’s triumphant return to the public stage. Of course, if the triumvirs thought Talleyrand was going to run anyone’s program but his own, they were oh so sadly mistaken.

[(28:02)](#!):

So when last we left him, everyone’s favorite slippery card shark of an ex-bishop had been booted from England in 1794 and then exiled to Philadelphia, where he spent the next two years. As soon as he found out about the Termidorian reaction though, Talleyrand immediately set to work trying to get his name removed from the list of prescribed emigres. And in this, he had a key friend in Madame de Stalle, the daughter of Jacques Neckerre, who was just starting to become a key center of intellectual gravity in the Paris salon scene. She was close to Barras and through him managed to get Talleyrand’s name removed from the prescribed emigre list at the end of 1795.

[(28:46)](#!):

Talleyrand then happily ditched the United States in the spring of 1796. He landed back in Europe in Hanover, where he remained for a few months to get a feel for the situation before he actually re-entered France. I mean, who knew what the scene would really be like for a noble archbishop of questionable morals and a checkered political past.

[(29:09)](#!):

But with the coast appearing clear, Talleyrand came back to France in September 1796 and then proceeded to bide his time and wait for an opportunity to get back in the game. That chance is finally coming right now. The triumvirate needed ministers who had experience and who could maybe be trusted, and so Barras tapped Talleyrand to serve as foreign minister. But if the goal of this ministerial reshuffle was to preserve the Directory, putting Talleyrand in a key role was not the hottest idea going. As soon as he was inside the government, Talleyrand took a look around and said to himself, well, this is never going to last, I better start planning for the future. It took him exactly three seconds to survey Europe and go, whoa, who is this kid Napoleon Bonaparte who is kicking so much ass in Italy?

[(29:59)](#!):

Talleyrand immediately started up a regular correspondence with Bonaparte, sucking up to the young general and flattering his ego to the hilt. Talleyrand congratulated Napoleon on the deal he was striking with the Austrians, even if he kept his reservations about handing neutral Venice over to the Austrians to himself. So the coup of 18 Brumaire is officially in the making.

[(30:25)](#!):

Talleyrand entered the Foreign Office at an auspicious moment, but his own role in the subsequent negotiations would be a minor one. Bonaparte himself was leading negotiations with the Austrians, and negotiating envoys had already been sent to Lille to meet with the British to see what they wanted to do now that they were about to have no allies. But as the days and weeks ticked by in Lille, the French envoys started to suspect that the British were intentionally stringing them along, and they were right. British intelligence had it that the Conservatives were on the rise, and that if they waited, they could get a much better deal than the one offered by the current government.

[(31:05)](#!):

One backchannel recommending that they stall turned out to be the new Foreign Minister Talleyrand himself, who as I said believed from day one that the Directory was fatally flawed and would eventually collapse one way or the other. So it’s safe to say that Talleyrand spent his entire time as the Directory’s Foreign Minister arranging its demise. Oh, also making an absolute gobsmacking amount of money. He did that too.

[(31:34)](#!):

The combination of the influx of troops into Paris and the ministerial reshuffle led to perfectly justified fears inside the legislative councils that the Triumvirate was planning something. And those fears were not at all belayed when Hoche decided to resign as Minister of War and go back to the front. Because within a few weeks even more regular army troops had arrived in the capital. This time they came from the Army of Italy and were led by one of Bonaparte’s key lieutenants.

[(32:05)](#!):

As an institution, the army was clearly aligning itself with the current republican government. Napoleon himself had just told his troops that he would personally lead them all back to France with an eagle swiftness if he felt the republic was threatened. So inside the legislative councils, the delegates started discussing how to protect themselves. They tentatively approved a plan to rebuild the National Guard and in the meantime support irregular armed bands inside the capital, mostly drawn, I presume, from the Muscadins who had proved so useful to conservatives in the past.

[(32:42)](#!):

But none of these plans were going to roll out fast enough to stave off the Triumvirs who now believed that they had to destroy the constitution to save the constitution. At the end of August, conservatives once again attempted to repeal the laws against refractory priests and this time they got the council of ancients to agree. And that was when the Triumvirs decided that they had to strike now before things got any worse. On September the 3rd, 1797, that is 18 Fructidor, year 5, Paris woke up to find itself under military occupation. Soldiers occupied all the key strategic positions in Paris. The Parisians also discovered the streets plastered with anti-royalist propaganda. And in case you were wondering, this is the moment evidence of Pichagrou’s treason was publicly revealed.

[(33:37)](#!):

The Directory, and by that I mean the Triumvirate, issued arrest warrants for 53 council deputies and their two directorial colleagues, Carnot and Barthelemy. With the full support of the army, these arrests were carried out swiftly and efficiently. Then a carefully chosen quorum of loyal council delegates met under the protection of armed soldiers to officially sanction the deployment of troops in Paris and approve the subsequent arrests. Then this loyal republican quorum dropped the real bomb. They retroactively annulled the result of the spring elections in 49 departments, immediately purging 177 conservative members from the councils.

[(34:21)](#!):

The Fructidor coup, the coup from above, was carried out quickly and professionally. There was no pushback, there was no fighting in the streets. The nascent thrust to restore the monarchy was successfully parried.

[(34:39)](#!):

In the immediate aftermath of the Fructidor coup, Pichagrou and the other arrested delegates were tried, convicted of treason, and then exiled to French Guiana. Many of them managed to survive the subsequent ordeal though, including Pichagrou himself, who would eventually escape to the United States and from there to London, where he attached himself to the staff of a Russian general during the War of the Second Coalition. He then slipped back into France in 1803 to help organize a royalist coup against now first consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, but Pichagrou was betrayed and arrested in early 1804. Shortly thereafter, the guards discovered he had accidentally strangled himself to death.

[(35:23)](#!):

The great organizer of Victory Lazar Carnot, meanwhile, managed to escape from his cell and slip across the border into Switzerland. And it’s pretty clear that Carnot got a bum rap here. His only real crime was advocating generous peace terms for the Austrians. But this wasn’t because he was looking to bring back the monarchy. Carnot was a staunch Republican. It was simply that he had been the guy running the war for three years, knew intimately how destructive and destabilizing it had been. And when it was put to bed, he wanted it to stay in bed.

[(35:58)](#!):

He believed that the hard line advocated by the triumvirate would simply sow the seeds of the next war.

[(36:05)](#!):

Bonaparte himself seems to have recognized that Carnot had been swept up in something that he should really not have been swept up in. Carnot would be recalled from Switzerland in 1800 to briefly serve as minister of war and then in the legislative councils of the consulate. But then for the rest of Napoleon’s reign, Carnot would have an on-again, off-again relationship with the little corporal. Carnot finally retired from public life in protest when Napoleon crowned himself emperor, but then later came back to serve in the war of the Sixth Coalition and then the Hundred Days. He was exiled but not killed for being a regicide after the Restoration and died in Prussia in 1823.

[(36:47)](#!):

Now we’ll get into the broader impact of the Fructidor coup next week when we talk more about the directorial terror that is about to unfold. But just so you know, historians use Fructidor to divide the Directory from the Second Directory. The Directory was a constitutional government that lasted from August 1795 to September 1797. The Second Directory was a revolutionary government that simply did whatever it took to stay in power, engineering and annulling elections to suit its own purposes until it itself was taken down by the coup organized by Bonaparte and Talleyrand in November 1799.

[(37:31)](#!):

We’ll wrap up today with the treaty that finally does end the war of the First Coalition because after this treaty, there will be no more coalition.

[(37:41)](#!):

Now as I said, in the end, this final treaty wound up modeled entirely on the preliminaries at Leoben. It seems that both the British and the Austrians had been stringing out negotiations to see how the political situation in Paris unfolded. When that political situation unfolded into the coup of Fructidor, the British and Austrians had opposite reactions. The British broke off peace talks and decided to carry on with the war. The Austrians, meanwhile, signed basically the same deal they had agreed to at Leoben.

[(38:13)](#!):

Meeting at Campo Formio in October 1797, Bonaparte and an Austrian diplomat, whose name I won’t trouble you with, signed the Treaty of Campo Formio. In a mixture of nine public and eleven secret clauses, the French got all the territory west of the Rhine, the Austrians got Venice, and everyone recognized the independence of the new Italian republics. Also included in the treaty was the release of certain prominent prisoners of war, including, as I mentioned way back in episode 3.24, the Marquis de Lafayette.

[(38:49)](#!):

Frail but in good spirits after five years in captivity, Lafayette was let out of jail and reunited with his family. Hooray for Lafayette. With Austria out of the war, and the war on the continent now over, only the British stood against France.

[(39:08)](#!):

When the conflict had started in 1792, the British had done everything in their power to avoid getting involved. But now that they were involved, they were going to stay involved, allies or no allies. Next week, the directory, the second directory, will recall Bonaparte from Italy and order him to prepare an invasion of the British Isles. But as we will see, Bonaparte will survey the prospects for victory in the British Isles and say, yeah, this is not really a good idea. If you really want to hit the British, you’ll let me invade Egypt.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode three point forty seven, the directorial terror.

[(02:53)](#!):

We left off last time with the coup of Fructador, which created the second directory, and the Treaty of Campo Formio, which ended hostilities between France and Austria. Today we will cover the fallout from these two watershed events. The directory will spend the next six months trying to stabilize its regime at home, project its power abroad, and settle a new international order for Europe. Now I thought I was going to be talking more about Bonaparte today, the planned invasion of Great Britain, and then the real plan to invade Egypt, but I’ve rejiggered how I’m going to approach these final few episodes. So we’re going to talk about all that stuff next week as preparation for the episode two weeks from now, which will focus almost entirely on Bonaparte’s Egyptian expedition.

[(03:40)](#!):

In the immediate aftermath of the coup of 18 Fructador year five, that is September the 3rd, 1797, the purge directory and the purge legislative councils were faced with the question of whether or not to suspend the constitution of year three, or amend it, or rewrite it, or whatever, or just keep going, pretending like nothing had happened. And right after Fructador, for example, there were discussions between Talleyrand and Bonaparte and the Abecies about the benefits of drafting a new constitution with a much stronger central executive, but those talks went nowhere for the moment, and the purge directory decided it was safer to remain in the constitutional clothes they were wearing rather than trying to sew a new suit from scratch. Hopefully Fructador would be a one-off and we won’t have to resort to such naked tactics again, but of course the coup of Florial, which will annul the elections of year six, will be just around the corner, and Talleyrand, Bonaparte, and CS will go back to talking. Just talking about coming up with a better constitution.

[(04:46)](#!):

To replace Carnot and Barthelemy inside the directory, the Triumvirate elevated two staunch allies. These two men were Philippe-Antoine Merlot de Douy and Francois de Neufchateau. The latter is a non-entity who will get his name chosen to retire the following May, so don’t worry about him, no one else certainly did, but Merlot has been a delegate in both the National Assembly and the National Convention and was a regicide. He has been serving as the directory’s minister of justice, and that’s what he was doing when he was promoted to the directory, and he had spent most of his time focused on threats from the right and keeping tabs on suspicious emigres. So the newly reconstituted directory then set out to complete its repression of conservatism, implementing what is now known as the directorial terror.

[(05:40)](#!):

But since everyone had lived through the terror, the directorial terror was far more about political repression and intimidating critics into silence rather than, like, slaughtering their way to victory. In the first week of September 1797, that is, in the days right after Fructidor, the directory abolished freedom of the press. From now on, all publications would be registered, catalogued, and monitored. Print anything the directory didn’t like, and they would just shut you down. It goes without saying that the first targets of this revocation of press freedom was aimed at anyone saying anything even remotely right-wing. They also passed an emergency law that allowed the directory to dismiss and replace judicial, municipal, and administrative officials at all levels of government. Conservatives were identified and purged and replaced by solid Republicans. But you know what that means. That’s right. That’s how the left is going to start creeping back to life because that’s where all the committed Republicans live. And so next week, the directory will have to spin back around to put down the left again because that’s what the directory is all about, spinning around in these tight little circles trying to balance on the head of a pin. It is no wonder when Talleyrand showed up he said this is never going to last.

[(06:59)](#!):

There were two big targets of the directory’s wrath, though. Emigres and priests. To take the emigres first, remember, there were a bunch of emigres who returned to France after Termidor, and they had been looking to vote the monarchy back into power. Well, it is time for all of them to clear back out of France. The directory announced that if your name was still on the prescribed list, you had two weeks to vacate the country on pain of death.

[(07:29)](#!):

But to enforce this decree, the directory did not turn to revolutionary tribunals and show trials and summary execution. Many of those caught lingering over the next few months and years were processed through ordinary criminal courts, or in the case of specific emigres, a special military commission handling cases of treason. And through the spring of 1799, that military commission will have executed just 160 men, and that was after they had all been given fair warning to clear out. So given what we’ve seen so far in the show, the directorial terror hardly lives up to its name. But there was one interesting extension to the re-prescription of the emigres that is worth mentioning. In November, the directory decreed that all nobles, because they were nobles, were now considered aliens, and if they wanted to stay in France, they needed to apply to become a naturalized citizen just like any foreign immigrant. This went further than any previous revolutionary government had ever gone, even the Saint-Culot-backed Committee of Public Safety. But this decree turned out to be all bark and no bite. Paul Barra was a noble. Bonaparte was a noble. Are you really going to make them apply for citizenship?

[(08:48)](#!):

This most extreme of all the anti-noble laws was never really enforced.

[(08:55)](#!):

The biggest target of the directorial terror, though, was by far the clergy, again with the clergy. The triumvirate of Rubel, La Raveliere, and Barra were all personally anti-clerical, especially La Raveliere. They had hoped to keep the religious question out of the political mix, but then the newly conservative legislative councils had tried to rehabilitate all those refractory priests, and so after Fructidor, the second directory turned in the opposite direction, demanding the clergy take a new civic oath swearing a hatred of monarchy. The punishment for refusal was deportation to French Guiana.

[(09:37)](#!):

But if you look at it, this new oath was not as demanding as the original civic oaths handed down in the early days of the revolution, which demanded that the priests swear loyalty to the French nation above all, including the Pope, which is why it was so controversial. But all this new civic oath says is, say you hate monarchy. This is a far less extreme and purely political demand. Just say you hate monarchy. Come on, say it. But tons of the priests wouldn’t, especially as we’ll see in a moment in the newly annexed territories of Belgium.

[(10:13)](#!):

But again, this law was more about intimidating the priests into silence rather than aggressively pursuing a door-to-door search for refractory priests. By the end of the directory, about 12,000 priests will have been denounced. Of those, only about 10% will actually be arrested, and of those, only about 10% would be processed for deportation. And of those, only a handful would actually wind up being deported. So really, this new oath was about making the priests be quiet. The directory only went after a priest if they started causing too much trouble.

[(10:53)](#!):

So while the second directory worked to shore itself up politically, it was also working to shore itself up financially. And to talk about that, I must first begin by correcting a boneheaded mistake I made last week. When I was talking about the ministerial reshuffle, the triumvirate carried out in July 1797, the one that brought Talleyrand back into power, I said that they appointed a new finance minister to help increase revenue and balance the books. Well, that was totally and completely wrong. The finance minister in question was Dominique Vosson-Ramel, and he was actually appointed way back in February 1796. He’s been around from almost the beginning of the directory and will hang around until almost the very end. He will finally resign in July 1799. He was in no way a part of the reshuffle. I just completely biffed that.

[(11:46)](#!):

But that said, Ramel was having a heck of a time getting some of the men who worked for him to do their jobs, and he was under sustained attack from the conservatives in the legislative councils who were trying to get him fired for his various financial expedients we’re going to talk about here in a moment. After Fructidor gave the all-clear-to-purge suspected royalists, his job got a lot easier, and he subsequently took the opportunity to do something dramatic, very dramatic, to solve the directory’s financial troubles.

[(12:20)](#!):

So since the hyperinflationary collapse at the Asenyaum and the total failure of the territorial mandate, the directory abandoned paper currency and went back to relying only on hard specie, minted coins.

[(12:34)](#!):

But since all of these had been driven out of circulation years ago, Ramel and everyone else in France suddenly faced the exact opposite problem. Rather than runaway inflation, they were dealing with runaway deflation. Prices that had been bursting through the ceiling now collapsed through the floor as no one had any money to pay for anything. In many areas barter alone became the only means of exchange. This was especially bad for anyone who had debts to pay, because the numbers written down in the days of hyperinflation were now orders of magnitude beyond what you could hope to cobble together from selling your crops or your wares or your services or whatever it is you did for a living. And good luck trying to borrow any more money. Interest rates skyrocketed well past usury into double secret usury. And that was a problem not just for the farmer in the field or the local shopkeeper, it was a problem for the treasury of France. Ramel was forced to borrow to cover the state’s debts, I mean what else could he do, but to do so he was taking on interest rates that were downright scandalous. And that was one of the things he was being attacked for throughout 1797. It looked a lot like he was in cahoots with mustache twirling financiers to rob the government blind. But Ramel was really not in cahoots with the financiers, or if he was he is about to double cross them so so hard. So hard that I think he is just a guy trying to pay the government’s bills rather than a guy trying to line his own pockets. Though he probably was lining his pockets a little bit, they all were, that’s what the directory was all about. As the year progressed, Ramel kept scrambling to keep things together. The directory confiscated church property in Belgium and sold it off to raise money, and the treaty with the Batavian Republic required cash payments and forced loans. And then Italy was paying off like a slot machine. But it wasn’t enough, and it was never going to be enough. So after Fructidor cleared out all of his fiercest critics, Ramel dropped a bomb on September the 30th, 1797. The state was going to repudiate two-thirds of its debt. So like I say, if he was in cahoots with the financiers, he just shivved them in the back so hard.

[(14:56)](#!):

Now the actual process of repudiation was to issue one-time only paper bonds that would be redeemable for national lands. Basically what the Asenya were originally before they became a currency. Now the total value of these bonds did not add up to the total amount owed by the state, but tough luck, this is what you’re going to get. The value of these bonds would then proceed to drop to 60% face value, and within a year, the government will announce it’s just not going to accept them anymore. So that’s one way to get out of debt.

[(15:31)](#!):

But this declared bankruptcy was a shocking scandal. For the whole course of the revolution, none of the governments had ever repudiated the national debt, not even the National Assembly, who could have made a pretty legitimate case for repudiating the debts of the ASEAN regime. Sure, they had wound up paying off the king’s debts in piles of paper that later turned out to be worthless, but just saying, we’re done with this? It’s never happened.

[(15:58)](#!):

But skipping out on the debt only affected one side of the balance sheet. So Rommel had to figure out a way to also increase state revenue. For a variety of reasons, tax receipts had plummeted over the years. So in mid-November 1797, he rolled out a new agency to enforce and collect taxes. This agency would be centrally operated, and its commissioners would work directly for the Finance Ministry, which was another major break with revolutionary precedent. Even at the height of the Committee of Public Safety and their all-powerful representatives on mission, local tax collection had always been handled by local officials. The king’s unscrupulous tax farmers had been one of the most hated parts of the ASEAN regime, so tax collection had always been left to the locals. Rommel’s new revenue service is taking France all the way back to 1788. And what’s more, many of the guys hired to be the Directory’s tax collectors came from the ranks of those old ASEAN regime tax farmers.

[(17:05)](#!):

But it wasn’t just the tax men themselves that reminded French citizens of the old ways, because Rommel also decided to revive all the hated excise taxes that had been right at the heart of why everyone wanted to call the Estates General in the first place. But excise taxes were a lucrative source of income, which is why the royal ministries had kept going back to them even though they were so unpopular.

[(17:28)](#!):

So at the dawn of year six, everyone had to deal with a host of very familiar taxes on things like tobacco and doors and windows. There were now road tolls again. Stamp tax was levied on all newspapers and legal forms. It would not be as haphazardly applied as these taxes had been before the Revolution, but still, this is verbatim stuff that we talked about way, way back in episode 3.2, the broken regime. Rommel even flirted with the idea of a universal salt tax, but if you’ll recall from that same episode, the Gabel was one of the most hated of all the indirect taxes, and bringing it back was just one thing too many. So Rommel let it drop.

[(18:13)](#!):

Now, since the second Directory is essentially now operating as a partnership between the government and the army, tax enforcement was guaranteed by the soldiers. Governments or municipalities or even individual homes that resisted the new taxes were liable to find soldiers camping out in the town square. In the end, Rommel’s financial reforms really did help stabilize the national finances, but as you can imagine, they won the Directory no friends. So this is a great place to pivot from the Directory’s domestic policy of political repression and economic expedience to the Directory’s foreign policy of political repression and economic expedience.

[(18:55)](#!):

Because one other huge pillar of the government’s improved finances was their naked looting of all the territories they had won during the war. So we’ll spend the rest of today running a circuit of the Directory’s little empire to see how things are shaping up for the people who have been liberated by revolutionary France. So we should start with the main territory that has been fully annexed into France, the former Austrian Netherlands, or what we’ve all agreed it’s cool for me to call Belgium.

[(19:28)](#!):

After the second conquest of Belgium by Piscogru in the fall of 1794, the local citizens were briefly treated as an occupied foreign country, and Lazare Carnot, for example, was a major proponent of looting the country to help subsidize the war. He went so far as to create the ominously named Agency of Trade and Extraction to cart off all the moveable wealth. But a majority inside the national convention, this is all still in the national convention days, planned to incorporate Belgium into France, and they decided that such harsh requisitioning would be counterproductive, so in early 1795 the agency was shut down.

[(20:08)](#!):

Farmers then went in to pave the way for formal annexation, and in October 1795, in one of their last acts before handing the reigns over to the Directory, the national convention annexed Belgium, and all those former Belgian subjects of the Habsburgs became French citizens. Now Austria of course did not recognize this annexation, yet, but there was very little they could do about it, and besides, if you’ll recall from our previous discussions of Austrian foreign policy, they had been trying to give away their territories in the Netherlands for like 80 years now. It was not a province they really mourned the loss of.

[(20:46)](#!):

But relations between Belgium and the Directory were going to be strained. Very strained. Yes, they were now fellow citizens, rather than conquered enemies, but on the ground the difference was very hard to make out. The trouble began most especially over religion, because of course it did. Initially, the Belgians were pretty happy to hear that one of the main pillars of the Termidorian Reaction was freedom of worship. But unfortunately, that ideal was no match for the economic possibilities offered by all the lands owned by the local Belgian church, especially since the Directory was still trying to prop up the Asignon and then the territorial mandates.

[(21:28)](#!):

The Directory started unilaterally seizing church property and putting it up for auction. In September 1796, they abolished all monastic orders, seized their property, and put it all up for auction. This was all done in the name of harmonizing the laws of Belgium with the rest of France, where monastic orders had been abolished for years, but it did very little to harmonize the people with the rest of France.

[(21:55)](#!):

The Belgians attempted to voice their displeasure in the elections of year 5, and they elected a slate of conservative delegates to the legislative councils. But in this very first act of political expression as French citizens, they learned a harsh lesson. The Belgian elections were among those annulled in the coup of Fructidor, and all their delegates were purged from the legislative councils. Not exactly the welcome to your new home they had been looking for.

[(22:23)](#!):

After Fructidor, things started to get really ugly, because the Belgian clergy uniformly refused to swear the hatred of monarchy oath now required by the Directory. Of the 12,000 priests identified as refractory, 10,000 were Belgians.

[(22:40)](#!):

So in Belgium, the Directory is having a hard time learning the lessons from the Vend\xc3\xa9e. They responded to Belgian intransigence with a crackdown on priests who refused to take the oath. So the whole region was now on edge. And wouldn’t you know it, pretty soon the Directory will drop literally the same match onto the flammable material in Belgium that the Convention had dropped into the Vend\xc3\xa9e. We haven’t gotten there yet, but in September 1798 the Directory will make the Belgians subject to conscription. And that, my friends, will provoke a full-blown rebellion. And also, like had happened in the Vend\xc3\xa9e, the region was under garrison by the French army, and so the rebellion would get out of hand very quickly.

[(23:25)](#!):

But that is still in the future, and so we should move on up to the Batavian Republic, which is where the French had stationed its regional garrison. A garrison that was at the moment pretty dang shrunk down to size. After the Batavian Republic was proclaimed in January 1795, and then confirmed in June 1795, relations between France and her very first Sister Republic, because that’s what these republics get called, was, surprise surprise, strained. But that was partly because relations between the Dutch themselves were strained.

[(24:03)](#!):

When delegates met to hammer out a new constitution for the Batavian Republic, there was quickly a divide between Federalists, who wanted to keep the old, decentralized system of government, and those who wanted a unified, centralized state like France was becoming.

[(24:19)](#!):

But with the support of the occupying French army, the convention delegates ultimately produced a mostly centralized constitution that was vague enough on the details that it would hopefully please everyone. Instead, it pleased no one, and when the French ambassador endorsed it, that turned out to be the kiss of death, and so when the constitution was submitted to the voters in May 1797, it was rejected, 108,000 to just 27,000. Now the reason the French endorsement turned out to be a kiss of death was because the French had become extraordinarily unpopular by May 1797.

[(25:00)](#!):

As we discussed back in episode 3.40 of Frozen Rivers, when the French showed up in the Netherlands, there was a genuine outpouring of enthusiasm from the Dutch people, and the French soldiers were in fact greeted as liberators. But the reality of French occupation brought everyone down hard and fast. From the beginning, the French paid for all their requisitions in worthless paper, so basically just legalized theft. Then the Treaty of the Hague that was signed in June 1795 called for the Dutch to pay for and provision a 25,000 man French occupying army. This was obviously quite a burden, but it also turned out to be quite an insult, because in short order there were only 10,000 French garrisoning the country. The rest were peeled off to go fight the Austrians, but the Dutch were still paying as if there were 25,000.

[(25:56)](#!):

These insulting financial burdens might have been bearable had the French occupation not crippled the Dutch economy. Obviously overseas trade is the main lifeblood of the Dutch economy, but now that trade was under constant attack by the British Navy. Goods that had been staples of Dutch life for 200 years suddenly disappeared from the shelves. And as for Dutch manufacturing, it now had no place to export its goods. France was clearly the logical market. But though they were sister republics, France had erected massive tariff barriers to protect French manufacturing, which left the Dutch with no place to go.

[(26:37)](#!):

All these trade disruptions then collapsed the shipbuilding industry, which was yet another mainstay of the economy. Tons of people were thrown out of work. So yes, the French pretty well went from angelic liberators to demonic occupiers overnight.

[(26:54)](#!):

After the first constitution was rejected in May 1797, a second convention had to be called, but this one gridlocked too. But after the French Directory staged the coup of Fructidor, they decided it was safe to take a more active part in internal Dutch politics. And they were in no mood to accommodate their sister republic, especially after the Dutch’s terrible showing at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797. The acquisition of the Dutch fleet was supposed to be a major boon to France’s war effort against the British. But when the Dutch and British fleets met for the first time in the North Sea off the coast of Holland, the Dutch were utterly routed. They lost all 11 ships of the line they had sent into battle. The British lost none.

[(27:43)](#!):

So in January 1798, the French ordered local Dutch forces to purge the still deadlocked constitutional convention of its conservative Federalist faction. The remaining delegates then produced a unitary state government modeled on the Directory, sweeping aside all the vestiges of the old regime, including the powerful guilds and the fiercely independent oligarchic city councils. The purged constitutional convention then also did this thing, where they declared themselves to be the sitting legislative councils, and said that in the next election, only one-third of us will be up for re-election, and this was no more popular with the Dutch than it had been with the French when the national convention passed the law of two-thirds.

[(28:28)](#!):

The new constitution also disestablished the Dutch church, which crippled whatever social safety net existed in the Netherlands just as the economy was starting to collapse. But unfortunately for the Dutch, they were now stuck between a rock and a hard place. The expelled Prince of Orange, William V, was up in London writing missives even more reactionary and inflammatory than Louis XVIII was writing, so inviting him to come back in was just out of the question. But the Dutch wound up in a not totally terrible place, at least politically.

[(29:05)](#!):

When the Directory staged the coup of Florial in the spring of 1798, a coup we will talk about next week and which targeted the left, the Directory decided neutralizing radicals was now more important than neutralizing conservatives. So with French approval, a Dutch general carried out a coup against the self-proclaimed Dutch legislative councils, reinstating the formerly purged federalists, calling for free and open elections, and getting them.

[(29:33)](#!):

This helped clamp down on any nascent rebellion against French rule, and it offered the Batavian Republic a degree of home rule, not at all afforded to the other sister republics being created by the French down in Italy and in Switzerland.

[(29:50)](#!):

Down in Italy, Bonaparte hung around after the Treaty of Campo Formio to oversee the transition to peace, but he would soon be coming back to Paris, and as soon as he left, things started to get a little dicey as the Italians started to divide between a majority who were not at all keen with the French occupation and a minority of radicals who wanted the French to help them sweep aside all the old regimes and unify the peninsula under a single national government. But the French wanted no part of that dream. They wanted a divided Italy that would be compliant and profitable, not a unified Italy that would pose a major threat.

[(30:31)](#!):

So the next great reorganization on the Italian peninsula hit in December 1797, when a riot targeting the French embassy broke out in Rome, or possibly a riot that was instigated by Italian radicals who wanted to provoke the French into erasing the Papal States from the map, because that’s what’s about to happen.

[(30:52)](#!):

During the riot, a French general was killed, and the French ambassador, who just so happened to be Napoleon’s brother Joseph Bonaparte, had to flee to Florence. Since the Directory had just turned in a decisively anti-clerical direction, they were not just going to sit by and let the capital of Catholicism kill one of their generals and get away with it. So in February 1798, the French army marched south, entered Rome, and occupied the Eternal City. When they arrived, a group of Italians stood in the Forum and proclaimed the new Roman Republic. But it is critical to note that those guys were not themselves Romans. They all came from the north. The Romans themselves wanted no part of any of this, especially after the Pope was taken prisoner and escorted out of the city.

[(31:45)](#!):

Knowing that the Romans were not going to be capable of even pretend self-government, the Directory dispatched a team of French lawyers to go down and draw up a new constitution, and these guys had a ball, recreating all the institutions of the ancient Roman Republic. There were consuls and senators and tribunes. For a bunch of guys who grew up steeped in classical history, this all must have been a great delight. But it was all for show. All the officials who were appointed by the French, and anything those officials wanted to do, had to be approved by the French army. The local French representatives also had the power to issue their own decrees as they saw fit. The now thoroughly anti-clerical French occupiers then did what they were doing everywhere. They disestablished the church and targeted church property for confiscation.

[(32:38)](#!):

But Rome is the church. The church is Rome. So going after church property meant going after, like, all property. And shutting down church functions meant shutting down the economy of the city. For the next ten months, the French looted the city at will while the Romans slid into destitution. The Roman Republic was not popular, and pretty soon the French would find themselves kicked out during the lead up to the War of the Second Coalition. Meanwhile further north, the supposedly compliant Cisalpine Republic that had been created by Bonaparte was starting to exert some independence.

[(33:18)](#!):

But the problem here was not that the leaders of the new republic were too conservative, but rather that they were too radical. Milan had become the capital of choice for enlightened, nationalistic Italians from all over the peninsula. And they were going to use the Cisalpine Republic as a base to integrate all of Italy into a single state, a state that they did not want to be merely a stooge for the French.

[(33:44)](#!):

So when in February 1798 the French delivered a treaty for them to sign that required Milan to fund a 25,000-man French occupying army and raise a 22,000-man Italian auxiliary army, they balked and refused to sign. So the French did what was now becoming second nature. They purged the Cisalpine government of men who resisted French demands and appointed new men who agreed to play ball. These men signed the treaty. There, see, isn’t liberty and independence wonderful?

[(34:19)](#!):

Meanwhile, even further north, the Swiss were watching all of this with mounting dread. Their long-cherished neutrality and independence were clearly threatened now that France was turning Italy into a French satellite.

[(34:33)](#!):

So just to give a quick little bit of background, at the end of the 18th century, the Swiss Confederation was one of the most intricately convoluted political units in Europe, a microscopic hodgepodge of independent cantons and municipalities and free cities who were only linked by the loosest of mutual understandings. And on top of that, there were three main language groups, French, German, and Italian. Most of the native Swiss wanted no part of revolutionary France and wanted to keep things like they had always been. But a few native Swiss were afraid of becoming Cisalpine-ized, that’s what they called it. These guys believed that it would be far better to integrate into a single state and then make a treaty with France now before the French imposed harsh terms by force.

[(35:25)](#!):

A few of these forward-thinkers were invited to Paris in December 1797 to discuss the formation of a unitary Swiss state. Now there was some French-speaking Swiss territory that the Directory was going to annex outright, but they agreed to let the rest of Switzerland govern itself, and the Swiss collaborators returned home to get ready.

[(35:46)](#!):

The plan was for the French to annex the city of Mulhouse in January, and that would be the signal for a pro-French, pro-unitary Swiss uprising to get going, but that is not how things went. The annexation of Mulhouse triggered not a coordinated uprising, but total chaos, as everyone in Switzerland seemed to take the opportunity to make self-interested plays at everyone else’s expense. Several areas that had been dominated by cities tried to shrug off urban rule, neighboring cantons grabbed at each other’s territory, old tensions between the French-Swiss and the German-Swiss and the Italian-Swiss flared back up.

[(36:25)](#!):

It was quite a mess.

[(36:28)](#!):

So in February, the Directory did what the collaborators had been trying to forestall. They sent in a French army to restore order. The Directory ordered the French general in charge to set up three republics, corresponding to the language divisions, but quickly changed their minds when they decided that that would be too difficult to control. So at the end of March 1798, the French declared the former Swiss Confederation to be the single unified Helvetic Republic, and they imposed a constitution creating, as was now the standard model, a bicameral legislature with a five-man executive directory. They then divided up the new republic into 23 equal cantons, but conspicuously absent from the new map of the Helvetic Republic was Geneva, which was simply annexed into France. Representatives from the cantons were then ordered to meet for an inaugural legislative session, but nearly half refused to send anyone. The French army had to march around compelling men to come by force. After that, the Helvetic Republic was well and truly Cisalpine-ized. The Helvetic government was forced to sign a treaty granting the French free and exclusive use of the Alpine passes, and then they demanded the Swiss, particularly the Swiss banking operations, provide funds that would go to both support the Army of Italy and Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt, which was due to launch in May 1798.

[(37:58)](#!):

So come the spring of 1798, the old maps of Europe were thoroughly obsolete, and France was enjoying the lucrative profits that came with having so many allied sister republics who were so happy to be providing their French benefactors with so much wealth. I mean, seriously, what a lovely generosity of spirit in this new age of liberty and fellowship. Next week, we will open with a discussion of the other side of the Directory’s foreign policy. So, not how they were dictating terms to their friends, but how they’d plan to defeat their few remaining enemies.

[(38:36)](#!):

But wait, you say, there’s only one enemy left, right? The British. Well, yes, technically that’s true. But new Foreign Minister Talleyrand is going to accidentally provoke the Americans into an undeclared naval war in the Caribbean, because the Puritanical Colonials refused to pay a very civilized bribe that Talleyrand demanded before they sat down to discuss Franco-American relations. Then, we will move on to talk about the elections of Year 6, elections that will bring yet another abrupt change in who the Directory fears most. Where the elections of Year 5 triggered the annulment of the results in a purge of conservatives, the elections of Year 6 will trigger an annulment of the results in a purge of the re-re-re-resurgent left.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.48, The Coup of Florial.

[(01:37)](#!):

So we left off last time with a circuit of all of France’s new allies, all those sister republics who were thrilled, just thrilled, to be joining the French revolutionary project of liberating mankind, and by that I of course mean getting wrong dry. Today we’ll take a look at France’s posture towards its remaining enemies, the British of course, who were supposed to be the only ones left, but then also the Americans, who Talleyrand is about to accidentally provoke into an undeclared naval war. And once we’re done listening to the stream of bald-faced lies coming out of Talleyrand denying he had anything to do with driving the Americans to take up arms, we’ll return to the domestic front for the elections of year 6, suppress the left, and then wrap up today by getting Bonaparte launched on his ultimately ill-fated Egyptian expedition. All of this taken together is going to set the stage for the formation of a second anti-French coalition by the end of 1798, and the resumption of full-blown war in 1799.

[(02:40)](#!):

So to back up a little bit, the Treaty of Campo Formio that had been signed by Bonaparte and the Austrian ambassadors in October 1797 had settled things between France and Austria. But the Austrian Habsburgs were just one component of the insanely complicated political coalition called the Holy Roman Empire. They were the most powerful part to be sure, but still, just a part. So shortly after Campo Formio, a huge summit of all the little sovereign components of the Holy Roman Empire met at the city of Rastatt along the Rhine to discuss and ratify the terms that had been worked out. Most controversial of all those were of course the ceding of all the German principalities on the west side of the Rhine. And the French delegation, soon led by a guy named Jean-Baptiste Traor, were not making it easy for the Germans to accept these losses.

[(03:35)](#!):

Bonaparte had agreed in principle at Campo Formio that new territorial acquisitions made by the French at the expense of the Holy Roman Empire would be matched by compensatory lands elsewhere, hence the handover of Venice that we talked about last week. But at Rastatt, the Austrian delegation now asserted that ceding the left bank of the Rhine counted as a new territorial acquisition for France that required compensation. Traor said, fat chance, the left bank has been under French occupation for so long that it’s hardly a new acquisition.

[(04:09)](#!):

This was just the first of many squabbles that led the Congress nowhere fast. And in the end, the Congress of Rastatt would wind up never actually coming to any formal agreement as a series of diplomatic and military incidents eventually led to the outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition in 1799 before the peace terms ending the War of the First Coalition were actually ratified.

[(04:33)](#!):

But for the Directory, the situation in Italy and along the Rhine was certainly settled enough that they were able to order Bonaparte to return to Paris to help them deliver the death blow to the one enemy left actively in the field, the British. This death blow was to be nothing less than a full-blown invasion of Great Britain.

[(04:56)](#!):

Now talk of a multiple front invasion of the British Isles had not been killed by the failure of the Irish expedition in 1796. And indeed, when the Directory really started to discuss plans, Lazare Hoche was the most likely candidate to lead the invasion. Almost all the troops massing along the English Channel had served under him before. And Hoche himself was eager to redeem himself for the failed Irish expedition, which he not unjustly blamed on the weather. But in September 1797, Hoche suddenly up and died in his base along the Rhine River. He was just 29 years old. And that left Bonaparte as the only logical choice to lead the invasion.

[(05:38)](#!):

Bonaparte’s return to Paris was a nerve-wracking experience for the men running the Directory. On the one hand, here he was, the conquering hero, the man whose victories had helped legitimize their rule and whose pledge of support, before and after the coup of Fructidor, were key to the coup’s success. On the other hand, here he was, the conquering hero, who is way more popular both inside the army and amongst the French citizenry than we could ever hope to be.

[(06:08)](#!):

But Bonaparte was a careful planner, and he had no desire to seize power…yet. So while in the capital, he was conspicuously deferential to civilian authority, and made no outward displays of his military might. He dressed as a regular citizen, rather than marching around in a full dress uniform, making everyone nervous. And when the Directory ordered him to go take over the planned invasion of Britain, he said, sure thing, you’re the boss.

[(06:35)](#!):

But he also spent a lot of time making political contacts, finally meeting in person for example Talleyrand and also the Ebay CS, the man who had scorned a directorship because he had his own constitutional plans for France. So the seeds of Brumaire were being sown over the winter of 1797-1798. What was not being sown over that winter was an invasion of Great Britain.

[(07:02)](#!):

Now Bonaparte does not seem to have arrived and the army camped along the Channel Coast intending to abort the invasion, but it did not take him long to decide that it really needed to be aborted. This was no small thing the Directory was asking him to do, and with the Dutch Navy having just been ravaged at Camperdown, the invasion fleet assembled was simply insufficient for the job. To say nothing of the men themselves, who were not the crack troops forged in the battles of Italy, but rather men from the Vend\xc3\xa9e and the Pyrenees who had not seen major action and no major battles for years. Bonaparte came back to Paris and said look I’ll do this, but the earliest, and I mean the earliest that I will be ready to go is the end of 1798. And even then, the success of this is not guaranteed. And that is actually one of Bonaparte’s biggest concerns. At that moment, he was invincible. He had won the war against Austria without losing a single battle, at least according to his official dispatches. Why risk his well-won reputation on a dubious mission to England that might wreck his career with a colossal failure?

[(08:15)](#!):

But he had an alternative suggestion. In the period between the preliminaries at Leoben and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Bonaparte had been twiddling his thumbs in Italy and started thinking globally, specifically that the best way to take out the British was not to try to go and occupy London, but rather to try to go and occupy Egypt and limit British access to their wealthy colonial holdings in India. After Venice was forced to cede their Mediterranean islands to the French at Campo Formio, these dreams of an Egyptian campaign became a very real possibility.

[(08:52)](#!):

So after Bonaparte returned from his dismal survey of the army on the Channel Coast, he told Talleyrand that what they should really do is invade Egypt. Not only would conquest be easier, but it would promise a lot of plunder and permanent colonial wealth and this sharp check on British power.

[(09:10)](#!):

Talleyrand thought all of this an absolutely capital idea, since he too had major reservations about the invasion of England. So Bonaparte and Talleyrand took the plan to the Directory in March 1798, and the Directory said, okay, go do it. For them, the calculation was pretty simple. If Bonaparte pulls it off, all the good things he just said would happen, would happen. And if he fails, well, that’s one less Napoleon Bonaparte we have to worry about coming back and overthrowing our little regime.

[(09:43)](#!):

While Talleyrand was helping Bonaparte arrange the Egyptian campaign, he was also in the process of introducing a new belligerent into the war, a belligerent that had basically gone to superhuman lengths to stay out of the fighting, but who could resist no longer. The United States of America. Relations between the United States and both sides of the War of the First Coalition had not been great during the presidency of George Washington. By insisting on American neutrality, Washington irritated everyone, and both the British and French navies harassed neutral American shipping to prevent them from assisting the other side.

[(10:25)](#!):

In 1797, though, Washington finally accepted the efficacy of the somewhat humiliating Jay Treaty, which agreed to nearly every concession, condition, and constraint the British demanded of the Americans in exchange for their navy leaving American shipping alone. The French were livid at this perceived betrayal. But despite rising tensions out on the high seas, when Washington retired in March 1797, the United States was still neutral.

[(10:56)](#!):

Incoming President John Adams then proceeded to go to pretty crazy lengths to try to maintain American neutrality. But with Washington out of the picture, a hyper-polarized partisan battle erupted between the pro-British Federalists and the pro-French Jeffersonians. But no one did more to blow up the dream of American neutrality than French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. Talleyrand had of course just spent two years living in the United States. He knew the lay of the political land, and he knew that Adams was not particularly well-disposed towards the French.

[(11:32)](#!):

This was confirmed in Talleyrand’s eyes when Adams dispatched Charles Coatsworth Pinckney as the new ambassador to France. Pinckney was a staunch Federalist and avowedly anti-French. So at Talleyrand’s recommendation, the Directory refused Pinckney’s credentials. Not wanting to capitulate, but also not wanting to start a war, Adams then dispatched future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall and New England merchant and well-resonated patriot leader Elbridge Gerry to join Pinckney in a three-man diplomatic commission to work through the impasse.

[(12:09)](#!):

But when this commission presented themselves to Talleyrand in October 1797, he refused to recognize their credentials unless they agreed to a. loan the French a bunch of money, and b. pay Talleyrand a huge bribe equivalent to \xc2\xa350,000. Bribes in exchange for consideration was a routine part of European diplomacy, but Talleyrand took it to a high art. There was simply nothing to be done unless you pay me a great deal of money.

[(12:42)](#!):

The Americans, however, were offended by this old-world corruption, and Pinckney famously said, no, no, no, not a sixpence. So Talleyrand rejected their credentials, and negotiations had to proceed through unofficial channels. Those unofficial channels turned out to be a trio of Talleyrand’s agents who would come around and say, look, just pay the money and you’re in. What is so hard about this?

[(13:07)](#!):

These agents were later identified in redacted communiques as agents X and Y and Z, which is why this whole thing is about to be called the XYZ affair. The incensed Americans refused all further informal talks, and demanded to either be credentialed or diplomatic ties would be severed. Talleyrand managed to convince Elbridge Gerry, the least anti-French of the three commissioners, to maintain super-secret back channels to stave off war. But he said he could no longer deal with Pinckney, which was fine by Pinckney. In April 1798, Pinckney and Marshall sailed home.

[(13:47)](#!):

In the meantime, their dispatches back to Washington, D.C. had been creating a full-blown scandal. Members of Congress knew that the talks were going nowhere, and that this was likely due to French perfidy. First congressmen started calling for war. The Jeffersonian congressmen, of course, wanted to avoid this at all costs, which led them to make a huge tactical blunder. You see, President Adams had been keeping most of the details from the dispatches secret. The Jeffersonians believed that Adams was doing this because he wanted war, and was trying to make the French look as bad as possible. But they had it backwards. Adams knew full well that if Congress knew the truth about Talleyrand’s insulting refusal to credential the ambassadors and his demands for a naked bribe, that war would be unavoidable.

[(14:39)](#!):

So after relentless Jeffersonian pressure to unseal the dispatches, Adams finally relented in March 1798. Instead of exposing the president as an anti-French warmonger, it turned out the French had been behaving even worse than the wildest rumors had it, and that President Adams had been trying to keep it under wraps.

[(14:60)](#!):

With the XYZ affair now out in the open, Congress pushed for an aggressive stance towards France. They ordered the Navy to expand, and then in July 1798, they voted to annul the Treaty of Alliance that had been in place since 1778. They then authorized the American Navy to attack French vessels. But President Adams, still fighting for neutrality, however technical the distinction might be, refused to sign an actual declaration of war. So what followed was a two-year-long conflict known in the United States as the Quasi-War, a war exclusively fought at sea and almost entirely in the Caribbean. In the grand scheme of things, the Quasi-War between France and the United States was a low-level fight in a secondary theater of the larger war, and the British and American navies never coordinated or joined forces. But still, provoking the Americans into attacking French ships on the high seas did not serve French interests at all.

[(15:59)](#!):

Of course, when Talleyrand was brought in by the Directory to account for himself, he then lied his head off, said he had nothing to do with it, said that he didn’t know who XYZ were, and he even went so far as to start up a fake investigation to uncover these rogue agents who were mucking with the Directory’s foreign policy. So the XYZ affair is not exactly Talleyrand’s finest hour.

[(16:26)](#!):

While the Americans were getting ready to jump into the Quasi-War in the spring of 1798, the Directory was mostly concerned not with foreign affairs, but with domestic affairs. Specifically, the looming possibility that Jacobin leftists were about to get themselves voted into a majority of the legislative councils and try to drag France back to the dark days of year two and the Terror. Not the Directorial Terror, but the Terror Terror.

[(16:54)](#!):

So while the triumvirate running the Directory had hoped Fructidor would be a one-off emergency coup, they decided they could not risk it. And so the anti-right coup of 18 Fructidor gets a historical twin. The anti-left-wing coup of 22 Florial.

[(17:14)](#!):

Now the left wing we are talking about now is not really the radical leftists of the old days. The few true radicals remaining had been taken down with Bebeuf and the conspiracy of equals. And in case you’re wondering, yes, I did totally forget to follow up on Bebeuf after the failed Grinnell Uprising of September 1796, but that was because there’s not much else to tell. Bebeuf sat around in prison until May 1797 when he and one of his closest associates were finally sentenced to death and guillotined on May the 27th. That was the end of everyone’s favorite proto-communist.

[(17:51)](#!):

The former Jacobins now putting themselves forward for election were of a perfectly moderate variety. They were dangerous to the Directory not because they wanted to overthrow the government, but because they might turn out to be self-confident enough to believe that they could act as a opposition party. They supported a platform that included enlarging the franchise to make the Constitution more democratic, and maybe doing something about all those greedy speculators who seemed to have flourished in the years since Termidor. These were fairly banal reforms, and had the triumvirate inside the Directory been a bit more self-confident themselves, the elections of year six could have marked the beginning of a contentious but ultimately stable republic, with two parties vying for power and the loser settling into being the loyal opposition upon defeat. But the triumvirate didn’t want that. They wanted legislative councils who would be compliant and docile, a mere rubber stamp for their wishes. So this burgeoning opposition party had to be killed before it could grow any bigger.

[(18:57)](#!):

But of course the regime was itself responsible for the growing confidence of the left, as they had targeted conservatives and royalists in the lead-up to and the aftermath of the coup of Fructidor. The Directory found it useful to encourage the activities of committed republicans, as long as they attacked conservatives and royalists. Their papers were not touched after freedom of the press was revoked, and semi-official clubs of the directorial regime called constitutional circles invited all good republicans into a coalition against the monarchists.

[(19:30)](#!):

But as the elections of year six approached, the directorial regime felt like it had a pretty good handle on the right wing, and that it now had to block the left if it was going to stay in power.

[(19:41)](#!):

And the elections scheduled for the spring of 1798 were critically important. Not only would this election clear out the last of the old Termidorians, who had been in power since the national convention, but it was also slated to fill all the vacancies created by the coup of Fructidor. So in all, 437 seats were up for grabs. So unlike the elections of year five, when the Directory waited for the voting to run its course and then react to the results, for the elections of year six, they made careful plans to control the process from beginning to end.

[(20:17)](#!):

In January 1798, they passed a credentialing law that said that the outgoing legislative councils would have the right to confirm the elected delegates before they would be allowed to take their seats. This law further implied that the outgoing legislative councils would be the ones verifying the election results and passing final judgment on any electoral disputes. And then, this is key, they sent agents out to make sure there were as many electoral disputes as possible.

[(20:48)](#!):

Then in February, the regime passed a further law that the next new director would be elected by the outgoing legislative councils rather than the incoming legislative councils. So this whole thing was rigged from the get-go.

[(21:02)](#!):

The primary electoral assembly started meeting at the end of March 1798, and right away supporters of the regime worked hard to muddy the waters. The basic tactic was to intentionally create schisms within the various electoral assemblies. So you take for example a Parisian electoral assembly that has 609 total electors. Agents of the regime then determined that two-thirds of those guys were ready to vote for opposition candidates. So they go out, gin up a technical violation, and lead 212 electors in a walkout, reconvene them down the street as the true and legitimate electoral assembly, and elect a list of pro-regime candidates, mostly drawn from the ranks of government appointees who owed their jobs and livelihoods to the existing regime. So now there would be two rival slates of candidates. So oh no, I guess we have to submit our dispute to the sitting legislative councils and have them decide which slate of delegates is legitimate. This sort of maneuvering went on all over the place.

[(22:05)](#!):

The most useful technical violation was to trot out the law that had been imposed by Lazar Carnot that said candidates and electors had to swear a hatred of monarchy and the Constitution of 1793. So wherever anti-regime leftists won, the regime candidates would just assert that they were for anarchy and the Constitution of 1793 and had just perjured themselves. The anti-regime candidates would of course deny it, and then lo and behold you’ve got another disputed vote that needs resolving.

[(22:37)](#!):

With the returns starting to come back, and those returns not looking good for the regime, the legislative councils then announced on May the 2nd that they had uncovered a conspiracy between royalists and the left-wing anarchists to undermine the republic. This is just as Robespierre had once denounced Hebert as an agent of the foreign plot who was trying to discredit the revolution. So the accusation now is that all these left-wing candidates wore the white cockade of royalism under the red cap of liberty.

[(23:09)](#!):

With this alleged threat looming, the legislative councils decided it would be prudent to quickly process all those utterly contrived electoral disputes. With so many contested elections out there, going through them one by one would drag on well into the summer. So on May the 7th, the Directory submitted a list full of summary judgments on which delegates would be allowed to take their seats and which would not. They asked the legislative councils to approve the whole slate all at once, which they did on May the 11th, 1798. That is, 22 Florial, year 6, which is why we call it the Coup of Florial.

[(23:49)](#!):

The Coup of Florial was not quite as sweeping as the coup of Fructidor. Though the Directory altered results in 49 of the 96 departments, only 8 departments had their elections outright annulled, and of the 437 open seats, only 127 candidates were declared invalid and replaced with regime-approved delegates. But that said, denying over a quarter of the men elected by a majority vote the seat that they had won was not going to earn the Directory any awards for meritorious conduct.

[(24:24)](#!):

And as it would turn out, many of the delegates who were allowed to take their seats because they weren’t implacable opponents of the regime became disillusioned enough with the government that they would not lift a finger to help the Directory during the Coup of Brumaire. Among those allowed to take their seats, for example, were two of Napoleon Bonaparte’s brothers, former ambassador to Rome Joseph and energetic younger brother Lucian, who will play a central role in the Coup of Brumaire.

[(24:54)](#!):

In one of their last acts, the sitting council of 500 and council of ancients replaced the oh-so-recently-appointed Neufchateau in the Directory. And in case you’re wondering why the oh-so-recently-appointed Neufchateau was still eligible for the retirement lottery, it was because he had taken over Carnot’s seat. So even though he himself was new, the seat he occupied was one of the original five. But super convenient that his name was picked out of the hat rather than one of the triumvirate. Wouldn’t you say?

[(25:27)](#!):

I sure would. Neufchateau was replaced by Jean-Baptiste Traillart, who we just met at the beginning of this episode, asserting that the Rhine territories did not constitute new territorial acquisitions. What Traillart’s election meant was that the Directory was now firmly controlled by men who would push aggressively for the projection of French power abroad rather than making any compromises with the rest of Europe that might tend to reduce the chances of a future war. Now while all of this was going on in Paris, Napoleon Bonaparte was down in Toulon, preparing to embark on the Egyptian expedition that would really super reduce the chances of avoiding a future war.

[(26:12)](#!):

The directors, as I mentioned, were quite happy to see him off. The leftist candidates they had just purged from the legislative councils were likely feared not half as much as the invincible little corporal who would now be thousands of miles away from home, either winning the Republic a great victory or disappearing into the sands of Egypt. The final destination of the expedition was a closely held secret. The directors, Talleyrand, and a few of Bonaparte’s closest aides knew. But other than that, everyone was kept in the dark.

[(26:47)](#!):

So though British intelligence was alerted to the fact that the French were massing forces in Mediterranean ports, they did not know where those forces were headed. By May 1798, 40,000 soldiers, 10,000 sailors, and literally hundreds of ships were prepared to set sail to wherever Bonaparte pointed. But of course, Napoleon did not just gather soldiers for his expedition. He also famously assembled a company of scientists, engineers, intellectuals, scholars, and artists to travel along with the army and make a great investigation of Egypt.

[(27:25)](#!):

Numbering 167 men in all, these guys were brought along for three big reasons.

[(27:32)](#!):

First, let it not be said that Bonaparte was not a child of the Enlightenment and an advocate of its progressive scientific principles. These academics would quite simply advance the sum total of human knowledge, a self-evident good. Second, on a more immediately practical level, these guys would be available to improve the supply lines for the French army, map out roads, identify sources of food and supplies, and then make sure it could all get from there to here. They would also hopefully get started on fulfilling one of Western Europe’s great engineering dreams, building a canal that would link the Red Sea to the Mediterranean and dramatically shorten the travel time to India and China. If that canal was built and controlled by the French, that would give them an insane strategic advantage over their rivals. Third, Bonaparte was a master propagandist. By bringing along all these scientists, he was able to paint the expedition as one of discovery and himself as an enlightened leader interested in the advancement of mankind rather than simply another general making a grab at Egypt to cripple the British and build his own personal power base.

[(28:46)](#!):

Even as things started to go badly for the French army in Egypt, the scientific hangers-on worked diligently and wound up producing a wealth of new observations and discoveries, the most famous and most consequential of which was of course the discovery of the Rosetta Stone. And next week, we’ll get into why the Rosetta Stone is currently sitting in the British Museum and not the Louvre.

[(29:09)](#!):

When Napoleon led the fleet out of Toulon on May the 19th, the ultimate destination was still unknown. Bonaparte had given a rousing speech to his men, but only hinted towards a foreign land rather than saying dudes were off to Egypt, because he was still trying to keep the British in the dark. And in this, he was actually quite successful. The British were of course well aware of the troop mobilizations, but do not appear to have seriously considered Egypt as the target. There’s a famous anecdote where the British Secretary of War says, well maybe they’re making a run at Egypt. And the Foreign Secretary says, try to think with a map in your hand. Basically, the French aren’t going to send their best general in 40,000 men to the other side of the Mediterranean, you jackass. Except that’s exactly what the French were doing.

[(30:00)](#!):

Now the biggest reason the British intelligence was so imperfect, and Napoleon could even dream of this kind of campaign in the first place, was because after Bonaparte started kicking the crap out of the Austrians in Italy in 1796, and then especially after the Spanish were forced to switch sides, maintaining a fleet in the Mediterranean was very dangerous for the British. So the Admiralty pulled the fleet out and stationed them at the mouth of the Tagus River, basically Lisbon, from which they ran a blockade of the Spanish port of Cadiz, and then went after any merchant vessels trying to pass through the Straits of Gibraltar that they thought might be trying to aid the French cause.

[(30:40)](#!):

But with the French obviously up to something, it was time to head back through the Straits of Gibraltar. Now the first order of business would be figuring out where the French fleet actually was, and where it was headed. For this, the Admiral in charge of the Mediterranean fleet appointed Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson. By this point, Nelson was already well on his way to becoming one of Britain’s great naval heroes, though his greatest triumph will come after we have left the French Revolution behind. But the success he will enjoy next week forms a major part of the legend of Admiral Nelson.

[(31:20)](#!):

Nelson had just returned to the Mediterranean fleet from London, where he had been recuperating after having one of his arms amputated from wounds suffered during a failed attempt to take the Canary Islands back in July 1797. Nelson was given command of a six-ship squadron, and told to go find out where the French were, and where they were headed. On May 9th, Nelson crossed through the Straits of Gibraltar back into the Mediterranean. What followed was something of a comedy of errors for both sides, as bad intelligence plagued everyone.

[(31:53)](#!):

Nelson’s little squadron arrived at Toulon on May 21st, and discovered the French had just departed, but then a storm came through and scattered the squadron. Nelson’s flagship and another ship of the line wound up anchored off the southwest coast of Sardinia.

[(32:09)](#!):

Meanwhile, Bonaparte’s fleet was hugging the coast, passing Genoa, picking up more ships and men and supplies, before crossing down and heading south along the east coast of Corsica and then Sardinia. On June 3rd, Bonaparte was alerted to the fact that the British had ships on the other side of Sardinia, and he sent a squadron to investigate, but by the time they got there, Nelson, which was the ship they were talking about, had already sailed back to Toulon trying to link back up with the rest of his squadron, not realizing how close he had come to spotting his quarry. So while Nelson sailed northwest towards Toulon, Bonaparte turned southeast towards Sicily.

[(32:49)](#!):

Then a few days later, the French captured a British merchant who said, oh yeah, I just saw Nelson. He’s got a whole fleet and he’s right on your heels. This caused Bonaparte to panic a little bit, and he ordered his fleet to race for the island of Malta. Now Malta was still run by the Knights of Malta, an old Crusades-era Brotherhood of Knights, and after the Grand Master of the Knights refused French entrance into the main harbor, Bonaparte fired his guns, landed some troops, and just took it. The knights never really stood a chance, especially because half the 2,000-man garrison were French themselves and had no interest in fighting their countrymen.

[(33:28)](#!):

Bonaparte promised the equivalent of three million livre in exchange for the island, and the Grand Master accepted, because what else was he going to do?

[(33:37)](#!):

But of course the intelligence about Nelson had been all wrong. Nelson had linked back up with some reinforcements, but he was nowhere near the French fleet, and even after he got moving again on June the 10th, he was told that the French were at Syracuse, when really they were on Malta. So this is a big problem with being out at sea with only stray captured vessels to rely on for information. For this whole opening game of where are the French and where are they going, both sides were working from horrible intelligence. It wasn’t until June the 20th that Nelson finally learned the French had been at Malta, and even then he was told that they had disembarked on June the 16th, when really they hadn’t left until June the 19th, like literally the day before Nelson got this news. So he was just 60 nautical miles away from the French and had no idea and no way of even having an idea.

[(34:31)](#!):

But one thing had become clear to both sides. The French were headed east. Before leaving Malta, Bonaparte finally decided it was safe to reveal to his men that the next stop would be Alexandria. Meanwhile Nelson huddled with his officers and concluded that the French were either headed for Constantinople or Egypt, with Egypt being the most likely target. A shrewd and correct guess.

[(34:57)](#!):

So next week, we will follow everyone to Egypt. Bonaparte will successfully land his army outside Alexandria and begin his great campaign. But then Nelson will swoop down and obliterate, and I mean obliterate the French navy anchored at Abakir Bay. Whatever Bonaparte did next, he was going to have a hell of a time getting home.

This week, I’m going to go back and recommend for a second time The Black Count by Tim Rees, a narrative history of the Haitian-born general Thomas Alexandre Dumas.

[(00:50)](#!):

I really thought I was going to have a chance to get into him, but he’s been just off to the left of the main narrative, and I just don’t have the time to spare. But just so you know, he was on the Italian campaigns. He single-handedly fought off a company of Austrians trying to take a bridge. He was the commander of cavalry during the Egyptian campaigns that I’m about to tell you about. Then he winds up captured, thrown in prison, and when he finally gets back to France, he’s all shunned by his former comrades, because he was not a fan of Napoleon Bonaparte’s endless self-aggrandizement. His is an amazing story.

So when you’re done with this episode, go get it. And get it at audiblepodcast.com forward slash revolutions so that they know who sent you. Episode 3.49 The Egyptian Expedition So as promised, this week we are going to spend the entire episode covering Napoleon Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt. We are going to stick with him for a whole year, all the way through August 1799, when Bonaparte decides that for the good of France, he must abandon his army and sail home to take control of the disintegrating situation back in Europe that we will discuss in detail next week. And oh by the way, what I really mean is that we’re going to stick with Bonaparte through August 1799, when he decides that for the good of his own damn self, he must abandon his army, because by then their situation would not just be deteriorating, it would be utterly hopeless. When Bonaparte knew if he stuck around, that would be the end of him.

[(02:39)](#!):

So we left off in June 1798, with Bonaparte’s massive fleet sailing from Malta to Alexandria, having somehow managed to slip by Admiral Nelson’s little squadron without being detected. The French soldiers now knew that they were headed to Egypt, and were likely licking their chops at the possibilities that lay before them. They were nearly 40,000 strong, well supported by a large fleet, led by the best general in France, and sailing towards a land of ancient wealth that was likely to be easily conquered. Personally, I would have been stoked to have been assigned to this expedition, but oh how everyone would come to regret it.

[(03:20)](#!):

As the fleet approached Alexandria, Bonaparte ensured that his men would approach the coming campaign not merely with the utmost military skill, but also with the utmost political skill. This was not just going to be a smash and grab job, Bonaparte wanted to establish a permanent French occupation, so he absolutely forbade any kind of looting or pillaging that might antagonize the natives, and further ordered that every man was to go out of his way to show respect and deference to Islam. A major part of Bonaparte’s political strategy was to ingratiate himself with the local imams, that is the Muslim religious leaders. He couldn’t have undisciplined soldiers out there ruining things by desecrating mosques or like spitting on the high priests.

[(04:08)](#!):

The other big component of Bonaparte’s political strategy though, was to paint the French expedition as an army of liberation. An army of liberation? How were a bunch of French republicans going to sell themselves as liberators in Egypt? I mean, who on earth did the Egyptians need to be liberated from? The answer is the Mamelukes, okay? So what the heck is a Mameluke? Now the word Mameluke just meant slave, and oddly enough, that’s what they were, slaves. But a very special kind of slave, warrior slaves.

[(04:46)](#!):

Purchased as children and raised into an elite warrior caste, the Mamelukes acted as standing armies or permanent bodyguards for rulers across the Muslim world. And in some cases, their power and prestige became so great that these warrior slaves were able to push aside the nominal rulers and wield power directly, as was the case in Egypt. The Mamelukes wound up seizing Egypt way back in 1250, setting up what’s called the Mameluke Sultanate that ruled an independent Egypt until 1517. At that point, they were conquered by the Ottoman Turks and the independent Sultanate was dissolved. But once inside the greater Ottoman Empire, the Mamelukes in Egypt carved out a great deal of autonomy for themselves. And by the time Napoleon arrived, Egypt was once again basically a self-governing unit ruled by two Mameluke leaders who shared power with each other. One guy named Murad Bey, who ran the military, and his partner, Ibrahim Bey, who handled civilian administration. And just so you know, no, they are not brothers, Bey just means governor inside the Ottoman Empire. But the thing to keep in mind here is that the Mamelukes are foreigners. They are purchased into service from places like the Caucasus or the Balkans, and they are not native Egyptians. So when the French landed in July 1798, Bonaparte circulated a proclamation to the native Egyptians that said the French were here to rid them of the tyrant Mamelukes. And then that’s what he set out to do.

[(06:20)](#!):

The French landed near Alexandria on July the 1st, and Bonaparte was informed that Alexandria was preparing to resist. So he rushed 5,000 men ashore and then ran them ahead that very first night right up under the walls of the city. So when the Alexandrians woke up the next morning, they found the French at the gates and their defensive arrangements not yet complete. The soldiers garrisoning Alexandria ditched out the back door, and the French entered the city. With the port captured, Bonaparte then landed the rest of his army without incident.

[(06:53)](#!):

But the real target was the Mameluke capital, Cairo, located a couple hundred miles up the Nile into the Egyptian interior. So without ever really even pausing to catch his breath, Bonaparte broke his army up into two and sent them marching towards Cairo from two directions. The division led by Bonaparte hugged the coastline and then turned and followed the Nile due south along the west bank of the river.

[(07:19)](#!):

Other division plunged southeast out of Alexandria headed straight across the desert, and this was not the route you wanted to get sent on. Not only was it the hottest and driest part of the year, but the French column was harassed the entire way by Bedouin raiders, pity the Frenchmen who strayed from the pack.

The guys coming up the Nile were accompanied by a small flotilla of gunboats. But obviously the rest of the fleet couldn’t just sail up the Nile, so while he marched into the interior, Bonaparte told the French admiral to anchor at Abu Khirbe, about 20 miles northeast of Alexandria, and stay put. But only to stay put if the fleet was absolutely free of any potential danger. If there was even a hint of trouble, they were to sail all the way to Corfu, an island off the west coast of Greece in the Ionian Sea. The army would be able to take care of itself for a while, but it was imperative in the long run that the French fleet remain intact. The worst possible thing that could happen would be for the fleet to be destroyed by the British. And that, I believe, is what they call foreshadowing.

[(08:32)](#!):

The Mameluke military commander, Murad Bey, made his first little stand against the French coming up the Nile, outside the town of Shubrakit on July 13th. And though the French outnumbered them 23,000 to 14,000, the Mamelukes had a massive cavalry advantage. And not only that, heavy cavalry was the particular speciality of the Mamelukes. It was what they did best, and it was why they ruled Egypt. But this was a new world, and it was a new world that Napoleon was helping to create right there on the spot.

[(09:08)](#!):

To counter the Mameluke cavalry, Bonaparte formed his divisions into rectangular formations somewhat imprecisely dubbed divisional squares. These rectangles were six men deep and hollow at the center, which is where all the baggage and supplies and senior officers went. Artillery was then positioned at each corner, and everyone was told to hold their ground and fire at the charging cavalry as soon as they came into range. As it turned out, the divisional square was virtually impregnable. And in terms of Napoleon’s contributions to modern military tactics, the divisional square is right up there with the attack on the rear and the strategy of the central position. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, everyone would be using divisional squares.

[(09:54)](#!):

Once Merid Baye realized that his cavalry charges were getting all his men killed and were doing exactly zero damage to the French, he retreated further up the Nile. After Schubert-Kitt, the French army coming up the Nile linked with the army coming out of the desert, and they all made the final push towards Cairo together. Old Cairo was located on the east side of the river, so Merid Baye massed 25,000 men on the west side of the river to prevent the French from crossing. Inside Cairo, Ibrahim Baye was waiting with reinforcements, but he could not get those reinforcements across the river in time to join the fight.

[(10:33)](#!):

On July 21st, the two armies met outside the fortress city of Embabe. But about nine miles off in the distance, the Pyramids of Giza were visible. And so after the battle was won, Bonaparte decided that the Battle of the Pyramids sounded way cooler than the Battle of Embabe, or the Battle of Cairo, which is why we call it the Battle of the Pyramids. The battle itself was basically just a repeat of Schubert-Kitt on a larger scale. The French formed into five massive divisional squares and repelled every cavalry charge thrown against them. The Mamluk army lost a literally uncounted number of men. Napoleon would write home that the number was 20,000, which is, you know, insane, but thousands and thousands and thousands at least, and most of them elite cavalry. The French reported 29 dead and 260 wounded.

[(11:28)](#!):

Muradbe fled with the remnants of his army deep into the upper Nile. Meanwhile, his partner, Ibrahimbe, abandoned Cairo and fled northeast. Bonaparte then set off in pursuit of Ibrahimbe, caught up with him, and after a quick battle sent the remaining Mamluks running clear out of Egypt and up into Syria. And this effectively ended 500 years of Mamluk rule in Egypt. So things are looking great for Bonaparte. But little does he know that just a week and a half later all of his fancy plans are going to get blown to smithereens.

[(12:06)](#!):

As instructed, the French admiral had taken his 13 ships of the line, each with 74 guns and four frigates that had 36 or 40 guns apiece, into Abakirbe. But he disagreed with Bonaparte’s assessment that the army could live without the navy, and when he surveyed the scene, he decided that he could anchor his fleet in such a way that he would be able to repel any British attack. The critical point was that he thought that his line, which was arrayed northwest to southeast, was anchored to the northwestern shoal so tightly that the British could only approach from the east, which was not only at the strongest part of the French fleet, but against the prevailing winds. This however, is not how it is going to go.

[(12:53)](#!):

On August the 1st, 1798, Admiral Nelson arrived at Alexandria with a fleet that was basically the same size as the French. He had 13 74-gun ships of the line, and a fourth rate, which is a ship of the line with 50 guns. But of course when he got to Alexandria, all he found was some light ships and a few transports. The main fleet was gone. But his ship scouted around, and one of them finally, finally, finally spotted the French fleet they had all been looking for for two and a half months.

[(13:25)](#!):

Nelson’s fleet arrived at Abacur Bay at about 6pm on August the 1st. Now the French admiral sighted them, but assumed it was too late for an attack, and that he would have the night to make preparations for a battle in the morning. But instead, Nelson just charged right in. Focusing all his attention on the northwest side of the French line, that supposedly impregnable northwest side of the line, the British were able to double and triple team the targeted French ships, while their brethren arrayed down to the southeast, struggled against the winds to join the fight.

[(14:01)](#!):

And then came the real thing. One of the British captains recognized that there was a navigable gap between the French line and the western shoals, and on his own initiative he sailed through, soon followed by three more ships.

[(14:15)](#!):

The French were now surprised, surrounded and getting blasted from all sides. The French admiral was mortally wounded in the initial attack by a cannon blast. The French attempted valiantly to hold out, but their morale was crushed when a fire broke out on the deck of the Orient, the great flagship of the French fleet. At about 10 o’clock that night, the Orient just exploded. Kaboom. It sunk to the bottom, and as treasure hunters know well, it took with it a huge load of Maltese gold that has never been recovered.

[(14:51)](#!):

Apparently, fighting stopped everywhere for about 10 minutes as a result of this massive explosion.

[(14:57)](#!):

But when the fighting resumed, it practically turned into a mere mop-up operation for the British. With half the French fleet already destroyed or captured, the other half tried to make good their escape. But the British were right on top of them and trapped them inside the bay. Only two ships of the line and two frigates escaped. Of the 17 ships of the French fleet, 14 were either destroyed or captured. The British lost none. It was a spectacular victory for Admiral Nelson and a crushing defeat for the French.

[(15:34)](#!):

So Bonaparte was on his way back to Cairo from his pursuit of Ibrahim Bay when the messengers arrived with news of the disastrous loss of the fleet. But though this must have been a knife to the gut, Bonaparte affected a cocky posture. Basically, eh, no big deal, we’ll stay, do what we came here to do, and when we leave I guess we’ll just have to conquer our way home. I mean, Caesar did it. That was the, uh, Vinny Vidi Vici campaign.

[(16:02)](#!):

But in private, he had to have known how much the loss of the fleet wrecked everything. And on top of everything else, the British victory at the now so-called Battle of the Nile convinced the Ottoman Empire to join a new anti-French coalition, the Second Coalition, which we’ll talk about next week.

[(16:22)](#!):

But Bonaparte continued to proceed as if it was all good. The first step would be a reorganization of the Egyptian political system now that the French were in charge. Well, maybe not a complete reorganization. What Bonaparte wanted to do was graft a new top-level administration on top of the existing system. So he appointed new divans to run various districts in prominent city. These divans, which is a word meaning a member of the Ottoman Privy Council, were natives, but personally selected by Bonaparte to tie their loyalty not just to the French, but to him personally.

[(16:59)](#!):

He hoped eventually to create semi-representative ruling councils that would advise each divan, but the plans never got that far. And then, as I mentioned, he considered the buy-in from local Muslim leaders to be critical, and so he bent over backwards to flatter and cultivate them as allies. He gave them all kinds of favors and gifts and special perks. His letters are filled with professions of respect and admiration for Islam. And when the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday came around on August the 21st, Napoleon personally led a huge celebration in Cairo.

[(17:35)](#!):

Aside from his political operations, Bonaparte also cut loose with an array of modernization projects, spearheaded by all the science and engineering nerds attached to the expedition.

[(17:46)](#!):

So the French arrival in Egypt is occasionally pointed to as the beginning of quote-unquote modern Egypt because of all the new stuff the French introduced. They pioneered new urban sanitary measures, they rebuilt canals, founded an official postal service, they brought in windmills, started working on a system of structured irrigation to replace the flood inundation that had been the basis of Egyptian agriculture for I don’t even know how many thousands of years, and the French also brought in the first printing press and launched the first newspapers, mostly as organs of pro-French propaganda. But still, this is a pretty big deal.

[(18:24)](#!):

The French science nerds then formed themselves into a society called the Egyptian Institute, with a headquarters in Cairo, where they would house, catalog, and analyze all the material they planned to go out and study. And these guys were interested in everything. Archaeology, anthropology, botany, zoology, geology, hydraulics, linguistics, you name it, they were into it. They set up a main library, an astronomical observatory, laboratories, a botanical garden, a menagerie, and eventually their accumulated artifacts, data, observations, drawings, notes were all compiled into a series of volumes that were called the Description of Egypt.

[(19:06)](#!):

Now the series did not start publication until 1809, but after that, 37 volumes were published before it ceased in 1826. And the Egyptian Institute, by the by, disbanded in 1801 after the final French surrender, but it was revived in 1836 as a little coalition of French, English, and German academics, and it still exists in Cairo today. It used to house something like 200,000 super-rare manuscripts, many of them gathered by Napoleon’s original crew, until it was burned down by an errant Molotov cocktail during the Egyptian uprising in 2011. Protesters and soldiers apparently both rushed inside to save what they could, but they only managed to pull out 30,000 to 40,000 documents. Sigh. Oh, also, ISIS just blew up the Temple of Balsam in Palmyra the other day. Double sigh.

[(20:06)](#!):

Just to jump ahead a little bit while we’re on the topic, by far the biggest discovery by the French expedition was the Rosetta Stone, which was discovered in April 1799 by an engineering officer assisting in the re-fortification of the port city of Rosetta. He basically unearthed this large slab of black rock covered in ancient scribbles and said, hmm, this looks important, I think I’ll go tell one of the science nerds. And yes, it turned out to be pretty important. The Rosetta Stone is a decree that was carved in 196 BC during the reign of the Hellenistic king Ptolemy V. It was written in three different languages. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, pictograms that no one yet understood, demonic Egyptian, a rarely used and little understood left to right reading phonetic script, and then ancient Greek, which everyone understood. Members of the Egyptian Institute guessed, correctly as it turned out, that it was the same passage written in three languages, and that because they all knew Greek, that this might be the key to cracking the hieroglyphs. And it was, though it would be another 20 years before they were finally deciphered, and most of the credit going to the Englishman Thomas Young and the Frenchman Jean-Francois Champollion, but now we’re straying away from the story. They found the Rosetta Stone. Now we can read hieroglyphs. It was a big deal.

[(21:33)](#!):

Anyway, despite Napoleon’s cultivation of the Muslim leaders, they were paying more attention to his deeds than his words, and to them, all of these French modernization efforts looked mostly like cultural imperialism by atheist Europeans trying to wipe out traditional Islamic culture. But even if they didn’t think that, they couldn’t help but notice the vast array of new taxes being imposed by the French. And I doubt they would have taken much solace in the knowledge that the French weren’t doing anything different to Muslims in Egypt than they were doing to, say, Catholics in Belgium.

[(22:10)](#!):

The local religious leaders were helped along in their brewing hatred of the French by contact with the British and the Ottoman Turks, both of whom were saying, don’t believe a word Bonaparte says. Revolutionary France is about naked conquest and sacrilegious atheism. So the leaders in Cairo started to talk amongst themselves about booting the French out. Then they got a hold of some weapons and started to actively plot how to boot the French out.

[(22:38)](#!):

In mid-October, the Imams began to spread guns throughout the native population of Cairo and urging everyone to join in a holy insurrection to expel the foreign invaders. On October 22, 1798, they launched an armed uprising using the Great Mosque as a base. It was a semi-organized bloodbath and any Frenchman caught out in the open was simply killed and that included the French general in charge of the garrison and one of Napoleon’s aide-de-camps. Bonaparte himself was outside the city when the uprising began but it did not take him long to rally a force to come pacify the city. He pushed his way in and then his men toured through the hastily erected Egyptian barricades. The French army then marched street by street, clearing everything in front of them and pushing the insurrectionaries back towards the Great Mosque. A brief standoff at the mosque ensued but Bonaparte, who was in a wee bit of a mood, opened up with the heavy guns. The French blasted their way in and killed everyone inside. So I guess we’re not worried about desecrating mosques anymore?

[(23:45)](#!):

In total, the French lost about 300 men, the local Egyptians somewhere on the order of 5,000 to 6,000. As further punishment, Cairo was hit with a punitive tax, their local divan was replaced by a direct French military commissioner, and anyone identified as a leader in the uprising was arrested and executed. These were harsh measures but for the rest of the time Bonaparte was in Egypt, there were no more revolts. So at the end of 1798, the French occupation of Egypt was relatively secure, though how permanent it could possibly be given that they were completely cut off from Europe was an open question.

[(24:26)](#!):

Bonaparte though, kept acting like it was going to be permanent. And in December, he gathered up a company of about 300 guys and headed down to Suez, the main port on the north end of the Red Sea.

[(24:39)](#!):

Now as I mentioned last week, one of the great dreams of the European powers was to carve out a canal that would link the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. As it stood right then, if you wanted to travel entirely by sea from Europe to India and China, you had to go around the tip of Africa, a long and arduous journey. You could cut the distance by something like 4,000 miles if you sailed up into the Red Sea, put in at Suez and handed everything off to hired porters or sold it to Arab middlemen and had them carry it up to the Mediterranean ports. But just adding those couple hundred miles by land jacked up the price of everything. I mean, just do the math on how many men and camels it would take to carry off the cargo that was loaded into just a single big ship. It was doable, and the British in particular were doing it. They used the Red Sea as a primary link to India, and this is one of the big reasons Bonaparte was so interested in Egypt. It would force the British to rely entirely on that long route around the Cape of Good Hope, making it much easier to run out, say, a combined navy of Spanish, Dutch, and French ships to isolate the British home island completely.

[(25:51)](#!):

And then, if the French could build a canal from Suez to the Mediterranean, the sea route would be cut by 4,000 miles and the French would have a near monopoly on the Asian trade. So like I say, Bonaparte had big, fancy plans here.

[(26:07)](#!):

Now what his little expedition to Suez was looking for in particular was the legendary Canal of the Pharaohs that had been attested to in numerous ancient sources. It had allegedly been built back in the 500s BC, running west to the Nile, rather than north directly to the Mediterranean. This legendary canal was abandoned after it was cut off from the Nile by shifts in the course of the river, but after some methodical searching, the party actually found the remains of the Canal of the Pharaohs, and they set to work studying its course and construction.

[(26:42)](#!):

Now unfortunately for Bonaparte, he personally had to leave the mission in January 1799 because messengers arrived bearing the news that the Ottomans had finally been convinced to throw their whole weight against the French. They were massing to invade Egypt on two fronts, a land army swinging down through Syria and a sea army massing at Rhodes that would sail down and put in at Alexandria.

[(27:07)](#!):

Napoleon likely expected something like this ever since the Ottomans had joined the war because it took him no time to launch a bold preemptive strike against the Ottoman army coming down through Syria. Rather than waiting for the Ottomans to come to him, he collected 13,000 men in February 1799 and marched them north into Syria to halt the Ottoman advance before they got anywhere near Egypt. And while he was at it, he would be able to capture a bunch of ports to strengthen the French position in the east.

[(27:39)](#!):

On March 3, 1799, Bonaparte hit his first major objective, the port city of Jaffa, which is roughly where modern Tel Aviv is. Taking Jaffa was critical because the rest of Bonaparte’s campaign was premised on floating up heavy guns and siege equipment rather than hauling it overland through the desert and for that he needed a local port. Bonaparte expected Jaffa to just give up, but they refused. And not only did they refuse, but they beheaded the Turkish envoy Napoleon had sent in to negotiate their surrender. This insult infuriated Bonaparte. The French assaulted the city for four days until they finally fought their way in on March 7. Bonaparte let his guys run wild for two straight days on a nonstop terror campaign. Thousands were killed in the looting and destruction that followed. So I guess we’re not worried about pillaging the natives anymore?

[(28:38)](#!):

The siege and occupation of Jaffa was also right around the time the French army was hit with a problem that would plague them, not just for the rest of this campaign, but for the rest of their time in the east. The plague. Literally, the plague. In March 1799, the plague started spreading ominously through the ranks of the French army, which impacted not just the basic health of the soldiers, but also their morale. The plague is a scary business. So before leaving Jaffa, Bonaparte set up a plague hospital to quarantine sick troops, and allegedly went and visited the victims personally to prove to the rest of his men that there was nothing to fear, and there’s a famous painting creatively called Bonaparte Visiting Plague Victims at Jaffa that depicts him laying hands on a sick man. But it is entirely possible that the entire visit was concocted propaganda. Napoleon personally commissioned this painting in 1804 on the eve of his self-coronation as emperor. And if there’s one solid staple of semi-divine rule across time and space, it’s the power of the ruler to heal the sick.

[(29:47)](#!):

After depositing a garrison to hold Jaffa, Bonaparte marched with the rest of his army north, to the city of Acre, where a good portion of the incoming Ottoman army were stationed, awaiting further reinforcements from Damascus. The French began a siege on March 20th, and Bonaparte confidently predicted that Acre would fall in a matter of days, and then they could all move on. But instead, this was as far as his army was going to go in the Syrian campaign. The Ottoman defenders were well led by a French emigre officer, who also happened to be a former classmate of Bonaparte’s. Supplied by the British navy with provisions and equipment, the garrison at Acre settled in to outlast the French.

[(30:31)](#!):

And then came the critical blow. The flotilla bringing in the French siege equipment was captured by the British navy, leaving Napoleon with only infantry to carry out his siege and no way to prevent the British from resupplying the city at will. To add insult to injury, the British then delivered the captured guns to Acre, where they were used against the French.

[(30:53)](#!):

With the siege stalled out, Bonaparte then got news that a huge relief army was on the way from Damascus. Napoleon dispatched 2,000 men under General Jean-Baptiste Cl\xc3\xa9bert, a guy who I have been ignoring so far in the show in the interest of narrative clarity, but Cl\xc3\xa9bert has been around for a while now. He was part of that Mainz garrison that was forced to surrender way back in the summer of 1793 and was then transferred over to the Vend\xc3\xa9e, where they played a crucial role in defeating the insurrectionary Catholic and royal army later that year. General Cl\xc3\xa9bert was one of the lead Republican generals in that run of battles out in the West in September-October 1793. Well now, he’s with Napoleon in Egypt, and he’s off with 2,000 men to face 35,000 Ottomans. And despite the insane numerical difference, he actually liked his chances so much that he decided to go on the offensive. Cl\xc3\xa9bert located the relief army camped at the base of Mount Tabor, and he scheduled a night raid for the wee hours of April 16th that would hopefully confuse and scatter the enemy. But unfortunately, it took Cl\xc3\xa9bert longer to get into position than he planned, and so when dawn broke on the 16th, the little army was spotted. The surprise raid botched, Cl\xc3\xa9bert formed his army into two compact divisional squares, and for the next ten hours fought off wave after wave of Mamluk cavalry. Holding out was actually pretty easy, but by the end of the day, the French were running low on food, water, and ammunition.

[(32:33)](#!):

But that is when Bonaparte showed up leading another 2,000 men. Having heard of the pickle Cl\xc3\xa9bert had gotten himself into, Bonaparte scrambled a relief effort. And when Napoleon arrived at Mount Tabor, his idea was to attack the Ottoman baggage and force them to divert attention away from Cl\xc3\xa9bert. And this worked beyond his wildest expectations, because when Bonaparte attacked the baggage, the Ottoman soldiers suddenly believed that they were surrounded, so they panicked and retreated south. And as soon as they started to run, both Bonaparte and Cl\xc3\xa9bert’s armies pursued them and turned the retreat into a chaotic rout. Just like that, this huge Ottoman relief army was busted and scattered to the four winds, leaving thousands of dead behind.

[(33:23)](#!):

But though they had stopped the relief army from coming, the siege of Acre still ended in failure for the French. The plague was continuing to spread, and they had no real way of breaking into the city. After one last-ditch assault on May 10th, Bonaparte decided to give up. Sort of. He announced to his men that since they had defeated the Ottomans and taken a string of cities, that their work here was done. They were victorious already and didn’t need dumb ol’ Acre anyway. Basically, he declared victory and left.

[(33:56)](#!):

But the march home was pretty brutal. All the sick had to be kept quarantined in the back of the army, and the wounded could only move so fast. Their slow progress exposed the retreating French to repeated Ottoman raids. So eventually, anyone who couldn’t keep up was just abandoned. And there is a story that after passing back through Jaffa, that Bonaparte ordered a surgeon to administer lethal doses of laudanum to men infected with the plague, but the doctor refused to do it.

[(34:26)](#!):

At the end of June, Bonaparte arrived back in Cairo, and keeping up appearances, he entered the city like some conquering hero. But the four-month campaign had cost him 600 dead of the plague, 1200 killed in action, and 2000 wounded, none of whom could be replaced. And it netted him only a temporary reprieve from an Ottoman offensive via Syria. Because meanwhile, this other 20,000-man Ottoman army was being ferried by the British navy from Rhodes down to Alexandria.

[(34:59)](#!):

And I have to think that right about now is the time Bonaparte looks around and says, this is a hopeless situation, I’m cut off, I have no hope of reinforcement, I’m governing a probably hostile native population with a dwindling army weakened by plague, there is very little chance of permanent success to be had here. But there was nothing he could do about his situation at the moment, except try to counter this seaborne Ottoman invasion.

[(35:27)](#!):

On July the 14th, 1799, that is the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, the British navy landed the Ottoman army at Alexandria and easily established a beachhead and captured the city, which was not particularly well-garrisoned. On July the 25th, Bonaparte arrived with about 7,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, and saw that the Ottomans were deploying themselves in two defensive lines with their backs to the sea, which Napoleon quickly deduced left them nowhere to run if it got bad for them. So he ordered his men to attack, and they broke through the first Ottoman line before it had a chance to fully form. They had a tougher time cracking the inner line, but the French cavalry general Joachim Murat identified a weak point on the Ottoman flank, turned it, and charged in behind them. Murat charged so fast that he broke into the tent of the Ottoman high command and personally captured the Ottoman commander-in-chief, taking a gunshot to Ja for his trouble. But Murat will live, as we’ll see.

[(36:32)](#!):

The broken Ottomans tried to flee, scatter, swim back to the British ships, whatever. Of the 18,000 who put to shore, 6,000 died, 1,500 were captured, and 2,000 just went missing. The French casualties, again, numbered in the mere hundreds.

[(36:51)](#!):

But though here we are, with Bonaparte having won every open battle he fought in Egypt and Syria and won them all in pretty spectacular fashion, none of it changed the larger strategic picture. Bonaparte’s army was still cut off from home and could expect no relief or reinforcement. And then the British admiral running the fleet that had been blockading Bonaparte from all possible relief decided it was high time to let news from Europe finally get through to the French. He forwarded dispatches that spelled out the scope of the disasters that had befallen the French army in the year since Bonaparte had left for Egypt, disasters he had no knowledge of until that moment, and disasters that we will pick our way through next week.

[(37:37)](#!):

Napoleon concluded that if France was going to be saved, and more importantly if his glorious personal ambitions were going to be saved, that he was going to have to ditch the men he had dragged to Egypt and sail for home. And with this latest resounding victory against the Ottomans, he could return home bearing good tidings of his unbroken string of triumphs. Now he did not dare tell his men he was leaving, though. Pretending to be headed merely on a scouting expedition to the Nile Delta, Bonaparte boarded a frigate with a small company of loyal associates as night fell on August the 22nd, 1799. Then he sailed for France.

[(38:17)](#!):

The next morning, General Cl\xc3\xa9bert got up and read the proclamation announcing Bonaparte’s departure, and that he himself had been pointed commander in chief. Now this practically led to a riot, but Cl\xc3\xa9bert told him, no, no, guys, it’s cool, he’s just going home to get reinforcements, I swear. But this was a bald-faced lie. Bonaparte is not coming back.

[(38:41)](#!):

So all those men who had been licking their chops as they sailed from Malta to Alexandria in June 1798, and who counted themselves as lucky ducks for getting picked to go off on this grand adventure with Napoleon Bonaparte, were utterly abandoned to their fate. Those that weren’t already dead of the plague, or had been killed in battle, or in native uprisings, that is.

[(39:05)](#!):

Now just to wrap up the fate of these poor guys, since it will extend beyond the scope of the show, the French occupation went pretty much as you’d expect. His army dwindling, and with no expectation that Bonaparte was ever coming back, Cl\xc3\xa9bert opened up negotiations with the British and Ottomans, promising to abandon Egypt if they were all just allowed to go home to France.

[(39:27)](#!):

But after agreeing to these terms, the British reneged in March 1800, and landed a huge Mamluk army to destroy the supposedly fatally weakened French army. But Cl\xc3\xa9bert won the subsequent Battle of Heliopolis, but then he himself was assassinated by an angry native in June. The demoralized French hung out until 1801, when the last of them finally wound up holed up in Alexandria, besieged by a British expeditionary force that finally secured the French surrender in September 1801.

[(40:00)](#!):

And we’ll end today by noting that this surrender is the reason why the Rosetta Stone sits today in the British Museum, and not the Louvre. The details are sketchy, but it appears that the British knew all about the stone, and just straight up jacked it and sailed it back to London, where it remains to this day.

[(40:20)](#!):

Next week, we will wind back the clock a bit, and pick up that deteriorating situation back in Europe that I’ve now hinted at a few times. A deteriorating situation that led to the formation of the Second Coalition, a coalition that now included the Russians and the Ottomans, and which General Bonaparte was convinced that it was his destiny to save France from, so that he himself could proceed with everything else he believed destiny had in store for him.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.50, The Second Coalition. So we spent all of last week with Napoleon in Egypt. This week, we are going to double back and follow the developments in Europe while Napoleon’s army was trapped in the east. And as we will see in a moment, it was largely because Napoleon had gone east that things were going to start to go so badly for the French back home. Because everyone else, it’s about to form a new anti-French coalition dubbed by history the Second Coalition.

[(02:44)](#!):

To wind the clock all the way back to the fall of 1797, the French Directory was feeling pretty good after the Treaty of Campo Formio. And with the coup of Fructidor having purged closet royalists and frankly anyone promoting a generous peace with France’s enemies, they were also feeling pretty aggressive. If you remember from two episodes back, the French negotiators at the Congress of Ristat were pretty well trying to dictate terms to get an even better deal for themselves. The deal Bonaparte had made at Campo Formio was actually pretty unpopular in the post-Fructidor halls of the Directory. So the talks at Ristat had quickly ground to a halt as the French tried to extract further concessions from the Germans.

[(03:27)](#!):

But it wasn’t just French hubris that was stalling out the Congress of Ristat. Every one of the nearly 2,000 component parts of the Holy Roman Empire were trying to work the Congress to their advantage. In particular, the secular princes who had lost the lands west of the Rhine wanted to be compensated with lands east of the Rhines, and they eyed the various ecclesiastic principalities as the best source of new territory. So a bunch of the secular German princes actually now saw the French as diplomatic allies rather than enemies, because as we all know, there is nothing the French like more than stripping the Church of Land and giving it away practically for free. These princes were already pretty annoyed at the Habsburgs for not fighting harder to protect the left bank properties, and then when Bonaparte swung through Ristat on his way back to Paris in December 1797, he made the Austrians agree to pull out of the critical fortress city of Mainz, and that is when the princes just threw up their hands. The Habsburgs were abdicating their imperial responsibilities, so why even bother supporting them anymore? In response to the withdrawal from Mainz, the German journalist Joseph Gorres wrote, On 30 December 1797, the day of the handing over of Mainz, at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, there died peacefully and blessedly at the ripe old age of 955 years, 5 months, and 28 days, as the result of total enervation and a final stroke, completely conscious and comforted by the Holy Sacraments, the Holy Roman Empire of ponderous memory.

[(05:03)](#!):

And he was not far off. This was the beginning of the end. The Holy Roman Empire would formally dissolve just shy of 10 years hence after the Battle of Austerlitz in 1806, and many of the seeds that helped that disillusion along were planted at the Congress of Ristat.

[(05:23)](#!):

The Austrians, for their part, were blissfully unaware of their impending doom. They surveyed the scene and said, well, look, the French didn’t beat us that badly. Sure, Bonaparte kicked us around in Italy, but every time the French had crossed the Rhine, we had booted them right back across again. So even as the Austrians were agreeing to things in principle, it was clear that they were beginning to view Campo Formio as a mere ceasefire rather than the beginnings of a stable peace. So though the Congress agreed to French control of the left bank in March 1798 and then compensation to the affected princes with ecclesiastic property in April, there was an awful lot of kicking the can down the road going on. And then Bonaparte and 40,000 men sailed for Egypt a month after that, and that’s when the Congress of Ristat really ground to a halt. The French thought they were about to conquer like the whole Mediterranean, and the Austrians just watched the one guy who had really given them trouble sail far, far away.

[(06:22)](#!):

The Directory’s supreme confidence that they were on their way to being masters of the whole world then got a little boost in the spring of 1798 when the Irish suddenly rose up in rebellion against the British.

[(06:35)](#!):

Bonaparte had convinced the Directory that attacking England itself would be folly, but helping to drag the British into a quagmire in Ireland? That still seemed like a perfectly reasonable ambition. Patriotic Irishmen in Paris, particularly the famous revolutionary wolf Tone, had been telling the French for years that all the Irish needed was money and guns and a stiff backbone made up of professional French soldiers, and they could make serious trouble for the British in Ireland. Trouble that would hopefully culminate with independence for Ireland. Now they had tried this and failed once before, as we all know, in 1796, but that was just because of the weather.

[(07:17)](#!):

The failed French invasion of 1796, though, had put the British on notice that the Irish might actually be serious about rising up. So the British authorities had begun to play Protestant patriots, mostly up in Ulster, against Catholic patriots. Both sides wanted an independent Ireland, and they had come together to form a coalition called the United Irishmen, but the British were doing a pretty good job convincing the Protestants that the Catholics were just going to turn around and hand independent Ireland over to the Pope. With the Patriot movement internally divided, the British authorities then cracked down hard in March 1798. Ireland was put under de facto martial law, and the authorities swept through Dublin arresting everyone identified as a potential rebel leader.

[(08:04)](#!):

But though the sweep was thorough, the British didn’t get everyone, and the patriot leaders who remained at large decided they needed to get going now or lose any chance they might have. So these leaders planned a general uprising that would begin in Dublin and the surrounding counties and then hopefully spread across the island, and they set it to begin on May 23, 1798. Unfortunately, on the eve of their revolt, the entire plan was betrayed, and so when the Irish patriots in Dublin started gathering at their agreed rendezvous points, they were surprised by sudden swarms of British troops. The insurrection in Dublin itself was quashed before it even started.

[(08:45)](#!):

Now a few of the rebel groups in the surrounding counties managed to get their uprisings off the ground, but they were all put down within a matter of days. Then a little late to the party, up in Ulster, Protestant patriots decided to join the already semi-failed uprising in early June, but then they too were swiftly defeated within days. Now to deal with this sudden flare-up of rebellion, the British ministry appointed a new Lord Lieutenant to Ireland, a man with both military and administrative experience, and that is our old friend Charles Cornwallis, he of Yorktown.

[(09:22)](#!):

And the rebellion that Cornwallis dealt with was by no means over. Down in the Wicklow Mountains south of Dublin, a rebel general and about a thousand men managed to open up a guerrilla campaign that wound up lasting for years, even as the general himself surrendered in October 1798. The real action was even further south in Wexford. Wexford was not supposed to be the center of the rebellion, but it sure turned out to be. An uprising there began on May the 27th after the initial rebel defeats in Dublin, but once it got going, the patriots soon had an army 10,000 strong. They expelled the British authorities, declared themselves to be the colonel of a new Irish republic, and then attempted to break out of Wexford County and spread the rebellion. But in a series of battles in June, the rebels were defeated, culminating finally with a legitimately major engagement called the Battle of Vinegar Hill that pitted 20,000 Irish against 18,000 British. When the Irish were beat at Vinegar Hill though, that was pretty much the end of the Irish rebellion of 1798.

[(10:28)](#!):

So I know what you’re thinking. This is a podcast about the French Revolution. Why are we talking so much about what’s going on in Ireland? Where the hell are the French? Well, that’s exactly what the Irish are thinking too.

[(10:40)](#!):

Not exactly Johnny on the spot. The French did not land their first wave of support until August the 22nd. And that first wave of support was just a thousand men under General Jean Joseph Humbert. Yes, they landed two months after the rebellion had been pretty well suppressed. And when they did, they landed way up in northwest Ireland, which was nowhere near the center of the action. But when Humbert landed, he told the locals, look, another 3,000 guys are on the way. Do you want our help or not? About a thousand Irishmen rallied to Humbert’s banner. And a few days later, this combined French-Irish army actually beat 6,000 British militia forces in a battle that is called the Castle Bar Races. Because first, the British raced to block the French advance on the fortress of Castle Bar, and then the British raced away from the French when they got hit with their very first professional bayonet charge. After this initial victory, Humbert’s plan was to march up into Ulster, hopefully rally a bunch more Irish to join the fight. But the French found few supporters and no one really in the mood to take up arms. I mean, you guys heard the rebellion was actually crushed two months ago, right?

[(11:54)](#!):

So Lord Cornwallis then gathered up two pretty massive forces of about 15,000 men each, mostly militia, to protect Dublin and then go track down the French invaders. It took a while, but in September 1798, Humbert’s little army was finally cornered and surrounded. Humbert surrendered on September the 15th. And the French soldiers were allowed to be taken prisoner under civilized terms and then be repatriated to France. Their Irish comrades, on the other hand, were either summarily shot or, if they ran, tracked down and hanged. And that was the way it went all through the rebellion of 1798. After every confrontation, Irish rebels were shown zero mercy.

[(12:34)](#!):

So wait a minute, you say, what about the other 3,000 French? Funny thing about that, they took their sweet time getting moving and they didn’t land in Ireland until the middle of October 1798. That is, a good four months after the initial rebellion had been crushed and a month after their French brothers had surrendered. This latest and stupefyingly late attempt by the French to land troops in Ireland then itself came to disaster. When they reached the Irish coast, a British naval squadron pounced and after three hours fighting forced the French fleet to surrender. The great Irish revolutionary, Wolf Tone, was one of those captured and that’s how he winds up convicted, treason, and hanged in November 1798. If I decide to cover the Irish Revolution, we will talk more about Wolf Tone, I promise.

[(13:23)](#!):

So by now, the fall of 1798, the Directory’s supreme confidence has been a bit shaken. Their efforts in Ireland were coming to naught, just as they were digesting news of Nelson’s destruction of Bonaparte’s fleet at Abacur Bay. And it was that French defeat, more than anything else, that really got the ball rolling on the second coalition because it brought in two new players into the game, the Russians and the Ottomans.

[(13:52)](#!):

Ever since the fall of the Bastille, Catherine the Great’s Russia had been one of revolutionary France’s harshest and most consistent critics. The Russian court was also the most stable and generous benefactor of the emigre princes, where Austria and Prussia and Britain treated the emigres as a nuisance. Russia showered them with money, gifts, and if any of them made it to St. Petersburg, they received a warm reception. But as you may have noticed, Russia was nowhere to be found when the first coalition formed against France in 1793. Oh sure, Russia closed its ports to French shipping, but Catherine declined to participate in any actual fighting. As she herself declined to participate though, she was actively pushing the Austrians and Prussians to declare war. No doubt hoping that if they got bogged down fighting the French, that she would enjoy a much freer hand in Eastern Europe. The Russians were in the process of jumping up and down on the Ottomans, and Catherine planned to move next on Poland as soon as she was done. Now as we’ve seen, things didn’t exactly work out as Catherine planned. And when she did make her move on Poland, Prussia and Austria were right there to make sure that the subsequent Polish partitions didn’t go on without them.

[(15:04)](#!):

After the third Polish partition in 1795, Catherine was still looking south towards Turkey and Greece as the center of Russian foreign policy rather than west towards France. And she secured a secret promise from the Austrians during the negotiations over Poland to support a Russian move south if she decided to go for it. It really wasn’t until Bonaparte started whipping the Austrians in Italy that Catherine finally decided that the French republic she so loathed might actually pose a threat to her rising empire.

[(15:36)](#!):

As the Austrians were getting pushed out of Italy, she promised to raise 64,000 men to come join the fight. But even here, her pledge came with a major qualification. The now neutral Prussians had to pledge an equal number of troops, which the Prussians had no intention of doing. So it’s safe to say that Catherine the Great hated the French Revolution with every fiber of her being. She really did. But as long as no vital Russian interests were at stake, that hatred never translated into action. Russian foreign policy changed almost overnight in November 1796. Specifically November the 17th, 1796, because that was the day Catherine the Great died and her unstable son Paul I inherited the throne.

[(16:24)](#!):

Paul was even more anti-revolutionary than his mother, and he had spent a lot of time amongst the French emigres, and so when he became Tsar, he tossed aside whatever prudence his mother had been laboring under and decided to make Russia aggressively anti-French. Before the Leoben peace preliminaries were signed in April 1797, Paul offered to mediate between the Austrians and French, but his thumb would have been on this scale the whole time. The French abandoning the left bank of the Rhine would have been a prerequisite to any peace mediated by Paul. When the Austrians signed the Leoben peace preliminaries, the Tsar was incensed that they had given in to French demands, and he started escalating Russia’s involvement in the West.

[(17:07)](#!):

As the Treaty of Campo Formio neared completion in September 1797, Paul declared himself the protector of Malta, one of the few independent islands in the Western Mediterranean. Then in the early months of 1798, Russian spies began to report that the French were massing a huge invasion force in the Mediterranean under General Bonaparte. Where they were headed was of course a mystery, but Tsar Paul and his ministers decided that the French were going to take a stab right at Russia, maybe try to fight their way into Poland and revive the Polish revolutionary cause, which would have been an insane thing for the French to do. Mucking around in Poland brings in Prussia and Austria and Russia all crashing down on their heads simultaneously. But that didn’t stop Paul’s paranoid flights of fancy. So Russian escalation escalated. They were now in close contact with the British, who were naturally urging the Russians to join the fight. And soon enough, Russia had a fleet patrolling the North Sea, which freed up much needed British ships to go beef up their Mediterranean fleet. Then it should come as no surprise to learn that when Bonaparte seized Malta, Tsar Paul took it as practically a declaration of war.

[(18:23)](#!):

And if Bonaparte’s invasion was pushing Russia in the direction of open war, when the destination of the French invasion turned out to be Egypt, that put Russia’s longtime enemy the Ottomans on alert. Now the Ottomans were frankly shocked to discover that they suddenly had something to fear from revolutionary France. So among the amazing accomplishments of Bonaparte’s invasion of Egypt was the creation of something that would have been unthinkable just a few months earlier. A Russo-Turkish alliance.

[(18:55)](#!):

The Russians and Turks were, at that point, about as bitter a pair of enemies as you were going to find anywhere on Earth. And since the middle of the 18th century, Russia had been pretty well beating up on the Turks, most recently in a war that had run from 1787 to 1792. Basically since the mid-1700s, Russia has been expanding at the Ottoman Empire’s expense. The Turks and the French, meanwhile, had always gotten along fine. I mean, yeah, the French Republic was in every way the polar opposite of the Ottoman Sultanate, but they were quite a ways away from each other, and the French and Turks had been trading partners and diplomatically friendly for as long as anyone could remember. So even as the French were cutting off the king’s head and beheading the entire aristocracy or so the stories went, the Turks were still inviting French military advisors and engineers to come over and help them modernize their empire.

[(19:49)](#!):

The first hint that France might be a danger to the Ottomans was when Bonaparte extracted all the Ionian islands that had once belonged to the Venetians. That put France right at the Ottoman Empire’s doorstep. And then they were shocked to find that that fleet massing in Toulon was on its way to Egypt. I mean, sure, Egypt is one of the more independent regions of our empire. But still, you know, hey, that’s ours. What are you doing? To say nothing of the fact that Istanbul was fed by Egyptian grain. The Turkish capital was hit hard by the French invasion of the Nile Delta.

[(20:25)](#!):

But at first there seemed little they could do about it. They were no match for the French on their own, and massing an army to go to Egypt might leave the rest of their territories under garrisoned. Yes, the Ottoman Empire was big, but that did not mean everyone was happy to be a part of it. But Nelson’s smashing victory at Abakir Bay changed the whole equation. Suddenly Bonaparte’s expedition was not this ultra-modern powerhouse that couldn’t be stopped. It was a stranded and unsupported orphan trapped in a foreign land.

[(20:56)](#!):

The British now ruled the Mediterranean Sea, and the Russians were saying, hey, we need to set aside our differences and do something about what Paul I was calling the frenzied French Republic. And so that was how the Ottomans got into it, and why they wound up sending armies into Egypt, as we saw at the end of last week’s show. So at the end of 1798, the craziest thing of all happened.

[(21:18)](#!):

The Russian fleet in the Black Sea was allowed to sail through the Bosphorus and into the Mediterranean to undertake a joint mission with the Turks to expel the French from all those islands in the Ionian Sea. I mean seriously, just six months earlier, the thought of the Turks inviting the Russians to sail on through past Istanbul would have been unthinkable. But the Russians just waved as they sailed by, on their way to fight their now mutual enemy, the French.

[(21:48)](#!):

Meanwhile back in France, the French were well aware that Europe was mobilizing against them. So to get going on their own mobilization, the on-again, off-again General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, now a delegate in the Council of Five Hundred, introduced in early September 1798 a new conscription law that would soon bear his name. The Jourdan Law prescribed compulsory military service for all unmarried men ages 20 to 25.

[(22:17)](#!):

These young men were supposed to register according to their birth dates, and if the government elected to activate the draft, they would be taken in cohorts from youngest to oldest. And wouldn’t you know it, just a few weeks later, September 24th to be exact, the government activated the draft. But as usual, conscription proved to be very tough.

[(22:38)](#!):

The initial levy was set at $203,000. But as the men came forward, nearly $60,000 were deemed medically unfit for service. The process of determining fitness for service was left to local administrators, who made a habit of exempting friends and relatives, neighbors, or anyone with a spare bit of cash.

[(23:00)](#!):

And of the $143,000 deemed fit for service, only $97,000 actually showed up on the day that they were told to show up, and of those $97,000, about $25,000 deserted on the trip between their hometowns and the front lines. So of the 200,000 men who were supposed to be reinforcing the armies along the Rhine and in Italy, only about $74,000 actually made it by the spring of 1799.

[(23:27)](#!):

And just to jump ahead a little bit here, these conscription issues were terribly alarming for the Directory, because by the spring of 1799, war will have been officially declared. So in April 1799, the Directory is going to alter the Jourdan law to allow for replacements to be purchased and volunteers to take the place of those drafted. This new system was supposed to raise another 75,000 men, but only 57,000 actually reached the front.

[(23:55)](#!):

Now these issues have two major impacts on the future of France. First, France is about to get pushed around in the campaigns of 1799. And second, it would further cement the professionalization of the French armies. The great patriotic amateurs who enthusiastically volunteered for the revolutionary armies of old now gave way to men who made the army their career, their way of life, and their home. This widened the chasm between civilian and soldier that helped make Bonaparte’s empire possible.

[(24:28)](#!):

Nowhere was the Jourdan law more despised than in Belgium, where the locals would be subject to French conscription for the first time. As I mentioned a few episodes back, this basically meant that Belgium in the fall of 1798 is the Vend\xc3\xa9e in the spring of 1793. The local peasants are already mad about revolutionary attacks on their traditional church and native aristocracy, and now they are infuriated that Paris is planning to draft them to go fight and die for the very men who exploited them.

[(24:59)](#!):

So the minute officials came round to start registering Belgians for the draft, riots broke out. And these riots soon led to a full-blown peasant uprising in October 1798 that not only tied up badly needed French resources as the Directory tried to pacify the region, but it also helped convince the burgeoning Second Coalition that the French Republic’s hold on the territories it had acquired since 1795 was very, very weak.

[(25:25)](#!):

The British and Russians, for example, were soon deep in talks about a joint invasion of the Netherlands to expel the French occupation. But that would not be enough to help the Belgians currently in revolt. None of them had any experience or training or weapons to keep their uprising going for very long. So though the Belgian countryside raged, by December 1798 the French army had the region mostly back under control. So as 1798 came to an end, it was pretty clear to everyone that, come the spring, war would resume. But still, the Austrians were not necessarily eager to get back into it. I mean, really. Though Tsar Paul was promising a huge army, that, for the moment, was still just talk. The British were, as always, interested only in their own interests, and all anyone could get out of the Prussians was a pledge of neutrality. Which was nice. But the still-as-of-yet unofficial Second Coalition was not exactly the most stable thing on Earth. The Austrians had no desire to get caught fighting the French alone again, so they were not eager to pull the trigger on anything just yet.

[(26:38)](#!):

And that is when the Kingdom of Naples forced everyone’s hand. Encouraged by the British, and with extravagant promises of support from the Russians, the still-independent Kingdom of Naples that controlled the deep south of Italy decided that the French position in Italy was weak, and that the Neapolitan army could boot the French out of Rome, and then roll up the peninsula and squeeze the French out of Italy altogether like some giant tube of toothpaste.

[(27:05)](#!):

The Austrians had told the Neapolitans bluntly to not do anything to provoke the French without Austrian approval, but the Neapolitans just ignored them. On November 12, 1798, a Neapolitan army crossed the border with the new Roman Republic. This attack caught the French general running Rome, a guy named Jean-\xc3\x89tienne Championnet, by surprise, and he had to scramble to get his garrison out of the city before it was trapped. The Neapolitans occupied Rome on November 26, but this occupation would be extremely short-lived.

[(27:39)](#!):

Championnet regrouped and reinforced his army, and then came storming back into Rome, pushing the Neapolitans right back out the door they had come in. And then Championnet just kept going. Pretty soon, he had chased the army all the way back to Naples, blew through whatever part of it hadn’t run off, and then just occupied Naples. The Neapolitans begged the Austrians for help, but Austria said, no, we told you not to do anything, we are not coming to help you.

[(28:08)](#!):

And then up further north, the French used the Neapolitan attack as an excuse to go re-invade the Piedmont and occupy it rather than letting it just live on as a defeated but still independent kingdom. Then in January 1799, General Championnet abolished the kingdom of Naples and declared it to now be the Parthenopean Republic. This was in defiance of an order from the Directory to not form any new sister republics. We have enough on our plate as it is. But Championnet fancied himself the next Bonaparte, and so went ahead and did it anyway.

[(28:43)](#!):

The establish of the Parthenopean Republic put Championnet at loggerheads with the Directory’s representative, who was dispatched to Naples to supervise the occupation. The Directory wanted to break this precedent of the army creating new political units, and so the representative immediately claimed jurisdiction over all land, spoils, and money that the French were seizing. Championnet, of course, was having none of this, and expelled the representative from Naples by force.

[(29:12)](#!):

Unsure of who was actually to blame for this drama, the Directory recalled both men, but then quickly decided General Championnet was absolutely to blame, relieved him of command, and court-martialed him. It was time to bring the army to heel, they thought. Either that or get toppled by them by the end of the year. You know, whichever.

[(29:34)](#!):

Aside from the creation of the Parthenopean Republic, the misadventure of the Neapolitans put enormous pressure on Austria to finally make a decision about whether or not to go back to war. The Russian ambassadors were giving Vienna an earful about not leaping to the aid of Naples. They were now saying either start mobilizing for a coming war or we will not send our armies over and you’ll be left to face a clearly aggressive France all by yourself.

[(30:01)](#!):

Then when the French found out that the Austrians were in fact letting Russian troops enter Habsburg territory, French ambassadors started giving Vienna an earful, they said expel the Russians from your territory or we will declare war. Stuck in the middle, the Austrians finally decided to side with the Russians. The Russians would not be expelled, and if that meant war with France, then so be it.

[(30:25)](#!):

But on the eve of the war, the Second Coalition did not have a clear objective, nor even similar objectives. The Russians were looking to be an ascendant power in Europe, in Italy for sure, probably Greece eventually too. This was of course unacceptable to all their partners. The Ottomans didn’t want them in Greece, the Austrians and British really didn’t want them in Italy. Meanwhile, the British wanted the Netherlands back badly, but no one else really cared about that. And the only other thing the British wanted was some kind of stable balance of power on the continent. So if the British decided one of their new partners was getting too far out in front of the rest, you could pretty well bank on the British doing something to block them.

[(31:08)](#!):

The Ottomans meanwhile just wanted to get the French out of Egypt and the Russians off their backs. Once the French were expelled from Egypt, who knows how committed the Turks would be to further anti-French action. And as for the Austrians, the Austrians didn’t really know what they wanted, just to roll back the French I guess, restabilize their fracturing Holy Roman Empire.

[(31:31)](#!):

The French Directory meanwhile was stuck between its ambitions and the realities of their situation. General Jourdan had gone back to the German frontier in November 1798, surveyed the situation, and wrote back extremely pessimistic reports about the preparedness of the armies stationed along the Rhine and Danube frontiers. Most of the best men and supplies had either been diverted up to the men still camped along the English Channel, or had sailed away with Bonaparte. Jourdan asked the Directory for more supplies\xe2\x80\x94reinforcements, guns, shoes, blankets, anything, everything\xe2\x80\x94but he got almost none of it. Because the Directory A. did not have much to spare, and B. they were in a bit of a bubble when it came to how vulnerable they really were. The map of Europe clearly showed them controlling a string of sister republics with large armies stationed everywhere. But that was all on paper.

[(32:25)](#!):

In reality, Jourdan was right. If the Austrians and Russians decided to, say, strike at Italy or up into Switzerland, he was going to have a heck of a time fighting them off. But the Directory was unconcerned with such dour predictions. Using the pretext of the Russians crossing the Austrian frontier, the Directory declared war on March 12, 1799, and the war of the Second Coalition had begun.

[(32:53)](#!):

Next week, we will begin with a string of French defeats in Italy and Germany and Switzerland that threaten to undo everything the French had achieved since 1795. Then we will head back to Paris for yet another political coup, a coup that will help set up the final coup of Brumaire that will end the Directory once and for all. And of course, we will also see Napoleon Bonaparte return home to save France. And maybe while he was at it, seize control of France, and then go conquer all of Europe.

Hello and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.51, The Coup of Prairial.

[(02:02)](#!):

So this week marks the penultimate episode of our cycle on the French Revolution. It will take us through to the autumn of 1799 and set up the looming coup of Brumaire that out of some necessity I am marking as the end of the line. After next week’s episode brings Bonaparte to power, we will wrap up completely with a final episode two weeks from now that looks back on the French Revolution and forward into the Napoleonic era to try to make some sense of the incredibly complicated decade we’ve been immersed in for more than 50 episodes. And since I’m already talking about general show business, I should also mention that I finally decided to reactivate my Twitter account. I actually joined way back in March 2007, decided this weird new social messaging platform was not really going to be a thing, and just never used it. But I’m using it now. As a consequence of signing up so early, though, I am actually just Mike Duncan. That’s it. At Mike Duncan. Apparently, I was the first Mike Duncan to ever sign up for Twitter. So come find me at Mike Duncan. I’m there now. It’s mostly history, baseball, and a smattering of snarky remarks about current events. It’ll also be a nice way to keep in touch when I go dark for two months, which I will be doing in just a few weeks.

Okay, enough of that. On with the show. We left off last time with the Directory declaring war on Austria in March 1799, which officially started the War of the Second Coalition.

[(03:31)](#!):

Despite the Russians and Ottomans now joining the British and Austrians, the Directory felt pretty good about its chances. They had gotten used to beating up on the old European powers, and didn’t think 1799 would be any different. This, despite General Jourdan’s repeated warnings over the winter that the army set to defend Italy, Switzerland, and the Rhineland, were not in very good shape. They were both undermanned and undersupplied, and the situation had not at all improved by the spring. Remember, 200,000 men were supposed to have reinforced the frontiers, but only 74,000 actually made it to the front.

[(04:09)](#!):

For the campaigns of 1799, the French had organized a new army 45,000 strong that they called the Army of the Danube, and put it under the incredibly nervous General Jourdan. Down in Italy, there were close to 100,000 French troops, but they were scattered all over the peninsula. But in anticipation of the coming hostilities, about 45,000 were concentrated along the Adige River, that is, the border between the Cisalpine Republic and now Austrian Venice.

[(04:40)](#!):

A raid against the French in the spring of 1799 were about 75,000 Austrians in southern Germany under Archduke Charles, 60,000 down on the other side of the Adige in Venice, and another 20,000 guarding the Alpine passes in and out of Austrian territory. Now the new key ingredient to the year’s campaign would of course be the looming arrival of the Russians. Tsar Paul had pledged 60,000 men to fight the frenzied French Republic, and he was making good on his pledge. These Russian troops had been massing in Austrian territory all winter, and were preparing to move into Italy and Switzerland.

[(05:17)](#!):

One of the Austrian conditions for joining forces with the Russians was that the Russians send the legendary General Alexander Suvorov to serve as Commander in Chief. Suvorov was by now pushing 70 years old, but over the course of his life, he had led troops in more than 60 major battles and had never been defeated. Not once. He was, by 1799, an almost mythical legend in his own time. And age apparently had not diminished his skills. He was soon pushing the French out of Italy, and undoing all of Bonaparte’s conquests.

[(05:52)](#!):

The Directory decided it was best to strike first, before the Russians could get into the fight, and so in early March 1799, they ordered Jordan to take the army of the Danube across the Rhine at a crossing near Basel, just where the river starts to turn east. The plan was for them to attack Austrian positions on the Swiss Plateau, which is basically the land between the Rhine River to the south and the Danube to the north. The objective of the offensive was to win firm control of all the Alpine passes between Germany and Italy.

[(06:22)](#!):

Germany and Italy were bound to be the two main theaters of the war, and the French wanted to make sure that their enemies fought in isolation from each other. And with the Swiss Helvetic Republic garrisoned by another 20,000 French soldiers, it looked like a pretty good bet on paper that the strategic central position would be held by the French.

[(06:41)](#!):

But things did not go well for Jordan, as was usually the case when he crossed the Rhine. If this were ancient times, a legend of an old wise woman predicting that Jordan could never win beyond the Rhine would have already been written into his biography. Like the old Roman superstition that only Scipios can win in North Africa, only in reverse. Jordan advanced 35,000 men northeast out of Basel onto the plains of Ostra, on the north edge of the Swiss Plateau, which he thought was a highly advantageous position. But when he got there, the plains turned out to be overly soggy and thick with early spring fog. Not only did the ground make it hard to maneuver, but the fog shrouded the size of Archduke Charles’ army. Jordan did not realize 52,000 Austrians were coming to meet him, with another 25,000 in close reserve.

[(07:32)](#!):

The two armies met on March the 20th, and the Austrians’ unexpected numerical advantage proved decisive. Jordan and his army retreated up to some high ground and planned a counterattack, but the next day the fog lifted, and Jordan got his first look at how much bigger the Austrian army really was. Having already taken heavy casualties the day before, Jordan withdrew west. A few days later, on March the 25th, the Austrians caught up with the French at Stuka. Jordan tried to tighten up his lines to take advantage of the spread out Austrians, and the French nearly flanked their enemy. But the attempt failed, and Jordan had to pull back again, this time northwest into the Black Forest.

[(08:12)](#!):

But though he had Jordan on the run, Archduke Charles did not pursue the French any further. Instead he called a halt to wait for the Russians so they could all turn and expel the French from Switzerland. Bonaparte was later critical of Jordan, both for some tactical decisions he had made during the Battle of Stuka, but more importantly for retreating into the Black Forest rather than pulling back up into Switzerland to join with the 20,000 men garrisoning the Helvetic Republic. This decision divided the French forces and all but made the defense of Switzerland impossible.

[(08:45)](#!):

Jordan himself then returned to Paris to complain about the terribly unprepared army the Directory had sent him off with, requested medical leave because he was sick, which the Directory, sick of his complaints, promptly granted.

[(08:58)](#!):

Meanwhile down in Italy, things were about to go no better. The Army of Italy was now led by a guy named General Scherer, an old professional soldier who had served in both the Austrian and Dutch armies before the Revolution, but who had been a mainstay of the French army ever since. Now I didn’t mention it at the time, but Scherer was actually the guy Bonaparte replaced as commander of the Army of Italy back in 1796. Scherer had then been appointed Minister of War during the great ministerial reshuffle that also brought Talleyrand to power during the build-up to the coup of Fructidor, and as the war of the Second Coalition approached, Scherer was sent back to take control of the Army of Italy, where he would prove himself to be no Bonaparte, and soon enough General Scherer too would be requesting somebody else take over his army.

[(09:48)](#!):

The boundary between the French-controlled Cisalpine Republic and the Austrian-controlled Venetian Republic was essentially the Adige River, though the Austrians did control a few of the cities on the west bank of the river, the most important of those being Verona. So just as Jourdan had tried to jump the Austrians before the Russians arrived, so too did General Scherer. In mid-March 1799, he advanced east with 46,000 men with the intention of first expelling the Austrians from Verona, then taking full control of the Adige, and then using that as a base to advance still further east. But he never even got past step one, and in fact he was soon in step negative one, retreating back towards the west in a demoralized rush.

[(10:34)](#!):

Scherer advanced east in three columns. His left and right columns attacked the cities of Pastrengo and Lignano, while his center drove straight at Verona. The cities were all held by a combined Austrian army of about 41,000. On March 26th, the French engaged on all three fronts. They took Pastrengo, were repulsed and driven back at Lignano, and fought to a bloody draw at Verona itself. This inconclusive first round of fighting, though, was just a prelude to the more disastrous second round.

[(11:07)](#!):

On April 5th, the French massed south of Verona and marched north towards the city, just as the Austrians were marching south out of the city to meet them. The two armies ran into each other in a driving rainstorm at the small town of Lignano on April 5th. In the resulting battle, Scherer deployed his forces along a wide front, and his right wing nearly succeeded in turning the Austrian left. But by then he was too spread out, he had not held back sufficient reserves to plug up holes or reinforce trouble spots, and as a result the Austrians were able to cut off that advancing French right from their comrades.

[(11:43)](#!):

With his army now fatally divided, Scherer ordered a general retreat. But instead of drawing up his forces at the next defensible river, Scherer pulled back all the way to the Ada River, that is nearly all the way back to Milan, just giving up about a hundred miles worth of territory, and leaving a bunch of French garrisons holding various cities basically to fend for themselves, including that all-important fortress of Mantua, which was being held by 12,000 Frenchmen and which was immediately put to siege.

[(12:14)](#!):

The run of defeats apparently convinced General Scherer himself that he was in way over his head. Having lost all confidence in his own ability to salvage the situation, he turned the Army of Italy over to Major General Moreau, the far more capable general who we last saw charging headlong across the Rhine and Danube and then back again during the Rhine campaign of 1796. But though Scherer lost mostly because he was not a very good general, back in Paris there were deep suspicions that he had turned traitor and was just letting the Austrians win. After taking over the Army of Italy, Moreau drew up a heavy defensive position along the Ada River to protect Milan, the capital of the Cisalpine Republic and most pro-French of all the Italian cities. He had 28,000 concentrated at Cassano, and that is where the Austrians hit, except now they were more than just the Austrians because the Russians had finally started to arrive.

[(13:12)](#!):

General Suvorov personally led the advanced Russian units who met up with the Austrians for a push on Milan. Assuming overall command of the now allied army, Suvorov and a combined force of 24,000 Austrians and Russians attacked Moreau at Cassano on April the 27th, and after a hard day’s fighting they pushed the French out. Moreau then broke off 2,400 men to go take the citadel of Milan and try to hold onto it while he himself led the main army in a retreat further west. Suvorov then led the allied army into Milan on April the 29th.

[(13:48)](#!):

But he did not stay there long. Just two weeks later Suvorov got the allied army moving west again, pushing up the Po River into the Piedmont where he planned to expel the French from Turin and restore the kingdom of Sardinia. Moreau tried to block Suvorov at Marengo, but he was beaten again because Suvorov doesn’t lose. On May the 26th the allies entered Turin and Moreau pulled south towards Genoa to regroup. So in the spring of 1799 the French are just getting whipped on all fronts.

[(14:22)](#!):

Fortunately for the directorial regime back in Paris, the initial offensives of the war were launched just as the elections for year seven were getting underway. And I mean that seriously. The defeats on the Swiss plateau and in Italy were not yet known to the voters. Unfortunately for the directory this didn’t really matter. The men who showed up to the primary assemblies to vote were decidedly anti-regime anyway. Win or lose it’s safe to say that most people in France were not at all thrilled about the resumption of war. To most French families the return of war meant only tax increases, forced requisitioning, and conscription of their sons.

[(15:00)](#!):

But inside the electoral assemblies themselves, most of the anger at the Directory was not that they had restarted the war, but rather that they were not sufficiently prepared to win it. Old French supernationalists of the early Jacobin or even Girondin variety were perfectly happy with the Directory’s aggressive posturing, but were incensed that they were not doing a better job mobilizing to win. So once again, the regime was facing certain defeat at the polls. Of 187 candidates running who were endorsed one way or the other by the sitting directorial regime, 121 were defeated, mostly by men of the neo-Jakobin variety.

[(15:41)](#!):

So it’s time for another coup, right? Well yes, but not the kind of coup you might be expecting given the pattern of coups that we’ve seen over the last few episodes. The Directory attempted to employ the same bag of tricks for the elections of year seven that they had used to control the elections of year six\xe2\x80\x94that is, agents stirring up fake controversies, electing totally contrived alternative candidate slates, and inventing schisms in the primary assemblies. And as always, railing against the imaginary anarchist royalist conspiracy that these left-wing candidates wore the white cockade of royalism under the red cap of liberty.

[(16:20)](#!):

But this time, the legislative councils were less interested in backing the directors up. Rather than invalidating anti-regime candidates, the councils confirmed their election and let them take their seats in the councils. This spelled big trouble for the triumvirate of Rubel, La Revelliere, and Barras, who had controlled the so-called Second Directory ever since the coup of Fructidor. But though this was troubling, in the end it would be okay. Because as we discussed during the episode on Fructidor, the Directory had one major ally they could always count on\xe2\x80\x94the army.

[(16:56)](#!):

As long as the army was with them, they were safe. But of course, this is the moment the army is getting beat by the Austrians and Russians on all fronts, and the generals are only too happy to scapegoat the directors for leaving the French armies ill-prepared for the war. The scope of the French defeats were becoming known just as the new session of the legislative councils convened at the end of May 1799. The neo-Jacobean opposition was soon in very productive talks with the generals about overthrowing the triumvirate.

[(17:29)](#!):

The news only got worse on the frontier during the opening weeks of the legislative session. With the Russians now officially in the war, the Austrian High Command ordered Archduke Charles to move on French positions in Switzerland. The Directory had already more or less disbanded the Army of the Danube to face this new strategic situation, and the Army of Switzerland had now been bulked up to about 52,000 men\xe2\x80\x94a combined force of French soldiers and Swiss conscripts.

[(17:57)](#!):

This army was also led by the truly excellent General Andre Massena, who I wish I had been able to spend more time on, because he is truly a cut above the rest. He was a key general of division during Bonaparte’s Italian campaigns, and then will become one of Napoleon’s original marshals of France, and clearly one of the two or three best of the lot. Massena drew up a defensive line in front of Zurich, but he was about to be overwhelmed by two Austrian armies. He sent out a strong force to try to prevent the two from linking up, but the attempt failed, and on June the 4th, the Austrians launched an attack on Massena’s defensive line on multiple fronts. But all through the first day’s fighting, the French repelled the initial attack, and the next day both sides regrouped. Massena pulled in even closer to Zurich, but he did not like where this was headed. Austrian envoys came to parlay on June the 6th, and Massena said he would withdraw from Zurich if the Allies would just let him go. Archduke Charles agreed, and the French abandoned Zurich.

[(19:04)](#!):

Just after Massena pulled out of Zurich, Suvorov then delivered a crushing defeat of the French in Italy. With the situation in northern Italy going so horribly, the French forces in southern Italy were ordered to mobilize and all but evacuate the south to come help salvage the situation in the north.

[(19:24)](#!):

But instead, the so-called Army of Naples that was soon on the way would practically guarantee the French expulsion from Italy. Suvorov was well aware that he could not allow the Army of Naples to link up with the Army of Italy, so he made a bold decision to concentrate all his efforts on the Army of Naples. The French forces from the south tried to swing around the Allies through the Apennine Mountains rather than coming up the much safer west coast road, and Suvorov took full advantage of the mistake.

[(19:54)](#!):

On June the 18th, Suvorov met the Army of Naples at the Trebia River, a southern tributary of the Po that you all may recall as the site of one of Hannibal’s greatest victories. Remember when the Romans rushed off and got beat because they skipped breakfast? Same place. On the first day of fighting, Suvorov’s army of about 35,000, now an equal mix of Russians and Austrians, attacked the French line but were repulsed. The second day unfolded in reverse. The Army of Naples attacked but were themselves repulsed. But now the French were taking heavy, heavy losses, and the defeat on day two was crushing. They fell into a demoralized retreat on the third day.

[(20:36)](#!):

The total numbers are disputed, but of the 35,000 or so who left Naples, something like 12,000 to 15,000 wound up battle casualties, either killed, captured, or wounded. Suvorov was set to pursue, but when he grasped the scope of the French losses he had inflicted, he determined that the Army of Naples was just not a threat anymore.

[(20:57)](#!):

The rump of the defeated French army marched towards the west coast of Italy, where Moreau was trying to regroup north of Genoa. In just about three months disastrous campaigning, the situation in northern Italy was practically back to where it had been before Bonaparte showed up, the French contained down along the crest of the Ligurian Alps, and the Allies holding everything else. The only difference was that the French, for the time being, still had garrisons holding a patchwork of citadels in what had now become deep enemy territory, all of which were now under siege.

[(21:33)](#!):

With the defeats mounting, and Moreau on the way, the political situation in Paris grew dire for the Triumvirate running the Directory, though it could hardly be called the Triumvirate anymore. The opportunistic wildcard Paul Barra already had one foot out the door. He looked around, and became convinced that the only way to survive whatever was coming next was to switch sides.

[(21:55)](#!):

Then either fate, or some very sneaky behind-the-scenes maneuvering, stepped in to make the death of the Triumvirate official. Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Rubel had his name drawn from the magical retirement hat. Probably the most consistently driven and intelligent of the directors, Rubel’s forced retirement left a vacuum bigger than just one vacant seat. It changed the entire political balance inside the Directory. And doubly so, because the man the Council selected to take Rubel’s seat was Emmanuel Joseph C.S., the man who had refused to join the original class of directors in 1795 because he hated the Directory so, so much. And you can see where this is all going.

[(22:38)](#!):

C.S. has had an interesting career since he wrote What is the Third Estate? way back in episode 3.9. If you’ll recall from way back when, he was one of the main drivers between the push to create a unified National Assembly after the Estates General had convened. He then sat on the Constitutional Committee, because constitutions were his passion. But his influence was undermined when he came out against some of the major church reforms. C.S. did not want to abolish tithes, and he opposed the civil constitution of the clergy.

[(23:09)](#!):

But he bounced back in 1792 and got elected into the National Convention. And despite his sincere belief in a constitutional monarchy, he sat on the Convention’s first version of the Constitutional Committee that was supposed to be drawing up the first republican constitution for France. But that original committee was the Girondin version of the committee. And after the Mountain took control of the National Convention, C.S. was forever suspect. Hoping to avoid the fate of so many of his friends and colleagues from the good old days of 1789, he renounced his faith during the great de-Christianization run over the winter 1793-1794 that we talked about in episode 3.35. It was not until Termidor that C.S. could finally relax. When he was asked later what he did during the terror, C.S. famously replied, I lived. After Termidor, he returned to public life and had been a lead negotiator in the Treaty of the Hague that set up the Batavian Republic. And having regained his reputation and his prestige, he had tried to play a major role in the crafting of the Constitution of Year 3 that created the Directory, but almost all his suggestions were ignored. Bitter over the slight, he refused to serve as one of the five original directors, despite being elected. But when the legislative councils tapped him to be a director in 1799, he agreed to serve. His opinion of the Constitution had not changed, mind you. He just figured now was a pretty good time to get in and bring the whole thing crashing down. C.S. had lately been serving as ambassador to Prussian, so it was not until June 9th that he returned to Paris from Berlin. After that, events moved very quickly. So quickly, in fact, that it is nigh impossible to believe that a lot of what comes next hadn’t been worked out in advance. Paul Barra, for example, had played a major role in getting C.S. elected into the Directory, and the two of them are about to team up to purge all the other directors and form a whole new government.

[(25:11)](#!):

So just to remind you who the five directors actually are at this point, we have, first of all, La Raveliere, the remaining staunch triumvir who’s been in the Directory since day one. Then we have Paul Barra, also a director from day one, who is right now in the process of abandoning La Raveliere to his fate. The two other members who you’ve probably forgotten all about were Philippe-Antoine Merlot de Douy, who was appointed in the wake of the Fructidor coup, and Jean-Baptiste Traher, who was the guy who had served as the belligerent French ambassador at the opening of the Congress of Ristat, and who had been elected director in the wake of the coup of Florian.

[(25:51)](#!):

The newest member was, of course, C.S., who has just taken Rubel’s seat. You got all that? Good. Everyone not named C.S. or Barra is about to get the boot. Just before C.S. arrived in Paris, the Council of Five Hundred demanded the Directory produce a full report on the military situation. Who was supplying the army? Where was all the money going? How had conscription been proceeding? Why were the armies getting beat so badly?

[(26:21)](#!):

The assumption here was that there was so much graft and war profiteering and corruption going on that any report on army logistics was sure to fatally compromise the directors. The Council of Five Hundred was still waiting for this report on June 16, 1799, aka 28 Prairial year 7, and so they declared themselves in permanent session until the Directory accounted for itself. The Council of Ancients followed their lead, and the coup of Prairial was on.

[(26:52)](#!):

Late that same night, after all the Directory’s friends had gone to bed, anti-regime delegates opened up a full broadside. Their first target was Jean-Baptiste Treyar. The Council of Five Hundred declared that there were irregularities with Treyar’s election and demanded he be expelled from the Directory at once. The Council of Ancients concurred. When the demand landed on the Directory’s desk, La Raveli\xc3\xa8re said, we are obviously not going to comply with this, right guys? Which is when Barra and Sies said, oh no, I think we should. Which is when La Raveli\xc3\xa8re realized that Barra had abandoned the political alliance that had defined the Directory for the last two years.

[(27:33)](#!):

Feeling isolated, not a little bit afraid for his personal safety if things got ugly, Treyar agreed to resign. He was replaced by Louis-Germain Goyer, an old Jackman who had been Minister of Justice from March 1793 until March 1794, that is, during the height of the Reign of Terror. The very next day, 30 prairie all on the Republican calendar and June 18, 1799 to you and me, the Council of Five Hundred then turned on La Raveli\xc3\xa8re and Merlot de Douy, accusing them of corruption and misappropriation of state funds and treasonous mismanagement of the war, the Councils demanded their immediate resignation.

[(28:13)](#!):

Now both of the directors initially resisted this call, but a parade of delegates convinced them that it was best to resign, I mean, no one wants bloodshed, right? Merlot cracked first and tendered his resignation, La Raveli\xc3\xa8re followed shortly thereafter. Barra and Sies then suggested worthy replacements, and wouldn’t you know it, the Councils agreed with their choices. The new directors were Pierre Roger Ducault, an old regicide from the National Convention, and an obscure Jacobinish general named Jean-Fran\xc3\xa7ois Moulin.

[(28:48)](#!):

With the replacement of the three directors, the coup of prairie all was not only complete, but it looked like a total victory for the left. Was a new revolutionary government on the way?

[(29:01)](#!):

For a while, it sure looked like it. Right away, for example, the reshuffled directory reshuffled the entire ministerial cabinet, purging the allegedly corrupt triumvirate men, including Talleyrand, who loses his job as foreign minister, and putting men sympathetic to Jacobinism in their place, including General Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, an accomplished and quite enlightened general who would go on to have a famously stormy relationship with Napoleon. Like Massana, Bernadotte would become one of the original marshals of France, and then wind up King of Sweden in 1810, eventually allying Sweden against Napoleon. The royal family of Sweden today is descended from Bernadotte. He’s a fascinating guy, but his story is beyond the scope of our show.

[(29:50)](#!):

The newly left-leaning legislative councils then proceeded to reinstate freedom of the press, which had been scotched after the coup of Fructidor. They also lifted the ban on political clubs, which soon led to the formation of yet another neo-Jacobin club, called the Menege Club, because it took up residence in the Menege of the Tuileries Palace, which had served as the home of the National Assembly, the Legislative Assembly, and the National Convention, but which had been vacated since right around the time the Committee of Public Safety started chopping everyone’s head off in early 1794.

[(30:23)](#!):

Looking back through the transcripts, I can see that I never mentioned that the convention moved out of the drafty Menege in early 1794, and I apologize for skipping that part. Those were complicated times.

[(30:36)](#!):

So then at the end of June, once news of the loss of Zurich and the crushing defeat of the Army of Naples had come in, General Jourdan, now in slightly better health and once again taking his seat in the Council of 500, proposed that a new lev\xc3\xa9e en masse be declared. All eligible conscripts for the Army would be called up simultaneously. The economy of France would once again be wholly dedicated to the war effort. Aggressive domestic requisitioning would commence at once, as would a new round of forced loans on the rich. The high point of the neo-Jacobin ascendancy came in July 1799, when the councils passed the Law of Hostages.

[(31:17)](#!):

The law said that if the government declared a department disturbed by domestic unrest, that family members of the men deemed responsible could be arrested and held as hostages. Those families would also be held liable for any damages caused by civil unrest. The Law of Hostages was directed almost entirely against the families of emigres and other nobles. So this is all starting to look like we are in fact going back to the left-wing Jacobin nationalism of 1793.

[(31:49)](#!):

Then the leftists in the Council of 500 decided that merely purging the old directors would not be enough. On July 14, 1799, the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, and the day Bonaparte whipped the Turks outside of Alexandria, the councils indicted for corruption and treason, Rubel, L’Or\xc3\xa9valier, Merlot de Douy, Tr\xc3\xa9art, and the suspect General Shearer.

[(32:15)](#!):

But this was all now swinging in a direction that CS and Barras did not like. So while the indictments were debated through the summer, they organized a reaction. The zenith of the neo-Jacobins at home coincided with the nadir of the army’s fortunes abroad.

[(32:33)](#!):

With the French field armies in Italy broken and bottled up in Liguria, every French-held citadel and fortress on the peninsula just started capitulating one after the other. The Milan garrison surrendered on May 24, the Turin garrison gave up on June 20, and when the army of Naples departed for the north, the small garrison left in Naples, fell under immediate attack, and surrendered on June 15.

[(32:57)](#!):

And those were just the main cities. All the men holding all those little Italian forts everywhere saw no sense in holding out. And then came the ultimate kicker. After a four-month siege, Mantua fell at the end of July. Bonaparte’s work was completely undone.

[(33:16)](#!):

The army of Italy attempted to reverse the situation in mid-August. With Merlot having failed to salvage the situation, he too was replaced by a guy named Barthelemy Catherine Joubert, a 30-year-old general of immense talent who had been elevated rapidly by Bonaparte during the campaigns of 1796-1797. Joubert had about 35,000 men at his disposal, and he arrayed them around the city of Novi up in some high ground that looked down on the Piedmont and guarded the entrances into the Ligurian Alps. This was all near where Bonaparte had begun his spectacular campaigns. Joubert planned to strike out from this position and win back what had been lost. And he did not really expect Suvorov to come down and attack him. But then suddenly on August 15, that’s exactly what Suvorov did with more than 50,000 men. The French managed to hold out all day against successive waves of Russians and Austrians in an incredibly bloody fight. But as night fell, the French lines finally began to crack up. Joubert’s army was split in two, and they fell into a fighting bloody retreat south through the mountains towards the coast of the Ligurian Republic, their very last toehold in Italy. Joubert himself, one of the best and most promising of the young French generals, was killed in the battle.

[(34:38)](#!):

Suvorov set to work planning the final eviction of the French from Italy, when he received frustrating new orders. The Austrian high command had decided not to pursue the French army of Italy any further until Switzerland was firmly in Allied hands. They ordered Suvorov to turn his back on Liguria and march north into Switzerland. This would prove to be a fatal blunder, as it would set up the complete reversal of Allied fortunes in the fall of 1799, reversals that would end with the Russians and Austrians as ready to kill each other as they were ready to kill the French.

[(35:15)](#!):

Next week, we will begin with a quick swing across the frontiers, as the seemingly inexorable Allied advance was suddenly turned back. But we don’t want to spend too much time covering those battles, because the fall of 1799 also marks the end of the line for our narrative of the French Revolution. Back in Paris, CS and Barras will organize a response to the ascendant neo-Jacabans that will culminate with the coup of 18 Brumaire that will topple the Directory and pave the way for the Consulate and then the Empire.

[(35:49)](#!):

But as we will see, though Bonaparte was the principal benefactor of the coup of 18 Brumaire, he’s also the one who nearly blew the whole project before it even got off the ground.

[(01:40)](#!):

So we have somehow, amazingly, come to the end of the French Revolution. We’ve been at this together for 14 months, more than 50 episodes, and over 250,000 words of transcript. But today, the directory will be overthrown, and Napoleon Bonaparte will come to power.

[(01:58)](#!):

There are lots of places to date the end of the French Revolution. The coup of Termidor that toppled Robespierre might have actually been a good place to stop. The referendum in 1802 that makes Bonaparte first consul for life is another good candidate. That time Napoleon becomes emperor in 1804. But we are stopping here today with the coup of 18 Brumaire that brings Bonaparte to power for the first time. And we’re just going to go ahead and say that this is the end of the French Revolution.

[(02:29)](#!):

In the late summer of 1799, the French Republic appeared to be facing a crisis not seen since the dark days of 1793. The French armies were losing on all fronts. An invasion of France seemed not just possible, but probable. And on top of that, anger over taxes and conscription was leading to domestic uprisings, uprisings egged on by royalist agitators still trying to bring the republic to its knees. And the response in Paris very much echoed the response to the great crisis of 1793. The neo-Jacobins were on the rise. A de facto lev\xc3\xa9 en masse had been declared. Nobles and emigres faced summary persecution. The central government was hemorrhaging legitimacy. And talk of another great revolutionary insurrection was in the air. But by the end of the year, the Directory would be overthrown, just not by radical revolutionaries, but rather a clique of authoritarians who believed the way forward was not liberty and democracy, but power and order.

[(03:29)](#!):

During the summer, Emmanuel Joseph CS, now the dominant personality in the Directory, was already organizing an effort to nip any nascent left-wing revolutionary uprising in the bud. On July the 20th, 1799, he and his new ally Paul Barra contrived to appoint Joseph Fouchet, minister of police. Fouchet, remember, was one of the leaders of de-Christianization. And he had played a major role in the reign of terror in Lyon, but had by now restyled himself as a Termidorian-style moderate opposed to radical Jacobinism. On August the 13th, the new minister of police decided the Menege Club, that neo-Jacobin club that now boasted some 3,000 members, was a threat to public safety. Fouchet ordered the club first to vacate the Menege and then outlawed it completely a few days later. And then just a few days after that, moderates in the legislative councils tossed out the indictments of the former directors who had been purged during the coup of Prairie Hall.

[(04:30)](#!):

But then events beyond the control of CS and Barra undermined these efforts. In August, Paris would be told that A, anti-conscription peasant uprisings were breaking out. B, General Gilbert had been killed while getting beat by the Russians and Austrians at the Battle of Novi. And C, the British and Russians had invaded the Batavian Republic.

[(04:52)](#!):

Now, we dealt with Gilbert at the end of last week’s episode. So today, we’ll take the first and third of these new threats. The directory had already dealt with a full-blown peasant uprising in Belgium over conscription. And though that uprising had been suppressed, the atmosphere there was still thick with resentment. That’s one of the reasons the British and Russians were about to feel so confident about invading the Netherlands. Through the spring and summer of 1799, resistance to the draft was widespread across France. Royalist agents took notice and decided to exploit it. It goes without saying that in the Western departments, the old Shuon and Catholic and Royal Army networks started to reform and reconnect. Scattered raids and guerrilla ambushes signaled a possible return of civil war in the West.

[(05:39)](#!):

But the hottest bet of resistance in 1799 turned out to be way down in the very Southwest around the city of Toulouse. At the beginning of August, a peasant mob fully 10,000 strong organized and started rampaging around the countryside. Unfortunately for this mob, though, the city of Toulouse itself had always been a fairly strong Jacobin stronghold. And so the city’s far better equipped, trained, and led National Guard units were able to quash the uprising by the end of the month. So within weeks of finding out that an entire department was in revolt, Paris learned that it really wasn’t anymore. But this was good news, bad news for the directorial regime. Putting down peasant revolts is always good news, but it was worrisome that it had been suppressed by enthusiastic left-wing Jacobins. It only added further momentum to a movement the Directory was trying to squelch.

[(06:32)](#!):

But no sooner had this good news, bad news, come in than Paris received really bad news. The Allied victories in Switzerland and Italy had given the Second Coalition an enormous boost of confidence, so much so that the British and Russians had decided to launch a joint invasion of the Batavian Republic. Bringing the Netherlands back into the British sphere of influence was the war aim of the British on the continent. But in the larger strategic attack on France, invading the Netherlands would open up a new front in the war that would prevent the French from effectively reinforcing their armies down around the Alps, and hopefully dealing with spreading domestic unrest.

[(07:14)](#!):

The belief inside the British ministry was that the French occupation of the Netherlands was really unpopular, and that any force they landed would be greeted as liberators. So a deal was struck between Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and Tsar Paul. In exchange for a boatload of British money, the Russians would provide 17,000 troops to augment a British expeditionary force 13,000 to 20,000 strong. Together, they would invade the Batavian Republic and evict the French without breaking a sweat.

[(07:44)](#!):

But as I mentioned back in episode 3.47, though the Dutch were not thrilled with their burdensome alliance with the French, they were not at all interested in welcoming back the British-supported William, Prince of Orange. William had become even more reactionary than the exiled King Louis XVIII, and he was promising to restore the old Orange’s oligarchy in its entirety and exact reprisals on anyone who would help boot him out of his country. But the British didn’t know this, because they were getting their intelligence from Agents of William, Prince of Orange. And they were spinning great whoppers about how ready the Dutch were to rise up against the French and welcome William home.

[(08:22)](#!):

Full of optimism, the British sailed down advanced units towards the port of Den Helder at the end of August. And their initial optimism was reinforced when the Dutch fleet that should have been preventing a landing just sailed out of the way and let the British pass. On August the 27th, 1799, the British established a beachhead. And three days after that, the crews of the Dutch fleet mutinied and defected to the Allies. But the demoralized Dutch sailors, who wanted no part of fighting the British Navy, did not really reflect the general attitude of their countrymen, as the British and Russians would soon discover.

[(08:59)](#!):

Opposing the British was a Dutch army about 20,000 strong, backed up by a French occupation force of about 15,000. That was the army that was supposed to be 25,000. And that’s what the Dutch were paying for, but it’s still only just the 15,000.

[(09:15)](#!):

Not knowing where the British planned to land, these forces were spread out all along the coast. And it took a few days to concentrate once the British put in at Den Helder. But even when they did, they got beat at Krabendam on September the 10th, which paved the way for the Russians to land their half of the Allied army, plus additional British reinforcements. By the second week of September, the combined British and Russian army numbered over 40,000. Back in Paris, this new crisis triggered a showdown between the resurgent neo-Jakubins and the more moderate leaders of the Termidorian variety, who were both appalled and terrified that the left was getting ready to drag France back into the horrors of year two.

[(09:58)](#!):

This battle culminated with a proposal by General Jourdan. Jourdan was deeply annoyed with the Directory for mismanaging the war and constantly sending him out there to lose. And so was now firmly aligned with the neo-Jakubin opposition. On September the 13th, Jourdan rose and proposed that the councils declare the country in danger, just as the legislative assembly had done in July of 1792.

[(10:25)](#!):

If the council so declared, the normal constitution would be suspended and emergency powers would go into effect. The neo-Jakubin said this was an absolutely necessary step if France is going to survive. The old revolutionary spirit must be renewed and nothing could be allowed to stand in the way of that renewed revolutionary spirit. But the moderate center was not at all convinced that this was the case. Emergency powers had been necessary when we didn’t have a stable constitution, they said. But we have one now and we should let it work.

[(10:57)](#!):

Everyone has the authority they need to organize and rally the nation to victory. We just need to let them do their jobs. Plus, in case you’ve somehow forgotten, it was the declaration that the country was in danger that led directly to the insurrection of August the 10th, the September massacres, and eventually the reign of terror. And we do not want to go back to that. When the vote was taken the next day, the memory of all that had been bad about emergency powers outweighed the memory of all that had been good about it. In the Council of 500, the motion was defeated 245 to 171.

[(11:33)](#!):

Then, as luck would have it, the moderates were proven entirely correct. They did not, in fact, need emergency powers to win the war. And just as the spring and summer had brought nothing but bad news from the front, the fall brought nothing but good news.

[(11:50)](#!):

Up in the Netherlands, the British and Russian invasion was already stalling out. Despite their hefty numerical advantage, or perhaps because of it, the British and Russians were having trouble collaborating with each other. They were sweeping south across a wide front, but not showing particularly strong discipline or coordination. On top of that, large parts of the countryside were starting to flood, and supply lines became treacherous, washed out, or impassable. And of course, the kicker was that the Dutch were absolutely not rallying to their cause, but instead rallying against it.

[(12:24)](#!):

The Franco-Dutch army scored a victory at Bergen on September the 19th, and then fought the Allies to a draw at Alkmaar on October the 2nd, though they did leave the Allies in strategic control of the field. That set up what turned out to be the decisive battle of the campaign at Castricum on October the 6th. After an all-day fight, the British and Russians were broken into a chaotic retreat. This defeat led to a strategic retreat all the way back to their original beachhead. When they got there, the weather took a terrible turn, making resupply and reinforcement from the North Sea nearly impossible.

[(13:03)](#!):

With neither side looking to get bogged down in the siege, through the winter, the French and British negotiated an agreement that allowed the Allied forces to withdraw under very favorable terms, including keeping the ships they had captured from the Dutch. Signed on October the 18th, the Allies started to evacuate, and the brief Anglo-Russian invasion of the Batavian Republic was over. Meanwhile, down in Switzerland, the French were about to enjoy a similar run of success.

[(13:32)](#!):

As a consequence of the invasion of the Batavian Republic, the Austrian and Russian forces down in Switzerland and Italy were shuffled around, much to the great dread of their two best generals, Archduke Charles for the Austrians and the old undefeated Alexander Suvorov for the Russians. In mid-August, new orders came in from the Austrian high command. Archduke Charles was to withdraw the bulk of his army from Switzerland and march them north to anchor the Rhineland, leaving behind 25,000 Austrians and about 30,000 Russians to hold Switzerland.

[(14:05)](#!):

To replace Charles’s army, Suvorov was ordered to stop his attacks on the French in Italy and instead come north to replace the Austrians in Switzerland. Neither commander was happy about these orders, and Charles, like, intentionally lingered and delayed as long as possible before leaving Zurich. His entirely justified concern was that the French general, Andre Massana, had gathered 80,000 men in the window between Charles leaving and Suvorov arriving, would leave Massana with a local numerical advantage, as there would only be about 50,000 Russians and Austrians left holding Zurich.

[(14:42)](#!):

When Charles withdrew, Massana was like, oh, happy day, and immediately drew up plans to go retake Zurich before Suvorov arrived. On September the 25th, Massana led his army on an attack on the city and found the Russian defenders overconfident and underprepared in coordination between them and the Austrians, profoundly lacking. After heavy fighting, the French pushed the Allies back into Zurich itself, and then the next day expelled them from the city in chaos and confusion. The Allies lost something like 13,000 killed, captured, wounded, and the Russians were now in full flight out of the mountains.

[(15:19)](#!):

Meanwhile, Suvorov was just now pushing his way up to reinforce Zurich, only to find that it had already been taken by the French, who were now pivoting south to trap Suvorov in the mountains. But Suvorov slipped the trap and was forced to go on a pretty brutal march through the now snow-covered Alps to escape. His men were exhausted, starving, and frost-bitten when they got out, but they got out.

[(15:45)](#!):

Tsar Paul received word that his two armies in the west were in full retreat at almost the same moment. First news that the invasion of the Netherlands had just flat out gone nowhere, and then that his great armies in Switzerland and Italy, who had been steamrolling the French, were now in a bloody, broken, and exhausted retreat. Paul blamed the Austrians for setting his forces up to fail, and so he did what the Austrians had been worried he would do before they decided to form the second coalition in the first place. In October 1799, Tsar Paul tore up the alliance with the Austrians and withdrew from the war.

[(16:22)](#!):

Now Paul was also pretty ticked off at the British because the Russians had endured the majority of the casualties in the invasion of the Netherlands. The final break with the British would not come until mid-1800, though, by which point the Tsar was chatting it up with French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte about the possibility of a mutually beneficial alliance. And the stately quadrille danced on.

[(16:47)](#!):

Ironically, the great victories of the French in the fall of 1799 and the sudden withdrawal of the Russians from the second coalition did not strengthen and stabilize the directory, but instead paved the way for its overthrow. And that brings us to the final act of our drama, the coup of 18 Brumaire. Now the thing about the coup of 18 Brumaire is that Napoleon Bonaparte was not, in fact, its principal mastermind. That honor goes to recently elected director CS, who was ably aided behind the scenes by recently ousted foreign minister Talleyrand.

[(17:24)](#!):

Now CS, as we’ve already established, has never been a fan of the directory. And his primary goal in joining it seems to have been tearing it down from the inside. And this is something that he had been planning pretty much from the beginning and then really super planning when the neo-Jacobean started to rise back up again. CS believed it would be disastrous for France to fall back into the dark chaos of revolutionary democracy. To accomplish his goal, CS said that he would need a head and a sword. The head would, of course, be his own. So all he really needed was a sword.

[(18:01)](#!):

CS had initially settled on young General Jober to be his sword and had engineered Jober’s promotion to head the Army of Italy in order to enhance Jober’s reputation. But then Jober got beaten and killed at the Battle of Novi, and CS was back to square one.

[(18:17)](#!):

None of the other possible candidates, though, were reliable. Jordan was clearly allied with the neo-Jacobeans. The minister of war, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was too. And indeed, at that same moment, those neo-Jacobeans were talking to Bernadotte about possibly leading a coup from the left. But that never went anywhere. CS finally came around to call on General Moreau, who appears to have hated the Directory with a passion, but he was a soldier, not a politician, and didn’t want to lead any political revolution.

[(18:46)](#!):

As the story goes, CS was meeting with Moreau in mid-October 1799, trying to convince him to be the sword, when word came through that General Bonaparte had landed in France. Both were shocked at the news, as no one knew that Bonaparte had secretly ditched Egypt at the end of August. But Moreau allegedly turned to CS and said, there is your man. Bonaparte had finally arrived in France on October the 10th, after a 40-plus day voyage of successfully dodging British naval patrols.

[(19:20)](#!):

After he landed, word spread like wildfire that the conquering hero had come home. And as he traveled to Paris, he was greeted by jubilant celebrations in every town he passed through. Local dignitaries would come out and meet him, and glad hand him, and generally just cheer and wave their hats.

[(19:38)](#!):

This enthusiastic reception was based primarily on Bonaparte’s reputation as the bringer of peace. Everyone knew that it was Bonaparte who had ended the war, and everyone knew that when he left, it had just started back up again. Of course, everyone did not know about Bonaparte’s failures in Egypt yet, or the central role his invasion had played in starting the War of the Second Coalition in the first place. The people wanted peace, and they believed Bonaparte could deliver it. But if that was really the dream, then wow, guys, Bonaparte is really not your man.

[(20:14)](#!):

When young Bonaparte arrived in Paris, now all of 30 years old, he was scrupulously reserved about what his intentions were. And everyone in the capital projected their hopes onto him. Men who supported the Directory wanted him to support the Directory. The Neo-Jacabins wanted him to lead a coup from the left. CS and his faction wanted him to lead an authoritarian coup from the middle. The only men who didn’t see Bonaparte as a potential champion were the Royalists.

[(20:43)](#!):

It was Talleyrand who took the lead in drawing Bonaparte towards the conspiracy surrounding CS. CS may have been looking everywhere for a sword, but Talleyrand had picked his man right from the moment he returned from his exile in America. All that was left was to convince CS that Bonaparte was, in fact, the guy. But there was a problem. Bonaparte and CS detested each other. CS saw Napoleon as a rustic, uneducated provincial with an overinflated ego. Napoleon saw CS as a pompous aristocrat of dubious loyalties with an overinflated ego.

[(21:21)](#!):

Their partnership nearly failed before it even started due to a standoff between their mutually overinflated egos. When Bonaparte arrived in Paris, both men wanted the other to pay the first call. CS couldn’t believe Bonaparte wouldn’t come around to pay his respects. And Bonaparte said, I pay calls on no one, and was angry CS wouldn’t come to him. It became like a whole thing. Finally, Talleyrand went around to Napoleon and said, you are being an ass. You have to make the first move, so just do it. And Bonaparte reluctantly agreed. It was the last time he would let CS win.

[(21:59)](#!):

For the next two weeks, secret meetings were regularly held to plot the fall of the directory. Besides Bonaparte, CS, and Talleyrand, the other principal conspirators turned out to be Napoleon’s brother Lucien, who was helpfully about to be elected president of the Council of 500, police minister Joseph Fouch\xc3\xa9, who wasn’t supposed to be in on it, but who said, I’ll help out when his spies uncover the plot. Also included were two of the four other directors, Pierre Roget Ducault and Paul Barra. But Barra was included in the plot specifically to prevent him from spilling the beans if he got wind of it.

[(22:37)](#!):

The secret secret plan was to purge Barra along with everyone else when the time came because nobody trusted him. For now, though, he was allowed to believe he was one of the inner circle conspirators. The coup was arranged to unfold in three stages. First, all five directors would resign simultaneously. Second, the legislative councils would be induced to appoint a new provisional executive to replace the directory. And then third, that provisional executive would draft a new constitution.

[(23:09)](#!):

But despite their careful planning, the coup was a very near run thing, partly because it was planned to unfold too slowly, partly because it paid too much attention to constitutional protocol, and partly because Bonaparte himself was impetuous and impatient. As Duff Cooper says in his classic biography of Talleyrand, if you’re going to stage a coup, it has to be fast, it has to be willing to break the law, and you need a level head. And that does not really describe the coup of 18 Brumaire. But because there wasn’t a real emergency out there that the conspirators could point to and say, hey, we need to rewrite the Constitution because emergency, emergency, they had to invent one.

[(23:50)](#!):

For this, they could have gone one of two ways, either trump up a royalist insurrection or trump up a neo-Jacobin insurrection. After multiple discussions, the plotters settled on and invented insurrection from the left. The left was stronger and would likely fight harder, and so it would be helpful to take them out at the knees before they knew what hit them. After securing the services of some friendly printers to pump out propaganda, financing from some friendly bankers, and assurances from a cadre of officers that they would follow Bonaparte when the time came, there was nothing left to do but do it.

[(24:29)](#!):

On the morning of November the 9th, 1799, 18 Brumaire, year eight, Paris woke to find posters plastered all over the city warning of a Jacobin plot to overthrow the government. CS then dispatched a summons to the delegates of the Council of 500 to meet for an early emergency session, a summons he accidentally forgot to give 60 delegates identified as most likely to be hostile.

[(24:53)](#!):

When this emergency session met, council president Lucian Bonaparte stood up and said, gentlemen, we are all in imminent danger, a mob uprising not seen since the old days of revolutionary chaos is in the making. Lucian then recommended the council immediately quit Paris and relocate to the nearby town of Saint-Clu. The bewildered and nervous delegates agreed. When the Council of Ancients met a few hours later, they were surprised to find the Council of 500 had already approved the move and that they all had to beat it out of town right away.

[(25:25)](#!):

To protect the fleeing delegates and defend the government, the Council of 500 transferred command of all Paris area soldiers to General Napoleon Bonaparte. After all, General Bonaparte had once saved the government from a royalist uprising on 13 Fond de Mier with his fabled whiff of grape shot. Who better to protect us? And so the sword was given his sword.

[(25:48)](#!):

So, so far, things are going pretty good. As the councils evacuated Paris, it was time for the five directors to resign. But only two of them were actually in on it, though, CS and Roger Ducault. Barras, like I said, thought he was in on it. But then on the morning of 18 Brumaire, CS and Ducault dropped out of sight, and Barras could not locate them or contact them. Then the other two directors, General Moulin and Louis Jerome Goyet, started sending Barras frantic messages. What is going on? You have to do something. And Barras must have been like, well, I thought I was doing something, but it looks like something is being done to me.

[(26:28)](#!):

Then Talleyrand came around to Barras’ house with a pre-written letter of resignation and said, sorry, old chum, but you need to go. Realizing he had been dealt a fake hand, Barras decided it wasn’t worth fighting. It’s also like 99% certain that Talleyrand also delivered an enormous bribe to make this all go down easier, though Barras later denied it.

[(26:50)](#!):

Barras was in his carriage and on his way out of Paris by the end of the day. In the meantime, CS and Ducault already signed their own resignations, leaving Moulin and Goyet as an impotent rump. Then General Moreau played his part in the coup. He showed up at their apartments with a company of soldiers, arrested the two directors, and kept them under lock and key until they too agreed to resign. But then things started to get dicey, and dicey in part because this was all planned to unfold over two days instead of being wrapped up by day one.

[(27:23)](#!):

Because when the councils convened in Saint-Clu the following day, they discovered there was shockingly little evidence to support Lucien Bonaparte’s claim about this alleged Jacobin uprising. It was starting to become very clear that they had been duped. But to what end, and for what purpose, they did not yet know. And that is when Napoleon blundered in. Under the impression that the councils would compliantly agree to create a new provisional government and then go away, he was annoyed that this was all taking too long. So he pushed his way into the Council of Ancients flanked by soldiers. And the delegates were like, oh, we get it now. Bonaparte is trying to overthrow us.

[(28:01)](#!):

The general tried to address them to demand that they order constitutional revisions. But he was heckled pretty mercilessly, causing him to lose his temper and storm out. He marched over to the Council of 500 and there received an even more hostile reception. They too shouted him down, called him a tyrant. Calls went out to outlaw him, declare him an enemy of the state. Some of the delegates went so far as to actually manhandle Bonaparte and push him out of the hall, cutting his cheek in the process.

[(28:32)](#!):

Bonaparte had stormed into the councils to cow them into submission and instead had left them agitated and emboldened and not wanting to go along with anything. The success of the coup was now very much in doubt.

[(28:47)](#!):

The Bonaparte who saved the day was Lucien. He followed his brother out of the Council of 500 and spun a wild lie to the assembled soldiers that a company of ultra-radical delegates were inside, that they had daggers, that they had just tried to assassinate Napoleon, and were threatening the councils with further violence. Led by Joaquim Mira, the man who had led the cavalry charge against the Turks in the last battle in Egypt and who was one of the few officers chosen to return home with Bonaparte, the assembled soldiers charged in and cleared the halls, sending some of the delegates literally running into the woods to hide.

[(29:23)](#!):

When the dust settled, the conspirators rounded up enough compliant delegates to form a quorum and induced them to call for a six-week recess while changes to the constitution were discussed. Then they appointed three provisional consuls to take the lead in those discussions, and wouldn’t you know it, those three were CS, Bonaparte, and Roget du Co.

[(29:44)](#!):

The councils then appointed 50 men to stay in session to work with the consuls on the revisions to the constitution while the rest of the delegates went home to wait for the results. They would wait forever. The temporary recess turned out to be permanent. When the Council of 500 and Council of Ancients went home on November the 10th, 1799, they were never recalled. The Directory was dead.

[(30:11)](#!):

But as you can see, the coup of 18 Brumaire doesn’t quite get Napoleon all the way into power. He’s one of the three provisional consuls, sure, but CS obviously believes that he is going to be the dominant personality of the new government. Now that the sword has done his work, CS believed he would be able to run political circles around Bonaparte. The head is craftier than the sword, right? Except, my god, we’re talking about Napoleon Bonaparte here. So obviously CS has wildly underestimated his man.

[(30:45)](#!):

Bonaparte was able to exploit the fact that the coup of Brumaire would not have been possible without armed intervention from the army. And because that army was loyal to Bonaparte, Napoleon wound up playing a super active role in the writing of the Constitution of Year 8, which set up what we call the French Consulate.

[(31:03)](#!):

Now Bonaparte and CS did agree on a few things. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have even gotten into the business of using each other to seize power. They agreed, for example, that too much democracy, too many destabilizing elections, was not a good thing. So the Constitution of Year 8 created this unwieldy apparatus where a commune’s voters would get together and vote 10% of their members to a departmental assembly, who would vote 10% of their members to a national assembly. And then from that assembly, a wholly new unelected institution called the Senate would pick 100 men to serve in a tribunate and 300 men to serve in a legislative assembly. The tribunes would be allowed to debate a bill. The legislative assembly would be allowed to vote on it.

[(31:50)](#!):

But neither would have the right to introduce a bill in the first place. That would be left to a small and also unelected council of state. The entire thing was designed to keep the people as far away from the process as possible. But Bonaparte and CS differed on the all-important executive. Both believed it must be the central power of the state.

[(32:16)](#!):

CS, though, wanted to create two consuls, one for domestic affairs and one for foreign affairs. CS planned obviously to be one of the first two consuls, but he did not want the other to be Bonaparte, and Bonaparte knew it. CS instead dreamed up this office he called the Grand Elector. The Grand Elector would be appointed for life and serve as a constitutional figurehead, and beyond the power to appoint the consuls, the Grand Elector would have no other power. And that is where CS wanted Bonaparte to go. Bonaparte famously said, though, that he would not play the part of a fatted pig and push to keep the system of three consuls in place. And once he had this concession in hand, Bonaparte ensured that it would be an unequal triad, with the first consul enjoying all kinds of special prerogatives. And wouldn’t you know it, Bonaparte got himself appointed first consul.

[(33:13)](#!):

Hotally outmaneuvered, CS was shuffled off into the Senate, where he would play an important role, but one clearly subordinate to first consul Bonaparte, who turned out to have been both the head and the sword.

[(33:30)](#!):

When the Constitution of Year 8 was promulgated, it came with a preface that ended by saying that it was based on the sacred rights of property, equality, and liberty that the revolution had been dedicated to from the beginning, that the new Constitution would be strong and stable, that it would protect the rights of citizens and the health of the state. Citizens, it said, the revolution is established on the principles with which it began. It is over.

[(33:59)](#!):

And indeed, it was. The Constitution of Year 8 was the first constitution since the beginning of the revolution that was not prefaced with a clear declaration of rights. The revolution was indeed over. But though we know what comes next, no one at the time could have possibly known that it really was the end of the revolution, and that inside of five years, first consul Bonaparte would transform into Emperor Napoleon I. Drawing a line between the revolution and the age of Napoleon is a tricky and inexact and ultimately futile business. The run from the fall of the Bastille to Waterloo is all one continuous story.

[(34:43)](#!):

But our story is now done. Napoleon Bonaparte is the de facto ruler of France. But I am not just going to leave you hanging like that. Next week, we will return for one last plunge into the breach with a special two-part finale, one episode that looks backward over the ground we’ve covered to try to make some sense of what we’ve witnessed, and one episode that looks forward to give you at least a summary of what comes next, and then take a look at what remains of the revolution after the Restoration in 1815.

And welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.53, The Consulate.

[(01:28)](#!):

So a funny thing happened on my way to the finish line. On Friday morning, my hard drive crashed. I didn’t lose any files, but I did lose an incredibly necessary day of work while my computer was being fixed. As a consequence, I had to abandon the dream of writing the final retrospective before I went on break. Luckily, the episode I had written on Napoleon had ballooned to over 7,000 words, so what I decided to do instead was break that one huge episode into two smaller episodes. First that focused on the Consulate, and a second on the Empire, and so here we are. The final retrospective will be written, but it will just randomly show up in your feed one day. I’m not going to not write it, I’m just not going to write it right now. Pretty rotten timing, but such is life. So on with the end of the show.

[(02:21)](#!):

We know now that Napoleon coming to power in November 1799 turned out to be a watershed moment not just in the course of the French Revolution, but for the course of world history period. But as I said at the end of last week’s show, no one who woke up on the morning after the coup of Brumaire could have possibly known how momentous Bonaparte’s ascension to power would turn out to be. Coups and countercoups and purges had defined the French Revolution for the last decade, so the new French Consulate might last a thousand years. Then again, it might not make it till spring. Who could tell?

[(02:56)](#!):

In the end, the Consulate would last five years, before it gave way to the Empire, which lasted for another ten, before it gave way to the Bourbon Restoration that closed the whole great cycle set off by the bankruptcy of the monarchy in 1786. So what I want to do here today is give a brief summary of the next five years, with a particular emphasis on providing some closure for a few of the threads we’ve been following for so long but which are still left open. The fate of the Church, the economy, the legal system, and of course the wars, the wars, and the more wars, because aside from 1802, it’s basically just one non-stop war.

[(03:36)](#!):

The French Consulate was officially inaugurated in February 1800, when the Constitution of Year 8 was ratified in a general referendum by the rather unbelievable margin of three million to one thousand five hundred. Now people like to point to this as proof of Napoleon’s transparently anti-democratic instincts. And while it’s true that Bonaparte was not big on democracy, it’s not like the votes on previous Constitutions had been any different. Remember, the Constitution of 1793 had passed one point seven million to sixteen thousand. The Constitution of Year 3 had passed one million to forty-nine thousand. So it’s not like the unbelievable verdict on the Constitution of Year 8 was wildly out of line with previous constitutional referendums. But that said, the results of the referendum were obviously rigged, and the vote was purely for show.

[(04:28)](#!):

Now as I mentioned at the end of last week’s episode, the one group that had not been major players for Bonaparte’s hand after he returned from Egypt were the Royalists. But the fact that he had just climbed to power by stomping on the Jacobins had raised Royalist hopes that Bonaparte might still play General Monk to Louis XVIII’s King Charles II. The Restoration of the Stewarts was a historical episode they all knew quite well. King Louis XVIII personally wrote to the new first consul in those very terms.

[(04:59)](#!):

But Bonaparte had no intention of going down merely as another monk, though he was careful to play his cards close to the vest. He did not reply to the king, but he did not overtly dismiss him either. The Catholic and royal rebels out in the West were rising back up again, and Bonaparte didn’t want to alienate them by coming out firmly against the idea of restoration. He wanted to ensure domestic tranquility, because he was about to have to go out and deal with the looming Second Coalition.

[(05:29)](#!):

But Bonaparte was also aware that restoring the monarchy was in many ways the least of the Western rebel demands, and so he arranged meetings with those leaders to address their real concerns\xe2\x80\x94the preservation of traditional Catholicism and military conscription. He said, look, I’m utterly committed to freedom of worship so you’ll be able to worship how you want, I’m canceling the law of hostages that would have come down hard on your families, and with luck I’m about to go win the war so conscription just won’t be a thing.

[(05:59)](#!):

This all sounded pretty good to the potential rebels. So rather than the West going totally to hell in 1800, like it had in 1793, Bonaparte was able to defuse the situation, and the unrest died down. And this was crucial for Bonaparte, because a lot of the guys that he’s about to lead across the Rhine would not have been available had there been a new war in the Bonde.

[(06:22)](#!):

As he was defusing the West, Bonaparte was also trying to defuse the Second Coalition, so that maybe he wouldn’t have to go back to fighting at all, with the Russians having withdrawn from the Second Coalition in a huff. The new First Consul reached out to both the Austrians and the British, and offered to settle a peace on the basic terms of compo formio, but both rebuffed his overtures. So war was set to resume in the spring of 1800.

[(06:48)](#!):

Now in overall strategic command of the war, Bonaparte actually wound up following the basic outline employed by the Directory in 1796\xe2\x80\x94that Germany would be the main theater, and Italy merely a secondary front. But General Moreau, now in charge of the Army of the Rhine as a reward for his part in the coup of 18 Brumaire, thought the First Consul’s plan for an aggressive thrust across the Rhine impractical and he resisted the order. He basically said, we’ve tried this before, I’ve tried this before, and it did not turn out well. Not wanting to alienate Moreau, because he was not yet firmly entrenched in power, Bonaparte agreed to focus all his attention on Italy. So in 1800, the First Consul personally led the Army of Reserve, which is basically the domestic forces stationed inside France, on a fairly daring push through the Alps into northern Italy. This is famously captured in Jacques-Louis David’s great Napoleon Crossing the Alps, where Bonaparte is pictured astride a magnificent white steed, but just so you know, he actually made the crossing riding a donkey.

[(07:55)](#!):

Emerging into northern Italy, Bonaparte retook Milan on June 2nd, and then, with an army of about 22,000, faced off against about 30,000 Austrians at Marigno on June 14th. The French very nearly lost the battle, and that could have been it right there for Bonaparte, but at the end of the day, 6,000 French reinforcements arrived and knocked out the exhausted Austrians. After that, Austria asked for an armistice and agreed to evacuate Lombardy and Liguria, a ceasefire between the Austrian and French armies facing each other along the Rhine soon followed. After Marigno, Bonaparte again demanded the Austrians make peace on the basis of Campo Formio, but believing the armistice was just a temporary pause to catch their breath, the Austrians refused, and hostilities resumed in November.

[(08:46)](#!):

When Bonaparte ordered Moreau across the Rhine this time, there was no pushback. Moreau led about 56,000 men, and he managed to ambush and encircle 64,000 Austrians at Hohenlinden on December 3rd. The Austrian army was crushed. By Christmas, peace talks were well underway, culminating with the Treaty of Lunaville in February 1801.

[(09:09)](#!):

This treaty was negotiated primarily by the consulate’s foreign minister, Talleyrand, and was settled, wouldn’t you know it, on the basis of Campo Formio. Talleyrand also made a huge fortune during these negotiations by taking bribes from various German princes to settle things in their favor, because that’s just how he rolls.

[(09:30)](#!):

With his victory over the Austrians solidifying his political position back in Paris, Bonaparte started to lay the groundwork for a unified authoritarian state under his personal rule. He finally replied to King Louis in September 1800 and said, dear self-declared king, I would be more than happy to pay for your retirement, but do not think of coming home. You’d have to walk over 100,000 corpses to get here.

[(09:56)](#!):

But it was really only the king that Bonaparte wanted to keep away. Everyone else was welcome to come home if they wanted to. Formerly prescribed emigres were told that all the prescriptions and penalties against them were canceled. This was followed up in October by a general amnesty for men who had taken up arms against France. The only condition was that the emigres had to acknowledge that the lands they had lost during the course of the revolution were gone for good. To secure his middle-class flank, Bonaparte guaranteed that land titles purchased at auction would be recognized as valid full stop.

[(10:32)](#!):

This would not, however, stop emigres from slowly repurchasing their lands and rebuilding their old estates. Indeed, by the time of the restoration, many noble families were back in possession of most of what they had owned before the fall of the Bastille, which was fine with Napoleon just so long as the land was repurchased, not simply claimed by hereditary right.

[(10:54)](#!):

The rehabilitation and reintegration of the royalists was nearly derailed on Christmas Eve 1800, when Bonaparte was almost blown to bits by assassins in Paris. But the fuse-lit bomb that was supposed to go off when the first consul’s carriage passed was lit too late, and it didn’t explode until after he was passed. In the aftermath of the attempt, Minister of Police Joseph Fouch\xc3\xa9 uncovered evidence that the plotters had been intractable royalists from the West who refused to reconcile with the consulate. But that did not fit the narrative Bonaparte was building. He wanted everyone to believe that the royalists were with him to a man, and that the greatest threat to public order was actually Jacobin anarchists. So Fouch\xc3\xa9 was ordered to arrest 130 Jacobins for their invented role in the attempt. Four wound up guillotined, five shot, and the rest were exiled.

[(11:48)](#!):

This while Fouch\xc3\xa9 held in custody the men he actually knew to be responsible. Bonaparte’s continued turn against the left and rehabilitation of the right also put him on the verge of scoring a new ally, because Russia was now deep in talks with France about an alliance. Tsar Paul clearly saw in the autocratic Bonaparte someone he could deal with, rather than that mob of frenzied French republicans he had been so hell-bent on destroying the year before. The Russians started coordinating what was called the Army of Neutrals, a formally unaligned coalition of powers surrounding the Baltic Sea, whose rise was clearly aimed at containing the British.

[(12:30)](#!):

All of this was upset, however, when Tsar Paul was assassinated in March 1801 and replaced by his son, the far more formidable Tsar Alexander, who, for the time being, pulled back from the French into studied neutrality.

[(12:45)](#!):

But though the first consul did not win a new ally, he did manage to shed his last enemy. After nearly a decade of war, the British were finally getting sick of it all, especially since they were now left all on their own again. In February 1801, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, the strongest anti-French voice in the government, resigned after his move to relax anti-Catholic laws to forge a stronger and more stable union with Ireland was rejected by King George III. With Pitt gone, the ministry sent out peace feelers to France.

[(13:20)](#!):

And so though there was still technically a war on, Napoleon was able to spend most of the next year focused on domestic concerns.

[(13:29)](#!):

First Consul Bonaparte capitalized on the de facto peace and further entrenched the new order he had been building since Brumaire. And a key to this was solidifying the state finances and making sure that the money guys were on his side. He formed the Bank of France, a central bank that would handle state finances, and he promised that the remaining national debt would be paid in time and in cash. The value of government debt notes doubled almost overnight. Tax collection was also vastly improved by this point, so state revenue was actually there to meet these obligations. And this, as I mentioned back in episode 3.47, was entirely due to the efforts of the directory’s finance minister, Rommel, who had repudiated two-thirds of the state’s debt back in 1797 and had then formed the new centralized tax collection agency. Had it not been for Rommel, Bonaparte would have had an impossible time stabilizing the state’s finances. But by 1802, France was actually running a budget surplus.

[(14:37)](#!):

The First Consul was also obsessed with completely overhauling law and order in France. From almost his first day in office, Bonaparte had been hard at work on what would become the Napoleonic Code, one of the single most influential law books in human history. Finally published in full in 1804, the Napoleonic Code represented the achievement of a dream the Revolution had been striving for since the Estates-General had first been called. Scrap the contradictory, obscure, and illogical laws of the Ancien R\xc3\xa9gime and replace them with a single, unified, clearly spelled out set of rules that applied to everyone equally. Though Napoleon himself obviously felt bound by no laws, he wanted his nation to enjoy the peace and security that comes with the rule of law.

[(15:26)](#!):

The Napoleonic Code is without a doubt one of his great contributions to the development of the modern world, and the legal systems of a ton of different countries right now today are rooted in the Napoleonic Code. But Bonaparte’s greatest achievement during this period, in terms of his immediate situation, was reconciling France with the Catholic Church.

[(15:50)](#!):

Since the occupation of Rome, Pope Pius VI had been in French custody. The Pope since 1775 had been staunchly anti-revolution the whole time. When he died in August 1799, there was real talk that he might actually be the last pope.

[(16:13)](#!):

But Bonaparte believed that reconciling with the Church was essential to restoring domestic tranquility and his own personal rule. You know how out in the West it’s always the Catholic and Royal Army? Just think if the Catholic part is cut out, the Royalists wouldn’t have a leg to stand on if they were no longer the only defenders of traditional religion, and they will have to reconcile with my regime. So the First Consul gave permission to the College of Cardinals to hold a conclave in Venice, and that conclave elected Pius VII, who was a more practical politician than his predecessor, and who would make a fine negotiating partner for the First Consul.

[(16:53)](#!):

So shortly after restoring French hegemony in Italy following the Battle of Marengo, Bonaparte entered into talks with the new pope to restore the French Catholic Church. In July 1801, the two sides reached an agreement called the Concordat of 1801. The Church acknowledged that lands it had lost in France in 1789 were not coming back. They also agreed that freedom of worship in France would be a thing. Bonaparte was clear about that, and he really did believe in it.

[(17:23)](#!):

But the Concordat also re-established state support for the Catholic Church, though it did fall short of making Catholicism the official state religion. The Concordat also brought back the Sunday rhythm of the week, and rolled back strict laws about adhering to the Republican calendar\xe2\x80\x94a calendar which Bonaparte would keep around until 1806, when he finally let it slip into oblivion, where it would henceforth only trouble students of history trying to make sense of an already too-complicated historical era.

[(17:55)](#!):

Now as had been the case before the Revolution, the Concordat of 1801 said that France’s head of state would select French bishops. And in preparation for the renewed Church, all existing bishops\xe2\x80\x94refractory and constitutional alike\xe2\x80\x94were ordered to resign. Bonaparte would build a new college of bishops from scratch, taking some from the refractories and some from the Constitutionals. Bonaparte also got the Pope to say it was okay for French bishops to take an oath of allegiance to France\xe2\x80\x94something the revolutionaries had been trying to shove down clerical throats since the very beginning. With the Pope’s permission, they finally accepted the oath.

[(18:33)](#!):

When it was all worked out, the Concordat of 1801 basically healed one of the great festering wounds that had been opened by the Revolution\xe2\x80\x94a wound that had helped turn the good revolution of 1789, defined by the Declaration of the Rights of Man, into the bad revolution of 1792, defined by the Reign of Terror.

[(18:54)](#!):

But because he was Napoleon, that is of course not quite the end of it. When the Concordat was presented to the Pope for his final signature in April 1802, it was accompanied by a unilateral addition made by Bonaparte called the 77 Organic Laws, which definitely put the Church under the state’s jurisdiction and limited the supremacy of Catholicism in France because Bonaparte was equally concerned about Protestant revolts being triggered by overzealous clergymen. Dropped on his desk at the last minute, the Pope went along with it, rather than lose France back to the atheists.

[(19:30)](#!):

At the end of 1801, Talleyrand was then wrapping up the terms of a final peace with the British, and the Concordat was on its way to the printer, and so Bonaparte was feeling pretty strong politically. But one guy who thought he was a little too strong was Bonaparte’s old partner-in-crime C.S. C.S. believed in a strong executive, but the First Consul was taking things altogether too far, so C.S. started urging the tribunate and the Legislative Assembly to stand up to the First Consul, to not just rubber-stamp his every decree.

[(20:04)](#!):

When Bonaparte got wind of this, he decided to invoke a vague clause in the Constitution of Year 8 that said the tribunate and Legislative Assembly would be renewed in Year 10 without saying when or how. The First Consul said, uh, we’re doing it now and under my personal direction. He got the Senate to drop a list of men who would be kept on, dropping 60 troublemakers from the Legislative Assembly and 20 from the tribunate. But Bonaparte just wanted these guys out of the way, not forming the core of some bitter opposition, so he made sure to find them state jobs elsewhere. You know, you’re out of power, but you’re going to be very comfortably out of power.

[(20:46)](#!):

Shortly after this little purge, the French and British finally signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802. Once again negotiated by Talleyrand, the treaty not only ended the war of the Second Coalition for good, but it brought a general peace to Europe for the first time since 1792. Talleyrand himself thought that this was the end of it. France had reached its natural boundaries. The balance of power in Europe seemed stable. Britain was finally laying down their arms. It was the dawn of a permanent peace. And for the moment, it seemed like he might be right. 1802 would go down as the year of peace. For the first time in a decade, there was no war in Europe.

[(21:32)](#!):

So in the spring of 1802, Bonaparte has in hand the Treaty of Lunaville, which took the Austrians out, the Treaty of Amiens, which took the British out, the Concordant of 1801, which dealt with the Church, and a compliant government.

[(21:46)](#!):

Trade was prospering again. Prices were rising, all those scarce goods that France had been deprived of for a decade were now flooding back onto the market. Both popular and successful, Bonaparte exploited all this good news and rewrote the Constitution of Year 8 to give the First Consul even more power. The resulting Constitution of Year 10 was thoroughly autocratic and included a provision making Bonaparte First Consul for life. As I’ve mentioned, this moment is often recognized as the true and logical end of the French Revolution. As now so many of the Revolution’s aspirations had been achieved, so many of its open wounds healed, France was at peace for the first time since 1792, and Bonaparte is now de facto dictator for life. So clearly, the French Revolution is over.

[(22:40)](#!):

But though France is now a dictatorship, it is not a joke to see in Bonaparte’s rule not the repudiation of the Revolution, but rather its total fulfillment. In so many ways, he was finally achieving the dreams of the early revolutionaries. He was certainly embodying the kind of enlightened despotism the philosophs had been calling for back in the 1760s and 1770s. And look what he’s done. France is now a thoroughly modern state, centrally run, pretty efficient, abiding by a rational and comprehensive and universal code of laws. Church prerogatives are recognized but subservient to the state, and freedom of worship is guaranteed. All public offices are open to men of merit. Promotion was based mostly on talent. All the old hated privileges of the Church and nobility were totally swept aside, now replaced with something far more equalitarian and meritocratic. Feudal privilege had been replaced by the universal rule of law. Sure, democracy was dead and freedom of the press was thoroughly curtailed, but you could live with that.

[(23:47)](#!):

But the happy days of the Year of Peace would not last, and neither would the enlightened consulate. Despite Talleyrand’s hope, tensions between France and Britain were not much relieved by the Treaty of Amiens, and both had complaints about the other’s conduct. In March 1803, the British abandoned the treaty and re-declared war. Napoleon began plotting an invasion of the British Isles. Now this brewing conflict was restricted to the British and French, until a scandal in early 1804 helped break it wide open. An emigre Duke living in the German city of Baden was implicated in a royalist plot to assassinate First Consul for Life Bonaparte.

[(24:27)](#!):

Now the plot was real enough, but the Duke’s involvement was nonexistent. Nevertheless, Bonaparte had his soldiers cross into Baden beyond the limits of his sovereign authority, arrest the Duke, try him in secret, and then have him executed. The assassination plot itself, and then Bonaparte’s scandalous reaction to it, had two major repercussions. First, the secret execution of the Duke seems to have played a decisive role in turning the other European heads of state against the First Consul. They suddenly became open to the British, who were saying, we need to nip this guy in the bud because he’s actually scary as hell.

[(25:08)](#!):

The willingness of the other European powers to form a new anti-French coalition prompted an apocryphal quote which is variously attributed either to Fouche or Talleyrand, that the execution of the Duke was worse than a crime. It was a mistake. The other repercussion was that it convinced Bonaparte and his closest allies that were he to be killed, the French Republic would be thrown into chaos. They decided the best way to solve this problem was to inaugurate a new hereditary dynasty, so that if Bonaparte should die, named heirs would be in place so the regime itself could live on. Powered far more by the example of the Caesars than the decayed monarchies of Europe, Bonaparte and his advisors dreamed up a whole new imperial state, with Napoleon at its center. He would be nothing less than Emperor.

[(26:01)](#!):

In May 1804, the Senate formally transformed First Consul Bonaparte into Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. And then in December, an elaborately staged coronation was held that saw Napoleon crown himself Emperor. He claimed to derive his authority not from God but from the people. But in crowning himself, it was pretty clear where he thought his power was coming from.

[(26:27)](#!):

The French Republic was now the French Empire. And if the revolution didn’t end with the beheading of Robespierre in 1794, or the coup of Brumaire in 1799, or Bonaparte becoming First Consul for life in 1802, then it must certainly end here.

[(26:46)](#!):

A 34-year-old German composer on the cusp of greatness sure thought Napoleon crowning himself Emperor marked the end of the revolution. Ludwig van Beethoven was an enlightened admirer of the romantic hero Bonaparte and had dedicated his spectacular, groundbreaking Third Symphony to the First Consul. But when Napoleon crowned himself Emperor, Beethoven angrily scratched out or tore up the dedication, and the Third Symphony was subsequently published in 1806 as the Heroic Symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man.

[(27:21)](#!):

So we’ll leave it there for now, and come back next time for a lightning march through the Napoleonic Empire and the restoration of the monarchy, which will really, seriously, end the French Revolution.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.54, The Empire.

[(01:36)](#!):

Over the winter of 1804-1805, Emperor Napoleon I knew that come the spring he was going to have to march out to prove to the world that he deserved the imperial crown he had just bestowed upon himself. And when the inevitable war of the Third Coalition started up, he would not only prove it, he would achieve some of the most spectacular victories in military history. And this is really when he moves from the very good, even great, General Bonaparte to Napoleon.

[(02:06)](#!):

The Third Anti-French Coalition got to forming right after First Consul Bonaparte became Emperor Napoleon. Nobody much liked where this all seemed to be headed. The Swedish signed an alliance with the British in December 1804, forming the first link, and then Tsar Alexander signed Russia up in April 1805. The Austrians then joined a few months later when Emperor Napoleon decided to have himself crowned King of Italy, a provocative declaration in what they still considered to be their backyard. The new Kingdom of Italy Napoleon just crowned himself King of covered all of Northern Italy, and this marks an important break with his revolutionary past. As he conquered and reorganized Europe, which he’s about to do, Napoleon would no longer be creating sister republics, he will instead be creating client kingdoms. And so Northern Italy is now no longer the Cisalpine Republic, it is the Kingdom of Italy, and Napoleon himself was its king.

[(03:03)](#!):

Before the Third Coalition formed, Napoleon had been planning to finally invade the British Isles, to do what he had once said ought not be done. And to this end, he had gathered an army along the Channel Coast and had been drilling them relentlessly. The officers got to know the men, the men got to know the officers, and everybody got to know exactly what they needed to do should they be put into the field. But when it became apparent in late 1804 that Russia and Austria were about to get pretty belligerent, Napoleon pulled this well-drilled army off the coast and marched them east. And that army became the core of the legendary Grand Army, one of the greatest and most invincible armies ever constructed. When the Grand Army crossed the Rhine and made contact with the Allies, it turned out they were just miles better than their opponents. Crossing into Bavaria in August 1805, Napoleon executed a brilliant sweeping flank of the Austrian forces during the Ulm Campaign, which culminated in 1805 with the complete encirclement of the enemy. The French captured 60,000 Austrians and lost only 2,000 men of their own. Then Napoleon marched on the Austrian capital of Vienna and took it.

[(04:17)](#!):

But the Austrians weren’t quite ready to give up because right at that moment the Russians arrived to reinforce them, and the remaining rump of the Austrian army joined with the Russians, forming an army 85,000 strong to face off against Napoleon’s 67,000 at Austerlitz. The Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon’s crowning achievement. He tricked the Allies into thinking the French army was in trouble. He pulled his men off the high ground and intentionally weakened his right flank, and it was all just too enticing for the Allies to pass up. His enemies having fallen into the trap, Napoleon crushed them. It was a bloody victory, but 36,000 Allies wound up killed, captured, or wounded. It was a spectacular victory.

[(04:60)](#!):

The immediate result of Austerlitz was nothing less than the final disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire.

[(05:06)](#!):

Hotally beaten, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II signed the Punitive Treaty of Pressburg on December 26, 1805. It passed huge chunks of territory to new French-aligned states like the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy and the about-to-be-created Confederation of the Rhine, which was forged by all those German princes who had gotten really sick of the Habsburgs at the Congress of Rustat and now looked to France rather than Austria as their natural ally. Austerlitz made it possible for them to break with the Habsburgs decisively. Francis then renounced the title Holy Roman Emperor and became merely Francis I of Austria, thus ending the nearly thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire for good.

[(05:53)](#!):

But of course, Napoleon’s spectacular victory on land was not matched by victory at sea. On October 21, 1805, in between the Ulm Campaign and Austerlitz, Admiral Nelson thrashed the French navy at Trafalgar. Nelson died in the fighting, but his victory ensured that Britain would control the seas for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars. It also set the stage for mutual economic warfare. The British set up a blockade of Europe to strangle the French Empire economically, and Napoleon responded by declaring a continent-wide embargo on trade with Britain. The resulting attempt to enforce, or break, Napoleon’s so-called continental system paved the way for Napoleon’s undoing, as Spain and Russia were the two major cracks through which the British were able to keep up their international supply lines.

[(06:43)](#!):

After the Holy Roman Empire was wiped off the map, and Napoleon was gobbling up all its territory, the Prussians finally roused themselves from the neutrality they had maintained since 1795, and in the spring of 1806 joined what then became known as the Fourth Coalition, which is really just the Third Coalition, with Austria being replaced by Prussia. But this turned out to be a pretty bad move on Prussia’s part. In a double battle fought at Jena and Auerstedt on October 14, 1806, the Grand Army annihilated the Prussians. 67,000 French took out 120,000 Prussians. The French then occupied Berlin, and then just kept rolling right on through Poland all the way to the Russian frontier. Then in June 1807, a French army 80,000 strong crushed 60,000 Russians at the Battle of Friedland, forcing Tsar Alexander to come to the table. So as it was turning out, Emperor Napoleon not only deserved his title, he was basically invincible. We started the show with five great major powers\xe2\x80\x94Britain, France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia\xe2\x80\x94and Napoleon has just basically taken out three of them.

[(07:54)](#!):

But though he had beaten the Russians, Napoleon really wanted them to be his friend, not his enemy. So he cultivated a relationship with young Tsar Alexander, and as the French and Russians negotiated the subsequent Treaty of Tilsit, the Russians were granted pretty generous terms. The Prussians, meanwhile, got it square in the face. The French and Russians agreed to the dismemberment of Prussia. From Prussian lands in Poland, Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw and then handed territory to the west and south over to the new Kingdom of Holland and the Confederation of the Rhine. A Prussian kingdom remained on the map, but much reduced and now a full client of the French Empire. Its army, for example, was now Napoleon’s to command.

[(08:38)](#!):

But though the Treaty of Tilsit in many ways represents the apex of Napoleon’s power, sown within it were the seeds of discontent, especially between Napoleon and his foreign minister Talleyrand.

[(08:50)](#!):

Talleyrand was opposed to the harsh treaties of Pressborg and Tilsit that humiliated the Austrians and Prussians. Rather than laying the foundations of a stable peace, Talleyrand saw only fuel for future wars that a now badly overextended French Empire would not be able to cope with. Tilsit marks the beginning of Talleyrand turning on Napoleon and coming to the belief that for the good of Europe, Napoleon’s imperial ambitions were going to have to be checked. Talleyrand resigned as foreign minister in 1807, but, critically, he was kept on as a senior councilor of state.

[(09:27)](#!):

So the new map of Europe created by the treaties of Pressborg and Tilsit is a handy moment to run through Bonaparte’s use of his family to rule Europe. He was really hoping to forge a pan-European imperial family who could be trusted to run the empire. And though he did not yet have a son, something that was creating lots of tension between Napoleon and his wife Josephine, Napoleon did have lots of brothers and sisters to cement the Bonaparte imperial dynasty. His brother Joseph, for example, was made King of Naples in 1806, and as we’re about to see, will be made King of Spain in 1808. His younger brother Louis was made King of Holland in 1806 when Napoleon decided he could not trust the government of the Batavian Republic to run the blockade on the British, though, as it would turn out, he couldn’t really trust Louis either. Louis basically went native while running Holland and started to identify more with his Dutch subjects than his imperial brother, forcing Napoleon to remove Louis as king in 1810. Another brother, Jerome, was made King of Westphalia. His sister Eliza was made Grand Duchess of Tuscany, and then another sister, Caroline, was married off to Joachim Mira, one of Napoleon’s key lieutenants, who was then himself made King of Naples in 1808. When the Revolutionary Wars began in 1792, one of the grand aims was to sweep aside the old royal dynasties, and Napoleon achieved this, only to replace them with a new imperial dynasty. One guy you might have noticed missing from that list was Lucien Bonaparte, who had been so critical to the success of Brumaire. It turns out that Lucien was a Republican true believer who was not at all happy with his brother’s autocratic turn. Napoleon tried to marry Lucien off to a Spanish princess, but Lucien refused and then went into self-imposed exile in Italy. After years of living under de facto house arrest, he tried to escape to America, but was captured by the British shortly after putting to sea. This wasn’t so bad for Lucien, though, because when he was brought to England, he was celebrated as the good Bonaparte, the one who had turned his back on his evil brother Napoleon.

[(11:33)](#!):

So Lucien lived comfortably in England and then returned to France following the Restoration, but at the very end, he decided to support his brother during the Hundred Days, and so wound up prescribed by the Bourbons after Waterloo. Lucien is kind of like the opposite of Talleyrand, always managing to stay on the wrong side of the winners.

[(11:53)](#!):

The unraveling of the Napoleonic Empire began just after the Treaty of Tilsit was signed, and it began on the Iberian Peninsula. Trying to lock down the continental system, the French army invaded British-allied Portugal in November 1807, and once that invasion was complete, Napoleon then turned around and double-crossed the Spanish Bourbon monarchy. King Charles IV was forced to abdicate after spontaneous riots broke out in favor of his son Ferdinand. Ferdinand was elevated to the throne, and he turned to Napoleon for support, but Napoleon ousted him too, putting his own brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. The Spanish nobility pragmatically accepted this change, but the Spanish people really did not. So what followed was the Peninsular War, eight solid years of fighting between various French armies and Spanish guerrillas, and it’s where the term guerrilla was actually popularized. When Napoleon was around, the French seemed unbeatable, but whenever he left it all collapsed into chaos again. Dubbed by history the Spanish ulcer, the Peninsular Campaign drained money, men, material, and attention from Napoleon’s other projects. It also brought General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, to the main stage as he would lead the British forces in the Peninsular War, and would eventually be leading them right through the Pyrenees and into France itself.

[(13:17)](#!):

Meanwhile, Napoleon and Tsar Alexander held a further summit in 1808 in the German Principality of Erfurt, helpfully dubbed the Congress of Erfurt. Napoleon’s goal was to strengthen the bond the two emperors had forged at Tilsit and get Alexander to commit to the Continental System. Napoleon brought along Talleyrand despite their now mutual enmity, and this proved to be a huge mistake. Bringing the emperors back, Talleyrand initiated secret meetings with the Tsar and convinced Alexander that for the sake of a stable Europe he needed to reject Napoleon’s overtures. And that’s what the Tsar wound up doing. Napoleon never discovered that Talleyrand had betrayed him, and simply walked away shaking his head, unable to understand why Alexander had said no to a perfectly awesome deal to be one of the twin imperial pillars of the whole European continent.

[(14:10)](#!):

Rebuffed by Russia and with the Spanish ulcer still bleeding, Napoleon was then forced to go back to war with Austria in 1809. Believing that the time had come to set things back the way they should be, Emperor Francis I of now just Austria signed a new treaty with the British, creating the Fifth Coalition. The Austrians then launched a quick offensive to catch the French off guard, and Napoleon was dealt his first major defeat at the hands of our old friend Archduke Charles at Aspern Essling in May 1809, but the emperor managed to extract his army and come back around to smash the Austrians at Vagram in July, which was a battle waged between 154,000 men under Napoleon and 158,000 under Charles. Just for kicks, I went and looked up one of the great culminating battles of the Seven Years War, the last cycle of European wars before the Revolution. The Battle of Fribourg in 1762 pitted 22,000 Prussians against 27,000 Austrians. Napoleon’s victory at Vagram cost his army upwards of 37,000 casualties. The Austrians lost 30,000 to 40,000 men. So yeah, war is no longer a game of chess played by kings with small professional armies. It is now massive and total and horrible.

[(15:29)](#!):

After Vagram, the Austrians had to sign an incredibly harsh treaty that stripped them of even more land and forced them to now provide support and men for the French armies. Basically, Austria was now, like Prussia, merely a client kingdom of Emperor Napoleon. To seal this particular deal, Napoleon then made the very unpopular decision to divorce his wife Josephine, who had yet to bear him a child, and marry the Austrian princess Marie Louise, which, back in France, went over about as well as Louis XVI’s merit to Marie Antoinette. But in March 1811, she bore Napoleon a son who was promptly made King of Rome and heir to the imperial throne.

[(16:09)](#!):

Napoleon’s really real undoing came the following year.

[(16:14)](#!):

Angry that Tsar Alexander was not going along with the Continental System, Napoleon decided that a full-blown invasion of Russia was in order. The invasion is now justly infamous as a military and, frankly, humanitarian disaster. If I did it right, the invasion of Russia would be like a three or four episode arc, so let’s just do it now with some raw figures. No two sources seem to want to agree on the totals, but Napoleon led something like 450,000 men into Russia in June 1812. Five months later, after skirmishes and battles and attrition and scorched earth tactics by the Russians and the just horrible Russian winter, Napoleon retreated out of Russia at the head of less than 40,000 men. His army suffered 380,000 deaths in just five months. The Battle of Borodino alone accounted for more than 70,000 dead on both sides.

[(17:10)](#!):

Utterly decimated by the Russian invasion, and with the Spanish ulcers still bleeding, the walls started to close in on the emperor. But he is not going to go down without a fight. Over the winter of 1812-1813, both the French and Russians remobilized their armies. Now able to draw not just on France, but his whole empire, Napoleon was able to push his busted army stationed in Germany from a low of 30,000 back up to a high of 400,000 the following summer. But this is no longer the Grand Army of old, to say nothing of the fact that the sixth and final anti-French coalition would be the largest and most determined he would ever face. In the wake of the retreat from Russia, the Prussian component of the emperor’s army defected over to the Russians. When both sides had caught their breath and were back up and running the following year, the French faced a combined Russian-Prussian army at L\xc3\xbctzen and Bautzen in May 1813, and these battles saw upwards of 250,000 soldiers running around trying to kill each other and combine casualties north of 80,000. So the even worse horrors of World War I have tended to blot all of this out of our memories. But remember, the Napoleonic Wars, World War I before World War I was a twinkle in the Congress of Vienna’s eyes.

[(18:30)](#!):

A brief armistice followed in the summer of 1813, at which point the Austrians were induced to once again try to throw off the French yoke. But at Dresden at the end of August, Napoleon beat a combined Allied army of 214,000 with just 135,000 men, so he still got it, but he’s also now slipping backwards down a very icy slope.

[(18:51)](#!):

The year’s fighting culminated at the Battle of Leipzig in mid-October. Napoleon fielded 191,000 against three converging Allied armies numbering over 400,000. With basically every nationality in Europe represented at the battle, it is also sometimes referred to as the Battle of Nations. It was the single largest battle fought on European soil before World War I. It was also finally too much for Napoleon. He was beaten and forced to retreat back into France itself.

[(19:23)](#!):

While Napoleon was getting pushed out of Germany, the French forces in Spain were themselves getting pushed back, and Arthur Wellesley, now created the Duke of Wellington, was leading a combined Allied army through the Pyrenees. In his whole career, Napoleon had never had to fight inside of France, and now that was all that there was left for him to do.

[(19:44)](#!):

There was a moment, though, in November 1813 when this could all have turned out different. The anti-French coalition was as much worried about their partners as their common French enemy, and the Austrian foreign minister and master diplomat Metternich wanted to maintain a chastened but still stable France as a check against the Prussians and Austrians. And so he squeezed an agreement from the coalition to offer Napoleon the Frankfurt proposal. Napoleon would remain emperor, and the French borders would be marked at their natural frontiers that had been established in 1795. It was a generous offer, and Metternich told Napoleon, I don’t think it’s going to get any better. But Napoleon still thought he could win, and so he said no, and then in December the offer was rescinded.

[(20:32)](#!):

With a half million men invading France on all fronts, Napoleon then staged a pretty brilliant string of victories with just the 70,000 men he had left in February 1814, that was called the Six Days Campaign, but it was a hopeless effort. Napoleon belatedly said, I’ll take the Frankfurt proposal, but now the Allies said no, we have a new deal. You can still be emperor, but France goes back to its pre-1792 borders. Napoleon refused. In March 1814, the Allies took Paris almost without a fight.

[(21:04)](#!):

Talleyrand had by now been in cahoots with the Allies for quite a while, working to ensure that when Napoleon went down, as he surely would, that France would not be taken with him. Talleyrand convinced the Allies that the surest path to a stable France, and therefore a stable Europe, was to restore the Bourbons to power. In this, he had support from the British, though the Prussians favored the House of Orl\xc3\xa9ans, and the Austrians would have been happy running a regency surrounding young Napoleon II. Tsar Alexander, though, decided to go with Talleyrand and the British, and so the Bourbons got the call they had been waiting for for 20 years.

[(21:42)](#!):

When the Allies entered Paris, Talleyrand went to the Senate and told them it is time for the Emperor to go. He then brought in Tsar Alexander, who told the Senate that the Allies were fighting Napoleon, not France, and so the Senate passed the Emperor’s Demise Act, which deposed Napoleon. Then they formed a provisional government and elected Talleyrand president, the only time the old sneaky snake ever sat in the big chair. But don’t worry, it was only for a couple days, and by April 11th, the Senate had created a new constitution, a constitution with the restored Bourbon monarchy at its center. But those are all just words on paper, right?

[(22:22)](#!):

That’s sure what Napoleon thought. But when he started planning to march on Paris, his senior generals mutinied and said, we are not going to do it. Napoleon said, the armies will go where I tell them to. And Marshal Ney then famously replied, the army will follow its generals. With no one to carry out his orders, Napoleon gave up. On April 2nd, he abdicated in favor of his son, but that wasn’t good enough. And so on April 4th, 1814, Napoleon abdicated unconditionally.

[(22:56)](#!):

The victorious Allies met for a diplomatic summit at Vienna in September 1814 to redraw the map of post-Napoleonic post-French revolutionary Europe. The Congress of Vienna was Talleyrand’s moment to shine. Initially, the only powers with decision-making abilities were Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria, which makes perfect sense because those are the four powers that have just won the war. But Talleyrand, negotiating on behalf of the restored Bourbons, formed a coalition of lesser states and said, hey, these guys need a say too. So if you give me a seat at the table, I’ll make sure they don’t get left in the dust.

[(23:33)](#!):

Talleyrand then expertly played on the coalition partner spheres of each other, and he got France a seat at the table with decision-making powers. And instead of being partitioned and dismembered like some latter-day Poland, France was kept mostly intact, though it was now back to its pre-1792 borders. Then Talleyrand turned around and forged a secret pact with Britain and Prussia against Austria and Russia, breaking the anti-French coalition and putting France back on equal footing with the other great powers, despite having wrecked so much havoc and having been so thoroughly defeated. It’s one of the all-time great diplomatic achievements. And the stately quadrille danced on.

[(24:17)](#!):

But of course we know that there’s one final act left to play out. Exiled to the island of Elba off the Italian coast, Napoleon tried to commit suicide, but the pill he had been carrying around since Russia had lost its potency. When the Allies started reneging on promised funds to keep up his exile, and then rumors started floating around that they were going to deposit him in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Napoleon escaped from Elba on February 26, 1815. When he landed in France, the newly restored Bourbon monarchy sent an army to capture him. But when that army made contact with Napoleon, they all said, viva la emperor, and they all marched on Paris together.

[(24:56)](#!):

With this army on the move, the restored Bourbons fled the capital, and Napoleon reentered Paris on March 22, beginning the Hundred Days, Napoleon’s last window of imperial rule. But that window was closed almost exactly 200 years ago at Waterloo on June 18, 1815. After this great defeat, Napoleon abdicated again on June 22, and this time he was exiled to Saint Helena, a thousand miles off the coast of Africa, an island from which he could not escape.

[(25:28)](#!):

Napoleon Bonaparte had been First Consul for five years and Emperor for eleven. He ruled one of the largest empires of the modern world. He had taken France from the brink of defeat to total domination over Europe. He had reached phenomenal heights. His impact is still felt today. But after six years of dreary exile, Napoleon died broken and depressed in 1821.

[(25:54)](#!):

Napoleon’s resurgent aggression during the Hundred Days could have cost France a lot. But by the time he had escaped from Elba, almost all the detail work of the Congress of Vienna was done. All that was left to do was sign, and nobody wanted to reopen negotiations. So the balance of power thus forged at Vienna would hold up for a century. It also created the fault lines upon which World War I would be fought, since Prussia emerged the clear victor from the Congress of Vienna and was soon busy unifying Germany.

[(26:25)](#!):

Inside France, of course, the final defeat of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna meant that the Bourbons were finally back, twenty-three years after the Republic had been proclaimed by the National Convention in September 1792. Talleyrand stayed on as foreign minister for Louis XVIII, and the old survivor was surviving thanks to the seeds he had sown right after the fall of the Bastille. If you’ll recall, Talleyrand had told the Comte d’Artois, if you guys want to survive, you’re going to have to crack down on these revolutionaries fast and hard.

[(26:57)](#!):

Artois had agreed with this assessment, but Louis XVI had not. Artois then fled the country in July 1789, and when he finally returned to Paris in 1815, he could not deny that before he had done anything else, Talleyrand had once tried to save the monarchy from destruction. Though, Talleyrand would not last long in office. By the end of the year, he will be forced out of the ministry, and then spend the next 15 years exiled from public life, before being invited back to power by King Louis Philippe, marking the sixth different regime Talleyrand would serve in his long and sneaky and brilliant career. Everyone went into the restoration with something resembling hope. So much had changed, and so much of that change was cemented that it did not seem possible for the restored royal family to try and undo it. But it was later said that when the Bourbons came back, they forgot nothing and learned nothing. Some things they could not change. The centralized departmental structure remained in place, as did the Napoleonic Code. I mean, how could it not? It was working great. All Frenchmen were also considered equal before the law.

[(28:05)](#!):

But on the other hand, the king was also the supreme commander of the army and navy. He could make war and negotiate peace. He could sign commercial treaties with foreign powers, appoint public officials, and pretty much write domestic regulations and ordinances as he saw fit. As constitutional monarchies go, the restoration was heavy on the monarchy.

[(28:26)](#!):

Now Louis XVIII was personally fairly liberal and cautious with his new subjects, who had gotten pretty used to being citizens over the last twenty years. But when he died in 1824, his brother, the implacably counter-revolutionary Comte d’Artois, succeeded him as King Charles X. Six years later, the harsh conservatism of Charles would prove to be too much, and the July Revolution would overthrow him and invite to the throne King Louis Philippe, formerly the Duc d’Orl\xc3\xa9ans, the long-exiled son of Philippe Egalit\xc3\xa9.

[(28:59)](#!):

Styled now King of the French rather than King of France, King Louis Philippe would rule the July monarchy as a truly constitutional monarchy until it too was overthrown in the chaos of 1848. The restoration of the Bourbons in 1815 really, really closes the book on the great revolutionary cycle that began with the fall of the Bastille in 1789. Though we should all now know that the Revolution didn’t really start in July 1789. It really started in August 1786, when Controller General Colon told King Louis that the monarchy was stony broke.

[(29:38)](#!):

So if you ask me, the smaller epochs within the greater revolutionary epoch really breaks down August 1786 to July 1794, that’s the really revolutionary revolution. Then July 1794 to April 1804, call that the Termidorian Republic, and then April 1804 to June 1815, the Napoleonic Empire. But we are going to talk about all that during the final retrospective, which as I said will just be showing up in your feed at some random point. In the meantime, you can find me on Twitter at Mike Duncan so that you will be able to keep up with me in real time. But between now and then, I will have had a baby. So I am off to do that now.

Hello, and welcome to Revolutions. Episode 3.55, The Retrospective.

[(01:51)](#!):

So welcome to our one final look back at the French Revolution before we finally move on. What I’m looking to do here, as much for myself as for you guys, is to walk back through everything that we’ve covered to pull out what I consider to be the really important turning points so that we can trace a coherent line from the collapse of the ASEAN regime through the Napoleonic Empire and then the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. Now, one thing I noticed looking back through it all is that many of the events that I consider key turning points are actually pretty obscure and rarely show up in a general survey of the revolution because a good turning point sets up the really famous dramatic moments. By the time the really famous dramatic moments happen, the turning point has already done its work. This is one of the reasons I love really getting into the details because you get to grasp the secret scaffolding that holds more visible history up in place.

[(02:45)](#!):

So let’s start then with a broad framework. After having gone through the whole revolutionary period, I now know how I would divide up the era into discrete historical periods. Now, these kinds of divisions are, of course, arbitrary, but they do help keep things straight and are good building blocks for your broader understanding of world history.

[(03:06)](#!):

So ignoring all traditional dating conventions, here’s how I would break things up. The French Revolution began in August 1786 when Controller General Colon told the king that the monarchy was stony broke. This kicked off a chain reaction that led to the disintegration of the ASEAN regime. And where does the French Revolution end? Well, I am now prepared to say that it ends in July of 1794 with the Termidorian reaction and the fall of Robespierre.

[(03:34)](#!):

The French Revolution, running from 1786 to 1794, was defined by an almost uniform process of increasing radicalization. That is, at almost every crisis point, the more radical faction inevitably won. It started with the critics inside the assembly of notables who stood up to Colon, rather than just rubber stamping his reform package, and led all the way through to the reign of terror. During this process of persistent radicalization, the revolution devoured the hell out of its children as yesterday’s revolutionary fringe became today’s moderate leaders, became tomorrow’s reactionary conservatives. The revolutionary tide just rushed past everyone. And it wasn’t until late 1793 that this process of radicalization finally stalled out, and that was when the enrag\xc3\xa9s were defeated by Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety.

[(04:27)](#!):

The Termidorian reaction marks a fundamental break with the course and speed of events, to the point that I’m pretty comfortable saying that the French Revolution ends at Thermidor.

[(04:38)](#!):

But if the French Revolution proper ended in 1794, what comes next? So I call this next discreet period the Termidorian Republic, which runs from July 1794 to May 1804, and that was when First Consul Bonaparte became Emperor Napoleon the First. Unlike the revolution, the Termidorian Republic was defined not by a line of increasing radicalization, but by a center point that was attempting to wield power in opposition both to revolutionary leftists and counterrevolutionary royalists. As we saw, and we’ll review in a bit here today, the Directory tried to hold the center by alternatively whacking each side in turn, first left, then right, then left again, then right again. But this meant that the Directory never had a strong enough base of support to sustain it in the long run. Now, Talleyrand saw that the moment he returned from exile in the United States, and having deduced this, did what he could to make his own prediction come true. But that means that the midpoint of the Termidorian Republic is the Coup of 18 Brumaire, which saw Bonaparte overthrow the Directory, and replace it with the Consulate. Now, real life led me to cut off our cycle of episodes on the French Revolution at the Coup of Brumaire, which is, by the way, a very traditional place to mark the end of the French Revolution. But conceptually, the Termidorian Republic ends when First Consul Bonaparte becomes Emperor Napoleon the First. Because as we saw in those final episodes, the Consulate sewed up a lot of the loose threads that were unraveled at the beginning of the revolutionary era.

[(06:13)](#!):

So the Termidorian Republic is then obviously followed by the Napoleonic Empire, which runs from May 1804 to June 1815. The empire was defined by, duh, Napoleon, and all that goes with him. This was obviously beyond the scope of the show, but just so you know, the central pivot point is around 1808 with the decision to invade and occupy Spain, creating the bleeding ulcer that would help undo everything. It ends with Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna, and the restoration of the monarchy. So with this framework in place, let’s go back to the very beginning.

[(06:48)](#!):

We started this cycle of episodes on the French Revolution with an examination of the three estates that define the social, political, and economic structure of the Ancien Regime, and then moved into a discussion of the myriad fault lines that plagued France at the end of the 18th century. The kingdom was not in any way a unified kingdom, and it certainly wasn’t an absolute monarchy. It was a patchwork of provinces and parishes, jurisdictions, tax zones, free cities, none of which seemed to live by the same laws, and all of which claimed their own specific privileges and exemptions.

[(07:23)](#!):

If you were rich, you were able to buy your way out of most taxes, which is crazy and unsustainable, and left the lower classes to shoulder the burden of providing the state with revenue. What energy the revolution had from below was driven in the early days by an intense desire to abolish all of this crap and make things more equal and more just.

[(07:44)](#!):

Now the various royal ministries were not insensible to the problems tripping up the kingdom, nor that enlightened, modernizing reforms were probably the answer. But they faced determined resistance, not only from those who were privileged by the system, but also by those who were oppressed by it. Because remember, there were things like the Flower War in 1775. That was when hungry peasants revolted against the free market experiments of the physiocrats. Heading into the 1780s, it would have taken a leader with serious backbone to drive the Ancien Regime into the modern age. And Louis XVI was really, really not the man for the job.

[(08:25)](#!):

So that background brings us to the first really important turning point. And I know you probably think I’m gonna say Vergennes convincing the king to back the Americans, but I’m not. And while I think it was a crazy idea given the state of the kingdom’s finances, the problems were much wider and deeper than the American War of Independence. Instead, I’m going to talk about the massive covering up of the monarchy’s financial woes, the Comte Rondeau. Written by everyone’s favorite Swiss Protestant wonder boy, Jacques Necker, and published in 1781, this massive accounting of the royal finances was an unexpected bestseller, and it purported to show that the ministry was balancing its books just fine. But Necker was only able to make the numbers add up by shunting huge expenditures like war over to this category called extraordinary expenses that don’t really count. This bookkeeping sleight of hand convinced every literate Frenchman with an interest in public affairs that the monarchy was not only solvent, but it might actually be running a surplus here pretty soon. The Comte Rondeau planted a very misleading seed in everyone’s mind about the health of the state, and that seed would blossom fully into outrage disbelief when the monarchy announced just six years later that it was insolvent.

Now, the myth of the Comte Rondeau was, of course, exacerbated by Cologne’s program of useful splendor, basically keeping up appearances so that the financiers lending the regime money wouldn’t catch on to the fact that their money was probably going into a black hole. Now, Cologne hoped that somehow, in some way, they would be able to turn it all around before anyone caught on, but obviously that did not happen. In August 1786, it all fell apart. Cologne came to the king and said, “‘Sire, we have no money, “‘and we are going to need to drastically reform “’the kingdom’s political economy “‘if we’re going to survive.’” This, in my view, marks the beginning of the French Revolution.

[(10:24)](#!):

Now, traditionally, this period from 1786 to 1789 is called the pre-revolution, but to me, the pre-revolution is all the stuff happening in the transition from Louis XV to Louis XVI that set up the bankruptcy crisis of 1786. From the bankruptcy crisis forward, it is an unbroken chain of cause and effect leading all the way to the Reign of Terror. So, the next two years saw successive royal ministries battle first with the Assembly of Notables who refused to rubber-stamp Cologne’s reforms and then the parlomar, who refused to register the reforms, and both did so with tons of popular support.

[(11:03)](#!):

This all culminated in mid-1788 with the attempt to dissolve the parlomar, leading to the Day of the Tiles, which was the first good mob action of the revolution, which also gave full voice to the widespread demand that if the king wanted to levy new taxes, he had to call the Estates General. And when it was revealed in August 1788 that there was only 400,000 livre left in the royal treasury, the Estates General were finally called to meet in May 1789. And of course, I would be remiss if I did not mention that this breakdown of the French political economy was massively aggravated by a terrible run of recent harvests and the particularly bad winter of 1788-1789.

[(11:46)](#!):

So after the Estates General get called, things move quickly through the alleged good revolution of 1789 with all its dramatic set pieces, the tennis court oath, the fall of the Bastille, the Great Fear, the municipal revolution, the night of August the 4th, the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

[(12:03)](#!):

These events are the star attractions for any good telling of the French Revolution. And I’ll admit that I was absolutely giddy when I got to go inside the tennis court itself on the last revolutions tour. But none of these set pieces from the summer of 1789 are as truly decisive to the course of the revolution as the really big turning point that came in the fall of 1789. Because remember, by the end of summer, things appeared to be cooling down. Revolutionary fever was receding and probably leaving in its place a constitutional monarchy led by liberal nobles and wealthy bourgeoisie in partnership with a king whose powers were diminished but by no means abolished.

[(12:43)](#!):

But then came the women’s march on Versailles. After an inciting incident involving the king’s guard trampling the revolutionary cockade at a banquet at Versailles, a demonstration of Paris mothers and wives protesting bread shortages turned into a full blown march through the driving rain towards the royal palace.

[(13:04)](#!):

After a night of tense negotiations, somebody sympathetic to the demonstrators opened the palace gates and let them in. For a few moments, it looked like the royal family might get massacred. Marie Antoinette certainly spent the longest half hour of her life trapped next to a locked door trying to flee from the intruders. But the safety of the royal family was secured by a national guard company and the angry women were pushed back outside.

[(13:30)](#!):

So in the aftermath of this, Lafayette brokered a compromise that saw the royal family agree to relocate to Paris. And the move to Paris is huge. Not only did it put the revolution at the mercy of the streets of Paris, which is obviously a gigantic deal, but more immediately, it polarized the delegates of the National Assembly. In Versailles, the delegates had lodged with the men from their own provincial delegations because that was who they had come with and the only men they knew. But when they moved to Paris, they all clustered by ideology, not geography. Men now spent their time amongst those who they agreed with. And the division between left and right, physically demarcated inside the rectangular menage of the Tuileries Palace, was born. And then of course, yes, over in the Court de Lis district, a whole radical faction, not even in the National Assembly, started making some pretty crazy noises.

[(14:24)](#!):

The revolution moving to Paris is a huge turning point. More so, much more so, than the fall of the Bastille itself, despite what the revolution’s PR department would like you to believe.

[(14:38)](#!):

But despite the undercurrent of polarization, the whole first half of 1790 seemed once again to be leading towards a stable constitutional order. The king was publicly on board with playing the part of citizen king. The liberal nobles, now led by Lafayette in his society of 1789, held the reins of government. The church was being reorganized as a national institution, and its lands were being used to pay off the monarchy’s debts. But this was all in line with complaints from the parish priests, who were annoyed about the clique of high ecclesiastics who had been hoarding church property. So the vast majority of the priests weren’t mad about the reforms to the church, they positively welcomed them. So when the great celebration was held on the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, this is when Talleyrand administers this patriotic oath to Lafayette, it once again appeared like the revolution was winding down.

[(15:30)](#!):

But of course we know that everyone was just biding their time behind the scenes, and no one was truly committed to the new order. The more radical leaders wanted the revolution to go even further, while the conservatives believed that they would be able to slowly wind everything back now that the heat was off. And at the end of 1790 though, we get our next critical turning point, and one that can only be described as a major mistake, the civic oath.

[(15:56)](#!):

The more radically inclined members of the National Assembly demanded the clergy swear an oath of loyalty to the state above the church. And overnight, this civic oath alienated a ton of the devout parish priests, who thus far had been on board even with the reorganization of the French church. Their mass disembarking from the revolution massively undercut the revolution’s legitimacy, and created a stable network of counter-revolutionary opposition that would plague the republic until Bonaparte broke out the Concordat of 1801. Who knows what would have happened had the revolutionaries in Paris not been so obsessed with the civic oath. The Vend\xc3\xa9e would not have happened for sure, and that alone changes practically everything.

[(16:39)](#!):

The civic oath, big deal, bad idea.

[(16:44)](#!):

The next great turning point comes in May 1791, and is usually passed over completely, unless you’re talking specifically about Robespierre, because it’s his first major contribution to the revolution. As the National Assembly continued to plug away on the coming constitution of 1791, Robespierre convinced his colleagues to pass what? That self-denying decree, with the National Assembly delegates voluntarily barring themselves from serving in the coming legislative assembly. So when the legislative assembly was inaugurated that October, none of the men who had a vested interest in the success of the constitution of 1791 were around. And not only that, they were replaced by more obscure local leaders who had just spent the last two years cutting their revolutionary teeth as critics and rabble-rousers. The refined gentility of the National Assembly gave way to the more raucous and self-consciously revolutionary legislative assembly.

[(17:44)](#!):

And of course, in between the self-denying ordinance and the legislative assembly and what made the revolutionary assembly even more raucously and self-consciously revolutionary was the king’s flight to Varennes, which devastated trust in the monarchy and really let loose fears of a royalist plot to invite the Austrians in to crush them all. The respectable revolutionaries of the liberal noble variety were then forced to confront a more radically egalitarian and now avowedly republican force coming out of the Corleu district. It is tough to say whether these more respectable revolutionaries who were personified by the constitutional monarchists in the FUNA Club would have been able to keep things on course had they transitioned into controlling the legislative assembly. But I cannot imagine things would have spiraled out of control quite so fast had power not been handed to Brissot and his Girondin colleagues who immediately started beating the drums of war.

[(18:42)](#!):

So since the onset of the war is the really big central pivot point of the French Revolution, let’s stop for a minute and review the international situation. As you will recall, we have our five major powers, France, Austria, Prussia, Britain, and Russia. In terms of the international balance of power, the really shocking event that put everyone on notice that France was actually in deep trouble was when Prussia marched into the United Provinces in 1787 and France was too broke to lift a finger. Suddenly the leaders of all the other powers were like, ho ho, France is weak, how can we exploit this? But then, and this is the big deal, the answer was emphatically not let’s declare war on France. The answer was let’s kick back and have a drink and watch France burn and then divide up the remains.

[(19:34)](#!):

So as paranoid as the revolutionaries were about a foreign invasion, particularly by the Austrians, the other powers in Europe had almost no interest in war. It wasn’t until three years after the fall of the Bastille that war was actually declared and when it came, it was driven by the French, not by the Austrians. And the mistake that the other powers made, and by that I mean the Austrians and the Prussians, was in thinking that belligerent threats would strengthen political moderates inside France and that that would stave off war, when in point of fact it paved the way for aggressively nationalistic leaders to grab the reins and declare war.

[(20:12)](#!):

What the other powers wanted was a French monarchy weakened by revolutionary constraints and unable to resist or interfere with the power plays of everyone else. What they did instead was provoke a war that led directly to the rise of Napoleon and then him conquering them a decade later. Whoops.

[(20:33)](#!):

So the single most decisive turning point in the course of the French Revolution is the declaration of war on Austria in April 1792. You can actually pinpoint it even more specifically. It’s April the 28th, 1792. That was the day Colonel Arthur Dillon led an initial skirmishing action against the Austrians near the Belgian frontier, which turned into a disorganized retreat in the face of Austrian artillery. Now the Girondin orators had whipped up war fever over the winter by promising quick and easy victory over the decaying Austrians, and the reality of military hardship was a bucket full of cold water. But instead of accepting that war is hard, Briseau and the boys launched into full-blown conspiratorial paranoia, saying that there were secret counter-revolutionary and foreign agents everywhere, and who were intentionally causing our armies to lose. Now a few speeches from a few guys is obviously not enough to invent bloodthirsty paranoia out of whole cloth, so the conditions were obviously there. But rather than reining those impulses in, the Girondins let it off the leash. And boy, did bloodthirsty paranoia get off the leash.

[(21:47)](#!):

You can see a very clear separation in the revolution’s body count right here in the spring of 1792, because even though there have been major demonstrations, mob uprisings, really bitter political battles, what’s been the result? Well, let’s go to the board. The day of the tiles and the other street clashes over the May edicts in 1788, some property damage, some injuries, handful of dead, fall of the Bastille, well, scores of dead demonstrators, a few soldiers killed in the siege, a very gruesome end for the governor, and then the intended and his son got lynched a few days later, but really, that’s it.

[(22:25)](#!):

The great fear that swept the countryside in the aftermath of the fall of the Bastille, the state’s ransacked, records burned, but this was always after pushing the noble families aside, not hacking them to pieces with rusty sickles. The women’s march on Versailles, I mean, maybe that could have gotten out of hand, but it didn’t. The National Guard secured the royal family. There was only a few dead in the skirmishing around the royal apartments. The demonstrations surrounding the flight to Varennes, lots of ominous loitering, no actual action. And then finally, the massacre of the Champs de Mars, which, first of all, there was only about 50 dead max, and second, all of those were on the side of the Republican radicals. So when we add up all the bodies, the vast majority are, first of all, from the revolutionary side, and second of all, there aren’t that many of them. The id of the revolution was obviously in check until the war.

[(23:20)](#!):

After the war begins, and then really, once it starts to go bad, holy crap, look out. The insurrection of August the 10th was armed and merciless. You get the massacre of the Swiss guards of the Tuileries Palace, the systematic hunting down and hacking to death of defeated soldiers, and then you get the September massacres a month later, which are the first really freakishly murderous thing the French Revolution got up to, with its kangaroo tribunals and men, women, and children being pushed into alleyways to face indiscriminate butchering. 1,500 dead in less than a week, and why? Because of the war, a foreign army was marching on Paris, and it’s just gonna be like this right into 1793 and the Reign of Terror. Time and again, we see a direct link between bad news on the various war fronts and a rise in revolutionary butchery. When the bad news gave way to better news, the butchery slowed down. And of course, we’ve already seen how the majority of the official victims of the Reign of Terror came from cities that had risen in revolt against Paris and were now being subdued and punished. The war, the war changed everything. The war defined revolutionary terror. The war created revolutionary terror.

[(24:39)](#!):

So besides the terror, the other really big result of this big turning point called the war is a little thing called the overthrow of the monarchy on August the 10th, 1792, which marks the beginning of what some people like to call the second French Revolution. And I do like that formulation. August the 10th was the first out-and-out planned revolutionary insurrection. It’s when the Paris Commune seizes control of the revolution. The character and characters of the revolution change dramatically from this point on. The first revolution was aristocratic, elitist and moderate. The second was populist, egalitarian and radical. The first revolution was by the Culottes. The second revolution was by the Saint-Culottes. And as we just discussed, the first revolution was relatively bloodless as far as revolutions go. The second revolution was a bloody terror. The first revolution was enlightened pamphlets like What is the Third Estate by the ABCS. The second revolution was whatever homicidal propaganda Marat happened to be scribbling on any given day. The first revolution was Lafayette and the National Guard. The second was Vadier and the Revolutionary Army. The first revolution was for a constitutional monarchy. The second was for a republic. I could go on, but I like this distinction.

[(26:01)](#!):

So the first wave of revolutionary killing in the second revolution subsided after the surprise victory at Valmy. And this victory gave the newly inaugurated National Convention the space it needed to descend into an incredibly bitter and not entirely explicable blood feud between the Girondins and the Mountain, who used the trial of the king as their first field of battle. The Mountain won, of course, and poor Louis, who was just not the man for the job, got his head chopped off.

[(26:30)](#!):

Now, in a casual telling of the French Revolution, the murder of the king will always be a decisive event, especially because it convinced the other monarchies of Europe to declare war on revolutionary France. But we have a more nuanced understanding, don’t we? Because we know that Austria and Prussia are already at war with France. Russia won’t get into it for another five years. And so of the five major powers, we’re only really talking about the British. And while the death of the king did finally sever diplomatic relations, it was really the fact that Du Maurier had pushed the French armies into Belgium and was threatening the United Provinces that really got the British into the war. Dead king, live king, whichever, mess with British hegemony in the Netherlands, and they are going to want to fight you.

[(27:17)](#!):

So in the spring of 1793, the powers of Europe were united against Republican France. And that is when the convention issued the decree that blew up the home front. Remember what it was? The next big turning point, the LaVey of 300,000.

[(27:33)](#!):

Resistance to this draft was acute and widespread. It created anger and resentment and hostility across France, sowing the seeds of the coming Federalist revolt. And of course, it was the LaVey of 300,000 that provided the spark that blew up the Vend\xc3\xa9e into a towering inferno. Resistance to the draft created a parallel domestic crisis to match the foreign crisis of Europe uniting against the French. And since defeating and punishing those domestic insurrections is what the reign of terror was all about, the LaVey of 300,000 takes on an even greater significance.

[(28:10)](#!):

Now, I’ve cracked a few jokes about how long it took us to get through 1793. By my count, we nosed into the year in episode 3.26 with the execution of Louis and did not escape it for 11 full episodes, finally leaving it behind in episode 3.36. It’s the craziest damn year I’ve ever seen. It started with the French army under De Maurier getting beat and then him defecting, leaving the road to Paris seemingly clear. But with the Vend\xc3\xa9e erupting and the Federalist revolt in full swing, the Allied response was quite justifiably to let Republican France collapse all on its own. But somehow, that’s not what happened. The Committee of Public Safety was created and then reorganized itself into a strident and self-confident dictatorship. The LaVey en masse was formulated and started to work. The Federalist revolt turned out to be less powerful than its leaders had hoped. And soon, only Lyon was holding out. The Catholic and royal army was still marching around in the West, but their commanders were not unified, and they had no stable pipeline of arms or support. And it was too late that the Allies realized that the French Republic was not, in point of fact, about to collapse.

[(29:25)](#!):

All of this came to a head in October 1793, which is the craziest damn month of the craziest damn year. It was a month of resolution, bloody, bloody resolution. And here’s just some of the stuff that happened in the span of that single critical month. The queen was put on trial and executed. The popular and democratic constitution of 1793 was permanently suspended without ever taking effect. Lyon fell, ending the Federalist revolt and giving the Reign of Terror its first major batch of victims. The Catholic and royal army was defeated in the West, and its survivors ran off to try to find the British. But that little adventure came to nothing. The Republican victory in the Vend\xc3\xa9e set up the other great center of the Reign of Terror. And just as an aside, you’ll get a lot of different dates out there about when the Reign of Terror actually starts. Some going all the way back to the execution of Louis, others when the guillotine was introduced in the spring. But the Reign of Terror starts here in October 1793, because this is when legal formalities are absolutely tossed aside and the mass executions really get going. Exemplified, of course, by the show trial and execution of the Girondins, which also took place in October 1793. And then finally, out on the Belgian frontier, the French beat the Austrians, leaving the French republic heading into the winter with victory on all fronts. October 1793, there is a whole book in that month.

[(30:57)](#!):

This snatching of victory from the jaws of defeat thoroughly legitimized the power and authority of the Committee of Public Safety. And they cemented it with the Law of Free Mayor, which gave them basically total authority over everything.

[(31:10)](#!):

But outside the committee, the group led by Danton started calling for a drawback from the Reign of Terror now that the crisis had passed, while the group surrounding Jacques Hebert wanted it to go even further. And they were now mixing in with it aggressive de-Christianization. Between these two groups stood Robespierre, who was for that moment in agreement with Danton and his indulgence rather than Hebert and the Ultras. But the East India scandal really seems to have soured Robespierre on Danton. And of course, in Robespierre’s mind, everyone was a part of some insidious foreign plot to undermine the republic. And this is also technically the moment when the revolution stops persistently radicalizing, as the first victims of the Committee of Public Safety’s new authority were the Enrag\xc3\xa9s. And then the first victims of Robespierre’s terror were Hebert and the Ultras.

[(32:03)](#!):

So the next great turning point comes in February 1794 and is a bit speculative on my part. But I still think we need to talk about it.

[(32:14)](#!):

Robespierre got sick, and he disappeared for a month. And I am not above believing that he had some kind of nervous breakdown. Robespierre was a workaholic. He kept insane hours. He rarely slept. And at that moment, he probably felt like the survival of the republic was resting on his tiny shoulders. Now, I want to be really clear about this, that this is all pure conjecture on my part based on little more than historical rumor. But when he emerges from this sickness, whatever it was, the careful, calculating Robespierre who cut with a scalpel was gone. And I mean that seriously. There was, for example, enormous pressure on the Committee of Public Safety to round up hundreds of alleged sympathizers when the Girondins were put on trial, and Robespierre quashed the attempt and insisted that they stick with the short list of named victims.

[(33:05)](#!):

After he emerges from his sickbed in March 1794, Robespierre, a revolutionary surgeon, is replaced by Captain Guillotine of Severed Head Mountain, who also happens to believe that he is the high priest of a death cult of the Supreme Being. First, he liquidated the ultras. Then he turned on Danton and liquidated the old Cordell Yee gang. And this was the beginning of the great terror. But remember, there was always a tight link between revolutionary mass killing and the course of the war. And as Robespierre was getting going on his great terror in the spring of 1794, the domestic situation was calm. And out on the frontier, another victory by the French army had led the Austrians to evacuate Belgium. The British had already failed to take Dunkirk, and they were pulling back to Holland. Prussia wanted out of the war. Spain wanted out of the war. So the disconnect between the terror in Paris and the relative calm everywhere else became very noticeable. And everybody got very nervous about Robespierre.

[(34:07)](#!):

So with everyone super paranoid about Robespierre, and rightfully so, a mismatched coalition of Robespierre’s enemies conspired to bring him down. And they pulled it off in July 1794. And I pretty much now think that that ends the French Revolution.

[(34:23)](#!):

This is going to be followed by a new historical chapter that played by a different set of rules with a different set of aims. And like I said, it was defined by this little circumscribed center trying to stave off challenges from both the left and the right, rather than a barreling locomotive of pure revolution that had really defined everything from the assembly of notables through the war with the parliament, the estates general, the National Assembly, the Legislative Assembly, and then the convention and the dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety.

[(34:54)](#!):

The French Revolution began with an attempt to reform the finances of the monarchy. It led instead to the total destruction of the Ancien regime, the establishment of a revolutionary republic that was ostensibly democratic and equalitarian, and which clearly ran on the blood of tyrants. After Thermidor, the object is not to push the revolution further, but to draw back from it as safely as possible, to hold on to the positive gains that had been made while ditching the fear and paranoia and belief that the Republic of Virtue was just around the corner just as soon as we murder everybody.

[(35:33)](#!):

But it was a tough trick to turn, as counter-revolutionary royalists were always looking for their chance to strike. And if there’s one thing the Thermidorians were not going to give up on, one of the truly positive gains they believe had been made, it was the republic itself. So the Directory was defined by these alternating strikes against first the left and then the right as they tried to hold on to power from the center. And in total, I count five of these focused swings over the next few years.

[(36:04)](#!):

The first of these was obviously the move against the left after Thermidor. The Muscadins were set out to work on the Jacobins. The reaction to this were the failed insurrections of Prairial and Florial, which finally buried the Sanquilat for good, and which in turn led to the White Terror of 1795, which is always described as a royalist action, but it’s best understood as victims of the terror taking revenge on their abusers.

[(36:30)](#!):

The second swing was when it was time to implement the Directory. The Thermidorians had drafted a new constitution that returned to the more elitist principles of the Constitution of 1791. And also, just as an aside, this is the moment when you really start seeing a rewriting of the revolutionary narrative and the first attempt to distinguish between the good revolution of 1789 and the bad revolution of 1792. The Federalist revolt, for example, was now recast as a noble struggle against the madmen who had seized control of Paris.

[(37:02)](#!):

Of course, we know that the Thermidorians had learned from the self-denying mistake of the National Assembly, a mistake that possibly destroyed the good revolution of 1789. So they passed that law of 2-thirds that legally kept 2-thirds of them in power, which triggered the uprising of Van de Meer by angry conservatives who thought that they were about to become a major force in the new government. Forced now to confront the threat from the right, they sent in young Bonaparte, who unleashed his whiff of grape shot.

[(37:32)](#!):

After defeating this insurrection from the right, the Directory was inaugurated and tried to make common cause with all men of Republican values. And so the left was coaxed out of the shadows. The Neo-Jacobean Pantheon Club was formed. And Gracchus Babboef got going with his conspiracy of equals. But it became clear that many of the Neo-Jacobeans didn’t want to become a loyal opposition inside the government. They wanted to overthrow it. And so the Directory had to make its third focus swing back to smack down the left again, close the Pantheon Club, and dismantle Babboef’s conspiracy of equals.

[(38:10)](#!):

But then, of course, you got to go back to the right. Because after the failure of the insurrection of Van de Meer, and then really after the failure of the Quiberon Bay expedition, the conservatives decided their only chance to win was at the ballot box. So the elections of year five swept a bunch of conservatives and closet royalists into the government. After trying to make it work over the summer of 1796, the Directory said, screw it. Made its fourth swing back against the right, states the coup of Fructidor, which purged the Directory of all its conservative members. This inaugurated the so-called Second Directory, which was more nakedly anti-democratic and authoritarian than its predecessor had been.

[(38:51)](#!):

The directorial terror that followed was then aimed at both the left and the right, as anyone caught advocating the mutually exclusive calls for either the return of the monarchy or the return of the Constitution of 1793 would be guilty of treason. But above all, it was aimed at the clergy, who were still operating as a permanent opposition. Now, the fifth and final swing came in the spring of 1797 with the rigging of the elections of year six and the pre-purging of left-wing candidates. So it seems kind of crazy that the Directory was able to hold on to power this long while so many active enemies from across the political spectrum were trying to kill it.

[(39:33)](#!):

But the Directory was backed by two really critical groups who helped ensure its survival, a wealthy bourgeoisie who had made a killing in land speculation and the army. But right after the coup of Fructidor, the Directory badly undermined the support of the former, even as it probably saved itself from financial ruin. So by far, the most important thing to come out of the second Directory and a major turning point in the transition from republic to empire were the financial reforms of Finance Minister Rommel. First, he outright repudiated 2-thirds of the national debt and then restructured the rest on very favorable terms for the state. This, coupled with his introduction of a bunch of new excise taxes and the creation of a pretty efficient central revenue office, he put the republic back on sound financial footing. But this slate of programs alienated the regime from the money guys who had been speculating in national lands and who had lent the regime money and who were now being told, nah, those bonds are all worthless.

[(40:42)](#!):

And the people for sure did not like the return of all the excise taxes that had literally helped spark the revolution in the first place. So Rommel and his reforms are at the heart of the transition from republic to empire because, first, it made the directorial regime very unpopular, unpopular enough that toppling it seemed like a good idea to men who could actually pull it off. And B, when Bonaparte came to power, he inherited a state in very good financial shape rather than one in shambles like every other new government. Rommel’s debt restructuring and revenue reforms were a very, very big deal.

[(41:20)](#!):

But of course, the other thing that was helping keep the Directory in power was continued success on the war front. And one of the big reasons, for example, that the directorial terror was hardly a terror at all was because it was against the backdrop of sustained military success. During the revolutionary period, France had constantly been on the brink of defeat and was defended by these hordes of enthusiastic volunteers who were just able to stave off annihilation.

[(41:49)](#!):

But as we just saw, by 1794, the good results of the lev\xc3\xa9 en masse were kicking in. The armies were better organized, and the resources of France were at their primary disposal. The Allies started to get beat, and then they started to lose interest. Prussia and Spain would both sign treaties withdrawing from the conflict in 1795. Britain would soon be withdrawing ground forces from the continent entirely, leaving Austria as the only major opponent left. The good news on the war front is what made the shift from chaotic radicalization to stabilizing moderation possible.

[(42:29)](#!):

So then, of course, General Bonaparte comes along, and he starts delivering not just victory but conquest. All those sister republics now being set up helped subsidize the French state, because after being liberated from the chains of medieval tyranny, these sister republics were pumped mercilessly for cash and prizes by the occupying French forces.

[(42:49)](#!):

The Directory’s inability to keep its army paid, fed, and clothed had led to this explicit policy of the war feeding itself. Now, this was a practical necessity, but it also helped transform the French military into a politically autonomous unit within the republic and created a cadre of officers and enlisted men who shared a professional esprit de corps and a loyalty to themselves and their generals that superseded whatever vague sense of duty they might owe to the politicians back in Paris. And this, too, really helps lay the groundwork for Napoleon’s empire.

[(43:25)](#!):

The victory over the Austrians was, of course, a really big deal. And it freed up Bonaparte and the French to start dreaming even bigger dreams, leading to our next major turning point, Bonaparte’s invasion of Egypt. Now, the Egyptian expedition itself was obviously a crazy adventure. But the more critical impact was in provoking the rest of Europe back to war.

[(43:50)](#!):

After Campo Formio, the only power left facing France was Britain. And they were staying off the continental mainland. But when Bonaparte landed in Alexandria, the rest of Europe freaked out. The Russians and Ottomans joined the war. The Austrians abandoned Campo Formio and joined up, too. The War of the Second Coalition then started out very badly for the French, which delegitimized the directorial regime in the eyes of two key groups. First, a click of civilian leaders in Paris, who had always been looking for a chance to overthrow the regime. And then, much more importantly, in the army itself, who believed the Directory had left them under-supplied, under-armed, and set up to fail. The support of the army had been the key to the Directory’s survival. The disastrous beginning to the War of the Second Coalition removed that support. And of course, it also provided Bonaparte with the opportunity to come home and save the day, even though the Egyptian expedition was both a failure in itself and had been the principal cause of the war starting back up in the first place.

Now, we ended the whole show, of course, with the Coup of 18 Brumaire that overthrew the Directory and inaugurated the Consulate. And though that wound up being the end point, I now believe that the Coup of Brumaire is actually a midpoint, dividing the era of the Termidorian Republic in two, on one side the Directory, on the other, Bonaparte’s Consulate.

[(45:18)](#!):

And as I hopefully was able to explain in that penultimate episode about the Consulate, Bonaparte was able to wrap up a lot of what had been left over from the revolutionary chaos. The Consulate cemented many of the major reforms that had been made and then fulfilled one of the dreams that was a uniform set of laws with the promulgation of the Napoleonic Code. The wars were finally ended, if only for a single year of peace. And then Bonaparte signed the Concordant with the pope that finally, finally healed the revolution’s religious bleeding ulcer. Now, First Consul Bonaparte was also a major proponent of incorporating elements of both the left and the right into his regime to create a much broader base of political support, or more precisely, to narrow the base of political opposition. Instead of the Directory’s whirling dervish approach to political opposition, Bonaparte invited the emigres to come home, though he also made them swear not to lay hereditary claim to their old estates. If they wanted those lands back, they could buy them, but they could not just have them. Bonaparte’s more subtle and welcoming approach helped him build the foundation of an imperial regime that found a home both for constitutional monarchists, just replace king with emperor, and enlightened republicans.

Now, running through the Consulate era, it’s an almost uniform string of successful policies and wise decisions, except in one major area that we are about to talk a whole lot about, because First Consul Bonaparte got it in his head to make France the predominant power in the New World and to rule a super strong colonial empire in the Caribbean and in North America, having recently come into possession of the old Spanish claims to what we call the Louisiana Territory.

[(47:10)](#!):

So instead of working with and legitimizing the rule of Toussaint Louverture, the ex-slave who now ruled the French colony of Saint-Domingue, Bonaparte tried to overthrow him and return the colony to direct rule from Paris. In his own memoirs written while in exile, Napoleon reckoned this was one of the worst mistakes he ever made. But aside from that, the Consulate was so successful on all fronts that the transition to empire in 1804 was made seamlessly and without major opposition. And that kicked off the Napoleonic Empire, which is now well beyond the scope of our show. And after a decade of conquering Europe and then losing it bit by bit, Napoleon was driven into exile, and the Bourbons came back.

[(47:58)](#!):

So that leaves us with one final question. What did the Revolution achieve? In 1815, the monarchy was back, yes. But France had been permanently altered by the course of the last 30 years, right? And even the reactionary Bourbons could not turn the clock back on everything. So what remained?

[(48:19)](#!):

Well, first of all, you have this incredible rationalization of the political administration. No one was going back to the insane quilt of overlapping jurisdictions and privileges that had defined the Ancien regime. The departments were here to stay. Centralized power was here to stay. One nation run by a single set of laws with the exact same taxes and regulations for everyone.

[(48:43)](#!):

France was just dramatically rationalized during the Revolution, and none of it was going anywhere. Also here to stay were the cohort of bourgeois bureaucrats who had formed a pretty solid administrative apparatus over the course of the Termidorian Republic and the Napoleonic Empire and were just too effective to get rid of. At the start of the Revolution, there were about 700 guys who made up the central administration of the kingdom. That number was now 6,000. And across France, there were a good 250,000 professional bureaucrats running the show. Promotions were based on merit, and they had no space for dilettante nobles trying to shove their way back into control, not that the nobility even wanted to after the Revolution.

[(49:30)](#!):

Now, of course, the abolition of feudalism and noble privilege was a major feature of the Revolution, and it was pretty well maintained after the Restoration. But it’s also important to note that the old nobility that had allegedly forfeited a ton of land during the Revolution actually had quite a lot of it back by the time of the Restoration. But though the reacquisition of land by the nobility returned title holdings back to something resembling the 1780s and that, in total, collective land redistribution by the Revolution was not nearly as big as you’d think, even the reactionary Bourbons considered it too dangerous to actually re-confiscate land that had been bought during the Revolution. They gave back what unsold national property they had, but the legitimacy of the loss of ancestral lands was tacitly conceded. Old feudal claims counted for nothing.

[(50:23)](#!):

But another major result of the Revolution was that this returned and still quite wealthy nobility pretty much retired from politics, safer to hunt and play cards and leave the grubby business of political administration to the commoners. Now, the one institution that was permanently stripped of its land was the Church. On the eve of the Revolution, they owned 10% of the country. That land was all nationalized and sold off, and Bonaparte made it explicit in the Concordat of 1801 that the Church was not getting any of that land back under any circumstances. The French Catholic Church took a major, major hit in terms of its power and prestige.

[(51:06)](#!):

Now, economically, the Revolution had been a total disaster and created almost no lasting improvements. International trade had been devastated and led to the collapse of the economic powers of Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux, which had a lot more to do with triggering the Federalist revolt than, say, the actual set piece drama of The Purge of the Girondins. Despite all the enlightened ideas for economic reform floating around out there, all of it kind of came to naught. All the free market experiments failed because conditions were never right to actually get it going, and then the command and control measures of the general maximum were just utterly destructive. Until Napoleon’s conquest of Europe gave the French economy something to feed on and sell to again, I mean, things were just awful. There was almost nothing that can be pointed to as an economic advancement that was made during the Revolution. Aside from the abolition of the internal tariff barriers, which were ditched almost immediately and never came back, I mean, there’s nothing. Economically speaking, the Revolution was terrible, and had to end before things could improve.

[(52:13)](#!):

Now, speaking of Napoleon’s conquests of Europe, though, one group that majorly advanced during the era was the French military, who clearly had gone from a bastion of ancient privilege resisting with all its might the pull of modernity into a rocket ship of military innovation. The Revolutionary Wars transformed the conduct of warfare in Europe, from kings playing chess with mercenaries, to entire nations fully mobilizing on a huge scale. Technologically, strategically, tactically, logistically, armed conflict was just a whole different and far more destructive ball of wax than it had been before the Revolution, and there was no putting the genie back in that particular bottle.

[(52:56)](#!):

From a larger psychological perspective, though, things like the La V\xc3\xa9on mass and the total national mobilization for war finally did accomplish what the early revolutionaries had dreamed of, creating a single unified French nation, no longer divided by old cultural and linguistic barriers, but instead one single equal people. The Revolution was nuts for flags and symbols and uniforms, songs, calendars, oaths, all of it designed to kind of invent from scratch a nation of citizens, where once a patchwork kingdom of subjects had existed.

[(53:33)](#!):

And in this, the Revolution was decisive to creating the modern nation-state. France is France because of the French Revolution, and the thing that will lead the Bourbon Restoration to collapse just 15 years after it started was that they were acting like they still governed a kingdom of subjects rather than a nation of citizens.

[(53:52)](#!):

Napoleon had been careful to say that his imperial authority came from the sovereignty of the people. Louis XVIII came back and said his authority came from God and that the new constitution was a benevolent gift to his subjects. This was, in the end, fundamentally incompatible with the new sense of national identity. And when King Louis Philippe took the crown, he was king of the French, whose authority was bestowed upon him by the citizens he led.

[(54:27)](#!):

So with all of that said, I think it’s time to move on. The French Revolution has been an endlessly fascinating ride, and I hope that you all got as much out of listening to it as I got out of producing it. It is, however, with some degree of relief that we finally set it aside and move on to the Haitian Revolution, which, oh, wait a second, means going right back and reliving this all again, except from the perspective of the fabulously lucrative French colony in Saint-Domingue, who will descend into a parallel revolution once everyone gets their hands on the lofty Declaration of the Rights of Man and starts reading into it what they want, like, for example, the slaves, who think it means that they ought to be free.
