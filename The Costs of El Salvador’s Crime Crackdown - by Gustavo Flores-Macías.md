## Reading Notes

> There are alternatives to the Bukele model for reducing crime. In cities in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, politicians have managed to decrease homicides without eroding civil and human rights by making sustained investments in democratic policing, which emphasizes transparency, accountability, and civil liberties. These measures may not work as quickly, and they may not be as conspicuous.

I wonder how effective these other measures are relatively, even in the long time-horizon.

>  Officials in countries including Mexico and Brazil have shelled out millions in consultancy fees for the advice of former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on crime-fighting techniques, with few discernible long-term results

LOL!

> Addressing impunity requires more, rather than less, transparency and accountability

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=8&selection=6,25,7,37|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 8]]

I understand the principle of this and the cautionary tale he is presenting, but how do you square the expediency that is seemingly necessary in handling these gangs with the bureaucratic overhead that transparency and accountability typically brings?

> Officials must invest more in civilian policing agencies to incentivize good and effective police behavior…

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=8&selection=56,47,62,7|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 8]]

This suggestion requires more capital diverted to police institutions. Makes sense, but could be infeasible for a state overtaken by gang violence. If the current government can be trusted, maybe the claim is that they can “restore order” and then the more functional and productive society can more easily sustain an effective police force (and also reduce the relative value of gang membership, thereby making gangs less powerful). I’m curious how the US solved corrupt policing issues from the Prohibition Era.

> the city made a sustained effort to expand its \[Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl’s\] local police force and strengthen trust in local law enforcement

How do you go about strengthening trust?

> Despite their effectiveness at the local level, such alternative policing methods have not gained national traction because they are eclipsed by flashy and politically expedient iron-fist approaches

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=9&selection=102,0,110,13|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 9]]

I’d also imagine these methods don’t scale as well to the national level — you can spread that (tax) burden of fixing a single city onto the entire national population, but of course this won’t be the case if it’s a national problem.

>  Given the popularity of the visible deployment of the armed forces from one emergency to the next, resources are channeled toward military budgets rather than to less sexy but crucial reforms to civilian police and the judiciary

Seeing how using the army is so obviously the easy answer (literally a bunch of people with guns and nothing else to do), it makes me wonder what these countries even have a military for at this point lol. Is it insane to try and demilitarize your country (perhaps move to make the army a civilian force)? In the region, Costa Rica and Panama apparently doesn’t have a standing army, maybe that’s playable for others?

## Thoughts

Didn’t really learn much new things about the El Salvador situation, despite knowing little coming in, still some interesting food for thought. I’m still overall torn on this issue of ceding rights for order—this article sort of rejects this dichotomous framing, but I can understand why a Salvadoran would be suspicious of the efficacy of his suggestions.
