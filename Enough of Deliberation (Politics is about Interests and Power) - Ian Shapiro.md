## Highlights
> Many of the substantive arguments in Democracy and Disagreement resonate favorably with me, but it should be said that this is not a particularly de- manding test.

## Thoughts
- Re [[#^26dbe1]]: This is very funny to me for some reason.
- Re [[#^9e4152]]: Definitely agree with this. I am a bit surprised that he doesn't mention that different groups can have irreconcilably different moral values, making deliberation a non-starter. 
	- Based on the subsequent sentences, it seems Shapiro is going to make the claim that interests and power dominate even these considerations in the political realm (although the ideas that the interests in power espouse are not necessarily self-interested).
## Final Thoughts
# David (12/05/24)

This article is a critical response to [[Democracy and Disagreement - Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson]] by Ian Shapiro.

## Highlights

>  It is one thing to think, as I do, along with them, that much of what divides people politically is susceptible to rational analysis more often than people realize; it is quite another to believe that what prevents better resolution of prevailing disagreements is insufficient deliberation of the Gutmann Thompson sort.

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=42&selection=17,36,21,42|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 42]]

Shapiro agrees that political divides may be more susceptible to rational analysis then we suspect but that deliberation (in the sense of Gutmann and Thompson) is unlikely to resolve these disputes. 

>In my view, Gutmann and Thompson's emphasis on deliberation attends too little to the degree to which moral disagreements in politics are shaped by differences of interest and power.

"Politics is about interests and power"

> The general point here is that the legitimacy of decision-making processes varies with the degree to which they are both inclusive and binding on those who make them. Deliberative processes are not exceptions

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=46&selection=50,0,53,36|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 46]]

The legitimacy of decision-making processes varies with the degree to which they are both inclusive and binding on those who make them. 

> When there is great variation in the impact of a decision, then interests diverge in ways that are relevant to assessing the decision's legitimacy

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=46&selection=57,64,59,51|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 46]]

The impact of a decision effects interests which in turn effects legitimacy. 

> This is most obviously true when there are substantial differences in the capacities of different groups to escape the effects of policies on which they are deciding. Those who can easily avoid them do not have the same kind of interest at stake in a decision as those whose exit costs are prohibitively high. The story of apartheid in American public schools is eloquent testimony of what happens when this fact goes unrecognized. Urban public schools are starved of resources by middle-class voters who opt out either fiscally (to private urban schools) or physically (to suburban schools)

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=47&selection=8,0,15,50|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 47]]

Great example!

>  But they seem not to appreciate that as deliberation operates on the ground in what Douglas Rae has described as the "segmented democracies" that Americans increasingly inhabit, it can be an obstacle to providing these goods.9 When there are great differences in capacity for exit, what is often needed is not widespread deliberation but firm action from above to protect the vulnerable.

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=47&selection=26,8,36,15|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 47]]

Great point!

> Another area in which Gutmann and Thompson's account suffers from lack of due attention to conflicting interests has to do with what shapes the terms of deliberation in modern democracies. There are circumstances in which more deliberation would be a healthy thing in the formation of public policy, but often the principal obstacle is not the lack of will on the part of people with differing moral convictions to deliberate in ways that can minimize their differences. Rather, it results from decisions by powerful players who make it their business to shape the terms of public debate through the financial contributions they make available to politicians and political campaigns. En- gels once described ballots as "paper stones." In the post-Buckley v. Valeo11 world, when any credible political campaign requires multi-million-dollar war chests to buy the requisite television time to do political battle, public delib- eration all too often consists of verbal stones hurled across the airwaves, with victory going to whoever has the most bountiful supply. Granted, this is a long way from what Gutmann and Thompson have in mind when they ad- vocate deliberation, but I find it stunning that a book about the importance of enhancing deliberation in contemporary American politics can ignore the reality it creates

Another great point! 

> along with the Clinton administration's inep- titude in failing to get essential Capitol Hill barons like Senators Moynihan and Nunn on board

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=48&selection=14,31,16,17|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 48]]

What does this mean? Is this similar to the Obama situation with the "public option"?

> Rather, my point is that if we ask the question "What prevented meaningful public dis- cussion of health care reform in 1993 and 1994?," secrecy's significance seems trifling when compared to the way the options were presented in the war of words on television and the activities of political lobbyists. They ensured that important options (notably a Canadian-style single-payer system) were never seriously discussed and that the entire debate came to focus on issues that are irrelevant to the bill's basic goal of achieving universal health care coverage. Arguments about the feasibility of managed competition and the freedom people may or may not have in selecting their own physicians dominated the discussion, as the plight of the 40 million uninsured fell by the wayside.

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=48&selection=33,62,47,74|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 48]]

Another good example!

>  It creates a reality in which, rather than compete in the realm of ideas, politicians actually must compete for campaign contributions. The ideas they advance are those of their financial backers, and those they avoid advancing all too often are ideas that, though they may be in the interests of many in the public, would cause vast sums of money to be given to electoral opponents if they were seriously advanced. How else is one to explain the fact that a single-payer system could not be seriously mooted, even at the start of the public debate, despite a substantial body of academic commentary suggesting that it is easily the most cost-effective way of achieving affordable universal coverage? How else can one explain the fact that neither political party ever proposes massive hikes in the estate tax, although this move would be in the interest of all but a tiny fraction of the electorate?

[[essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement.pdf#page=48&selection=56,36,58,79|essays_on_democracy_and_disagreement, page 48]]

Politicians compete for campaign contributions over ideas.
