## Reading Notes

### Author 

Stephen Kotkin is a historian at the Hoover institute (expertise on Stalin and the Soviet Union). 

### The Five Futures

#### Russia as France
- "A democracy with a rule-of-law system that luxuriates in its absolutist and revolutionary past but no longer threatens its neighbours."

#### Russia Retrenched
- "An authoritarian, resentful, mystical nationalism grounded in anti-Westernism, espousing nominally traditional values, and borrowing incoherently from Slavophilism, Eurasianism, and Eastern Orthodoxy."

#### Russia as a Vassal 
- Junior Partner in an anti-western alliance with China: "A shared commitment to render the world order safe for their respective dictatorships and dominate their regions is driving a de facto vassalage that neither fancies."

#### Russia as North Korea
-  "Russia could become something of a gigantic North Korea: domestically repressive, internationally isolated and transgressive, armed with nuclear weapons, and abjectly dependent on China but still able to buck Beijing."

#### Russia in Chaos
- Failed State!

### Sixth Option?

#### Continental Cul-De-Sac
- This is the option suggested by Putin and his supporters
- "Moscow as a pole in its version of a multipolar world, bossing around Eurasia and operating as a key arbiter of world affairs."

> “We need to find ourselves and understand who we are,” the Kremlin loyalist Sergei Karaganov mused last year. “We are a great Eurasian power, Northern Eurasia, a liberator of peoples, a guarantor of peace, and the military-political core of the World Majority. This is our manifest destiny.”

## Additional Comments

> Russian commentators have taken to retelling the tale of Alexander Nevsky, who in the thirteenth century reigned as prince of Novgorod, one of the states folded into Muscovy, the precursor to imperial Russia. When faced with a two-front challenge, Nevsky chose to ght the crusaders of the west, defeating the Teutons in the Battle of the Ice, and to accommodate the invading Mongols of the east, traveling across central Asia to the capital of the Mongol Golden Horde to be recognized as grand prince of Russia. In this telling, the Western Christians were determined to undermine Russia’s Eastern Christian identity, whereas the Mongols merely wanted Russia to pay tribute. e implication is that today’s accommodation of China does not require Russia to relinquish its identity, whereas a failure to confront the West would.

This is funny. If this is actually a big thing (which I could believe) its quite interesting how much emphasis is placed on the Russian cultural and historical mythos (for example also in Putin's Tucker Carlson interview)

> Being non-Western, however, does not necessarily mean being anti-Western—unless, of course, one is struggling to protect an illiberal regime in a liberal world order. 

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=12&selection=63,9,65,33|five-futures-of-russia, page 12]]

Interesting framing here. I think these regimes wouldn't necessarily disagree that they are illiberal (see Victor Orban), but the West itself is associated with liberalism (and imposing it).

> Later, after Chinese diplomats bragged to all the world and especially to Europe that Xi had extracted a Russian pledge to not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin’s regime announced it was deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. (China went on to criticize the deployments.) It is not likely that any of these episodes were intended as explicit slights. But they made observers wonder about Russia’s evolution toward a North Korean scenario, for even if unintended, they revealed the potential for Moscow to embarrass Beijing without suffering consequences.

The North Korea like dynamic between Russia and China is an interesting point. Even though Russia is the junior party they still have significant leverage.

> Were chaos to engulf Moscow, China could move to retake the expansive lands of the Amur basin that the Romanovs expropriated from the Qing. Japan might forcibly enact its claims to the Northern Territories, which the Russians call the southern Kurils, and Sakhalin Island, both of which Japan once ruled, and possibly part of the Russian Far Eastern mainland, which Japan occupied during the Russian civil war. e Finns might seek to reclaim the chunk of Karelia they once ruled. Such actions could spark a general unraveling or backre by provoking a Russian mass mobilization.

Is this really a plausible scenario? This seems crazy! 

> Belarusians are trapped and unhappy about it

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=18&selection=122,0,134,2|five-futures-of-russia, page 18]]

Is this true? (According to Reddit most regular Belarusian's dislike the government and support Ukraine, and support for Russia is dropping)

Calls to recognise Russia’s “legitimate” interests are frequently heard in critiques of U.S. policy, but the great-power stability purchased by  indulging coercive spheres of influence always proves ephemeral, even as the agonies of sacrificed smaller countries and the ignominy of compromising U.S. values always linger

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=21&selection=14,0,38,38|five-futures-of-russia, page 21]]

Is he trying to argue that Henry Kissinger wasn't hawkish enough? (Trying to balance power)

> The supreme irony of American grand strategy for the past 70 years is that it worked, fostering an integrated world of impressive and shared prosperity, and yet is now being abandoned.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=23&selection=40,1,61,43|five-futures-of-russia, page 23]]

I wish he elaborated more on this! (Is he just talking about economics? What about rollback?)

> To recapture lost ground and to restart the engine of social mobility at home, the United States, which has a mere 1.5 million mathematics teachers and must import knowledge of that subject from East Asia and South Asia, needs to launch a program to produce one million new teachers of math within a decade. It makes little sense to admit students to college if, lacking the universal language of science, engineering, computers, and economics, they are limited to majoring in themselves and their grievances.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=24&selection=43,22,50,32|five-futures-of-russia, page 24]]'

The section (starting with this paragraph) at the end of the article where the author gives prescriptions for American domestic policy seem quite half-baked and out of place.

## Final Thoughts

I think there were a few minor interesting points to think about during the article but overall I would say there was no interesting broad ideas presented.
