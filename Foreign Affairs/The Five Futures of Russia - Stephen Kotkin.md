## Some Notes
> Putin styles himself as a new tsar. But a real tsar would not have to worry about a looming succession crisis and what it might do to his grip on power in the present. Putin does; that is partly why he must simulate elections

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=3&selection=8,0,11,9|five-futures-of-russia, page 3]]

> Stalin, too, had stubbornly clung to power, even as his infirmities worsened. He refused to countenance the emergence of a successor; eventually, he suffered a massive, final stroke and fell into a puddle of his own urine.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=3&selection=94,0,108,51|five-futures-of-russia, page 3]]

The succession of Stalin seems kind of interesting to learn about

> The nineteenth- century Russian satirist Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin remarked of his country that everything changes dramatically every five to ten years but nothing changes in 200 years

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=4&selection=13,1,20,28|five-futures-of-russia, page 4]]

LMAO!

> Leaders such as Putin and China’s Xi Jinping did not capriciously reverse a hopeful process; in no small measure, they resulted from it

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=5&selection=38,36,60,30|five-futures-of-russia, page 5]]
## Future 1: Russia as France

> France is a country with deep-seated bureaucratic and monarchical traditions—and also a fraught revolutionary tradition. Revolutionaries abolished the monarchy only to see it return in the guise of both a king and an emperor and then disappear again, as republics came and went.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=5&selection=66,0,85,68|five-futures-of-russia, page 5]]

The historical/traditional similarities between France and Russia
### French Statism

> the revolutionaries’ efforts to break definitively with the past ended up unwittingly reinforcing statist structures

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=5&selection=111,3,116,60|five-futures-of-russia, page 5]]

France according to Alexis de Tocqueville's *The Old Regime and Revolution*

Monarchical inheritance endures even in the new republic:
* Symbolically through Versailles and the Bourbon dynasty statues
* "inordinately centralized form of rule with immense power and wealth concentrated in Paris"
* "many of its citizens and admirers view as a civilization with a lingering sense of a special mission in the world and in Europe, as well as a language spoken far beyond its border"
### Russian Statism
Like France, but even more extreme:
* Romanovs more powerful than the Bourbons
* Its empire contiguous and much more enduring than the French
* Moscow even more dominant than Paris
* Revolution even more brutal and destructive
### The French Model for Russia
> a democracy with a rule-of-law system that luxuriated in its absolutist and revolutionary past but no longer threatened its neighbors

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=7&selection=9,34,17,9|five-futures-of-russia, page 7]]

France's path to liberal democracy was a torturous path (starting with the French Revolution) and ending with de Gaulle "consolidat\[ing\] a liberal order from above". However, Kotkin rejects the notion that de Gaulle is solely responsible for the modern France but another important piece of the puzzle is that:
> over generations, France developed the impartial, professional institutions—a judiciary, a civil service, a free and open public sphere—of a democratic, republican nation.  ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=7&selection=37,70,41,1|page 7]])

Unfortunately, "Russia was much further from a stable, Western-style constitutional order in 1991 than France had been three decades earlier."
## Future 2: Russia Retrenched

Putinism is not new to Putin:
> What the world now sees as Putinism rst surfaced in the Russian-language periodicals and volunteer societies of the 1970s: an authoritarian, resentful, mystical nationalism grounded in anti-Westernism, espousing nominally traditional values, and borrowing incoherently from Slavophilism, Eurasianism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=7&selection=57,26,93,49|page 7]])

Therefore, these ideas may remain post-Putin. The new ruler however need not support Putin himself and be opposed to the Ukraine war.

Problems facing Russia now:
* Demographic decline: 90M working-age pop in 2006 has fallen to 80M and still on the decline
* Low robotization rates
* Low education spending
* Putin's war has handicapped the economic future by inducing young tech workers to flee
* "long-term development depends on technology transfers from advanced countries"
	* Inhibited by the Ukraine war and embrace of Hamas

These problems may cause the nationalists and elites of Russia to grow to oppose Putin's personalist regime:
> neither did \[Prigozhin's march\] galvanize the regime’s supporters to defend Putin in real time ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=9&selection=61,6,62,48|page 9]])

Retrenchment would likely be
> spurred by a recognition that Russia lacks the means to oppose the West without end, pays an exorbitant price for trying, and risks permanently losing vital European ties in exchange for a humiliating dependence on China ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=9&selection=71,30,74,31|page 9]])
## Future 3: Russia as Vassal

Chinese economic booms helped foster (through increased global demand) Russia's middle class and economic boom. But societal and cultural relations between the two countries remain shallow: "Russians are apprehensive of China’s power, and many Chinese who hold weakness in contempt ridicule Russia online." Currently, these issues have been avoided by the authoritarians in charge:
> \[Putin and Xi\] have fallen into a bromance, meeting an astonishing 42 times while in power, publicly lauding each other as “my best friend” (Xi on Putin) and “dear friend” (Putin on Xi). ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=11&selection=24,0,27,1|page 11]])

The Chinese have become the senior partner in this relationship and avoiding becoming dependent on Russia when possible.

Russia is always skeptical of Western influence but have minimal reservations about influence from the East:
> today’s accommodation of China does not require Russia to relinquish its identity, whereas a failure to confront the West would.  ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=12&selection=56,1,57,55|page 12]])
## Future 4: Russia as North Korea

There is a sense of interdependence in the relationship between China and North Korea, despite North Korea being so much weaker:
> During Beijing’s intervention to rescue Pyongyang in the Korean War, Mao, employing a proverb, stated that if the lips (North Korea) are gone, the teeth (China) will be cold. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=13&selection=40,44,42,72|page 13]])

This can be wielded by the North Koreans to flout China:
> As ruling circles in Beijing have discovered time and again, Kim does not always defer to his patrons. In 2017, he had his half brother, Kim Jong Nam, who was under China’s protection abroad, murdered. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=13&selection=97,0,98,27|page 13]])

Russia, despite its many difference, may find themselves in a similar situation:
>  Russia could become something of a gigantic North Korea: domestically repressive, internationally isolated and transgressive, armed with nuclear weapons, and abjectly dependent on China but still able to buck Beijing. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=15&selection=15,8,18,37|page 15]])

The risk for China if Russia were to "fall" to the west:
> At a minimum, access to Russian oil and gas, China’s partial hedge against a sea blockade, would be at risk. But even if China were gaining little materially from Russia, preventing Russia from turning to the West would remain a topmost national security priority. An American-leaning Russia would enable enhanced Western surveillance of China.... Worse, China would suddenly need to redeploy substantial assets from elsewhere to defend its expansive northern border. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=16&selection=12,27,20,74|page 16]])
## Future 5: Russia in Chaos

Despite the apparent stability of Putin's regime, "Russian states overseen from St. Petersburg and Moscow, respectively, both disintegrated in the past 100-odd years, both times unexpectedly yet completely."

Dissolution of the Russian Federation is unlikely, unlike the USSR, even under chaos:
> Even amid anarchy, however, Russia would not dissolve like the Soviet Union. As the KGB’s final chief analyst lamented, the Soviet federation resembled a chocolate bar: its collective pieces (the 15 union republics) were demarcated as if with creases and thus were ready to be broken off. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=16&selection=51,0,52,6|page 16]])

However, small chunks here and there may be at risk to neighbours.

Criminal syndicates and cybercriminals may become more powerful.
## Continental Cul-de-Sac

This idea is the one prevalent among pro-Putin figures as well as as critics:
> Moscow as a pole in its version of a multipolar world, bossing around Eurasia and operating as a key arbiter of world affairs. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=17&selection=138,59,139,74|page 17]])

Already a failure since the recession of territories after the fall of the Soviet Union.

> Russia’s inuence in its immediate neighborhood has been diminishing, too. e bulk of non-Russians in the former Soviet borderlands want less and less to do with their former overlord and certainly do not want to be reabsorbed by it. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=18&selection=113,0,121,17|page 18]])

No basis for being a pole in the world order:
* Uninspiring economic model
* Can't afford to send aid
* Pariah along with North Korea and Iran
* "Even many former Soviet partners that refused to condemn Russia over Ukraine, including India and South Africa, do not view Moscow as a developmental partner but as scaolding for boosting their own sovereignty."
## What should the West do?

Russians are hoping for a war between the West and China, in which its relative position will grow. This must be avoided by the West while staying strong among each other.

Realist strategies of spheres-of-influence did not work:
> Consider that in the aftermath of Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s maneuvering, China and Russia are closer than ever. Arms control is eectively dead. Détente died before many people even knew what the word connoted, but the damage in Indochina, Latin America, South Asia, and elsewhere remains palpable even now. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=21&selection=38,38,45,9|page 21]

Kotkin appears okay with NATO expansion:
> Critics of NATO expansion, for their part, blame it for Russia’s revanchism, as if a repressive authoritarian regime that invades its neighbors in the name of its security is something unexpected in Russian history and wouldn’t have happened anyway had the alliance not expanded—leaving even more countries vulnerable. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=21&selection=103,24,107,52|page 21]])

The US must maintain pressure on Russia but incentivize retrenchment.

The US should become pro-Russian while not pro-Putin: 
> Western policymakers and civil society organizations should welcome and reward —with visas, job opportunities, investment opportunities, cultural exchanges—those Russians who want to deconate Putin and Russia but not necessarily embrace Jeersonian ideals. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=22&selection=111,65,131,16|page 22]])

Kotkin is a supporter of the old American model of free and open trade and dislikes the current turn to protectionism:
> The supreme irony of American grand strategy for the past 70 years is that it worked, fostering an integrated world of impressive and shared prosperity, and yet is now being abandoned. e United States was open for business to its adversaries, without reciprocation. Today, however, so- called industrial policy and protectionism are partially closing the country not just to rivals but also to U.S. allies, partners, friends, and potential friends. American policy has come to resemble China’s—right when the latter has hit a wall. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=23&selection=40,1,69,22|page 23]])

> A strategic trade policy—reected by initiatives such as the Trans-Pacic Partnership trade agreement, which Washington crafted but then abandoned—might be a nonstarter in the current domestic political climate. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=23&selection=84,0,99,35|page 23]])

I remember the TPP failing at the time, maybe this was kind of the turning point in American economic policy (of course amplified by Trump afterward).

Kotkin also calls for more STEM education (and vocational schools):
> To recapture lost ground and to restart the engine of social mobility at home, the United States, which has a mere 1.5 million mathematics teachers and must import knowledge of that subject from East Asia and South Asia, needs to launch a program to produce one million new teachers of math within a decade. It makes little sense to admit students to college if, lacking the universal language of science, engineering, computers, and economics, they are limited to majoring in themselves and their grievances. ([[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=24&selection=43,22,50,32|page 24]])

Also reduce (environmental) regulations to build more houses and revitalize civic consciousness.
## Final Thoughts

The cul-de-sac and France futures appear (in Kotkin's own portrayal) as non-starters, at least in any short-term post-Putin scenario. The main question seems to be how entrenched in China's sphere will Russia become long-term. However, it seems like the France future is the aspirational goal for Kotkin and the role the West ought to play in this is incentivize retrenchment on the part of Russia (and thereby minimize the influence of China?) while being an ideal civilization that Russia would want to join. These prescriptions for the West are minimally invasive and I believe wants to leave the fate of the Russians to themselves (with only a bit of nudging from the West).

## Reading Notes

### Author 

Stephen Kotkin is a historian at the Hoover institute (expertise on Stalin and the Soviet Union). 

### The Five Futures

#### Russia as France
- "A democracy with a rule-of-law system that luxuriates in its absolutist and revolutionary past but no longer threatens its neighbours."

#### Russia Retrenched
- "An authoritarian, resentful, mystical nationalism grounded in anti-Westernism, espousing nominally traditional values, and borrowing incoherently from Slavophilism, Eurasianism, and Eastern Orthodoxy."

#### Russia as a Vassal 
- Junior Partner in an anti-western alliance with China: "A shared commitment to render the world order safe for their respective dictatorships and dominate their regions is driving a de facto vassalage that neither fancies."

#### Russia as North Korea
-  "Russia could become something of a gigantic North Korea: domestically repressive, internationally isolated and transgressive, armed with nuclear weapons, and abjectly dependent on China but still able to buck Beijing."

#### Russia in Chaos
- Failed State!

### Sixth Option?

#### Continental Cul-De-Sac
- This is the option suggested by Putin and his supporters
- "Moscow as a pole in its version of a multipolar world, bossing around Eurasia and operating as a key arbiter of world affairs."

> “We need to find ourselves and understand who we are,” the Kremlin loyalist Sergei Karaganov mused last year. “We are a great Eurasian power, Northern Eurasia, a liberator of peoples, a guarantor of peace, and the military-political core of the World Majority. This is our manifest destiny.”

## Additional Comments

> Russian commentators have taken to retelling the tale of Alexander Nevsky, who in the thirteenth century reigned as prince of Novgorod, one of the states folded into Muscovy, the precursor to imperial Russia. When faced with a two-front challenge, Nevsky chose to ght the crusaders of the west, defeating the Teutons in the Battle of the Ice, and to accommodate the invading Mongols of the east, traveling across central Asia to the capital of the Mongol Golden Horde to be recognized as grand prince of Russia. In this telling, the Western Christians were determined to undermine Russia’s Eastern Christian identity, whereas the Mongols merely wanted Russia to pay tribute. e implication is that today’s accommodation of China does not require Russia to relinquish its identity, whereas a failure to confront the West would.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=12&selection=35,0,57,55|five-futures-of-russia, page 12]]

This is funny. If this is actually a big thing (which I could believe) its quite interesting how much emphasis is placed on the Russian cultural and historical mythos (for example also in Putin's Tucker Carlson interview)

> Being non-Western, however, does not necessarily mean being anti-Western—unless, of course, one is struggling to protect an illiberal regime in a liberal world order. 

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=12&selection=63,9,65,33|five-futures-of-russia, page 12]]

Interesting framing here. I think these regimes wouldn't necessarily disagree that they are illiberal (see Victor Orban), but the West itself is associated with liberalism (and imposing it).

> Later, after Chinese diplomats bragged to all the world and especially to Europe that Xi had extracted a Russian pledge to not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Putin’s regime announced it was deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. (China went on to criticize the deployments.) It is not likely that any of these episodes were intended as explicit slights. But they made observers wonder about Russia’s evolution toward a North Korean scenario, for even if unintended, they revealed the potential for Moscow to embarrass Beijing without suffering consequences.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=15&selection=45,5,73,19|five-futures-of-russia, page 15]]

The North Korea like dynamic between Russia and China is an interesting point. Even though Russia is the junior party they still have significant leverage.

> Were chaos to engulf Moscow, China could move to retake the expansive lands of the Amur basin that the Romanovs expropriated from the Qing. Japan might forcibly enact its claims to the Northern Territories, which the Russians call the southern Kurils, and Sakhalin Island, both of which Japan once ruled, and possibly part of the Russian Far Eastern mainland, which Japan occupied during the Russian civil war. e Finns might seek to reclaim the chunk of Karelia they once ruled. Such actions could spark a general unraveling or backre by provoking a Russian mass mobilization.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=17&selection=36,0,88,26|five-futures-of-russia, page 17]]

Is this really a plausible scenario? This seems crazy! 

> Belarusians are trapped and unhappy about it

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=18&selection=122,0,134,2|five-futures-of-russia, page 18]]

Is this true? (According to Reddit most regular Belarusian's dislike the government and support Ukraine, and support for Russia is dropping)

Calls to recognise Russia’s “legitimate” interests are frequently heard in critiques of U.S. policy, but the great-power stability purchased by  indulging coercive spheres of influence always proves ephemeral, even as the agonies of sacrificed smaller countries and the ignominy of compromising U.S. values always linger

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=21&selection=14,0,38,38|five-futures-of-russia, page 21]]

Is he trying to argue that Henry Kissinger wasn't hawkish enough? (Trying to balance power)

> The supreme irony of American grand strategy for the past 70 years is that it worked, fostering an integrated world of impressive and shared prosperity, and yet is now being abandoned.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=23&selection=40,1,61,43|five-futures-of-russia, page 23]]

I wish he elaborated more on this! (Is he just talking about economics? What about rollback?)

> To recapture lost ground and to restart the engine of social mobility at home, the United States, which has a mere 1.5 million mathematics teachers and must import knowledge of that subject from East Asia and South Asia, needs to launch a program to produce one million new teachers of math within a decade. It makes little sense to admit students to college if, lacking the universal language of science, engineering, computers, and economics, they are limited to majoring in themselves and their grievances.

[[five-futures-of-russia.pdf#page=24&selection=43,22,50,32|five-futures-of-russia, page 24]]'

The section (starting with this paragraph) at the end of the article where the author gives prescriptions for American domestic policy seem quite half-baked and out of place.

## Final Thoughts

I think there were a few minor interesting points to think about during the article but overall I would say there was no interesting broad ideas presented.
