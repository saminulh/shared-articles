IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This article was written in April 1971

## Reading Notes

> The idealism of much of non-college youth at that time was in fact reflected in a show of highly patriotic feeling, support for the war and even in a disproportionate backing for George Wallace's 1968 presi- dential candidacy. Furthermore, opinion polls dealing with the relationship of age to views on the Vietnam war have consistently shown that persons over 50 have been more numerous and more consistent in their opposition to the war than have all other groups. As a 1970 report from the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan put it, "this 'generation gap' that one would have expected, wherein the young oppose the war and the old support it, simply failed to appear."

Interesting fact!

> However, a "gap" does exist. But it is between persons on and off campus rather than between the younger and the older. Faculty members, for ex- ample, who are as a rule much more opposed than students to militant activ- ism and campus politicization, are as a group fairly close to their students on substantive issues such as Vietnam, civil rights and domestic social policy. Both tend to espouse as their dominant political ideology what might be described as Kennedy-McCarthy liberalism and the program of the left- liberal antiwar wing of the Democratic Party. The non-college population, on the other hand, has over the last five years gradually moved in a conservative direction, until by 1970, 52 percent described themselves as conservative, as against 34 percent who thought of themselves as liberals.

Essentially a summary of the article

## Overall Thoughts

Some interesting facts but not a lot of analysis. Mostly a data dump. 
Would however be interesting to see similar polls and statistics today.
