## Reading Notes

> There are alternatives to the Bukele model for reducing crime. In cities in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, politicians have managed to decrease homicides without eroding civil and human rights by making sustained investments in democratic policing, which emphasizes transparency, accountability, and civil liberties. These measures may not work as quickly, and they may not be as conspicuous.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=3&selection=107,0,127,35|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 3]]

I wonder how effective these other measures are relatively, even in the long time-horizon.

>  Officials in countries including Mexico and Brazil have shelled out millions in consultancy fees for the advice of former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on crime-fighting techniques, with few discernible long-term results

LOL!

> Addressing impunity requires more, rather than less, transparency and accountability

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=8&selection=6,25,7,37|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 8]]

I understand the principle of this and the cautionary tale he is presenting, but how do you square the expediency that is seemingly necessary in handling these gangs with the bureaucratic overhead that transparency and accountability typically brings?

> Officials must invest more in civilian policing agencies to incentivize good and effective police behavior…

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=8&selection=56,47,62,7|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 8]]

This suggestion requires more capital diverted to police institutions. Makes sense, but could be infeasible for a state overtaken by gang violence. If the current government can be trusted, maybe the claim is that they can “restore order” and then the more functional and productive society can more easily sustain an effective police force (and also reduce the relative value of gang membership, thereby making gangs less powerful). I’m curious how the US solved corrupt policing issues from the Prohibition Era.

> the city made a sustained effort to expand its \[Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl’s\] local police force and strengthen trust in local law enforcement

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=9&selection=41,6,45,10|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 9]]

How do you go about strengthening trust?

> Despite their effectiveness at the local level, such alternative policing methods have not gained national traction because they are eclipsed by flashy and politically expedient iron-fist approaches

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=9&selection=102,0,110,13|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 9]]

I’d also imagine these methods don’t scale as well to the national level — you can spread that (tax) burden of fixing a single city onto the entire national population, but of course this won’t be the case if it’s a national problem.

>  Given the popularity of the visible deployment of the armed forces from one emergency to the next, resources are channeled toward military budgets rather than to less sexy but crucial reforms to civilian police and the judiciary

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=9&selection=110,14,113,61|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 9]]

Seeing how using the army is so obviously the easy answer (literally a bunch of people with guns and nothing else to do), it makes me wonder what these countries even have a military for at this point lol. Is it insane to try and demilitarize your country (perhaps move to make the army a civilian force)? In the region, Costa Rica and Panama apparently doesn’t have a standing army, maybe that’s playable for others?

## Thoughts

Didn’t really learn much new things about the El Salvador situation, despite knowing little coming in, still some interesting food for thought. I’m still overall torn on this issue of ceding rights for order—this article sort of rejects this dichotomous framing, but I can understand why a Salvadoran would be suspicious of the efficacy of his suggestions.

## Reading Notes

### Origin of the Gangs

> El Salvador owes much of its dramatic drop in crime to Bukele’s crackdown on street gangs and criminal organizations, including MS-13 and Barrio 18.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=2&selection=60,0,62,14|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 2]]

Its kinda wild that both these gangs started in Los Angeles. I wonder if the gang/crime problem could be traced as a direct consequence of the rise of these gangs in LA or would the country still have just as bad a gang/crime problem today if it weren't for these American born gangs, just of a different nature (perhaps this could be answered by comparing with other countries in South and Central America)

> In El Salvador, for example, anybody born after 1979 has only known life under either a brutal civil war, which lasted from 1979 to 1992, or the subsequent internecine gang warfare that has killed tens of thousands and driven many more to ee the country

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=6&selection=161,1,194,14|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 6]]

This suggests that perhaps these gangs just happened to be in a position to fill the power vacuum left after the civil war and had it not been for them it may have just been other gangs instead. The following quote from Wikipedia is further evidence: 

>Many MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the end of the [Salvadoran Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War "Salvadoran Civil War") in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to [Central America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America "Central America").

### The Conflict between Democracy and Security

>There are alternatives to the Bukele model for reducing crime. In cities in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, politicians have managed to decrease homicides without eroding civil and human rights by making sustained investments in democratic policing, which emphasizes transparency, accountability, and civil liberties. ese measures may not work as quickly, and they may not be as conspicuous. But they do not sacrice democracy on the altar of public safety. 

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=3&selection=106,1,130,31|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 3]]

I don't know too much about the situations in each of these countries, but from what I do know it does not appear like any of these attempts have been that effective long term.

> They also fail to solve the underlying problems, such as corruption and impunity, that generate such violence and instability in the first place.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=3&selection=98,1,104,10|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 3]]

> Militarized states of emergency are no silver bullet: for any public safety measures to permanently succeed, they must not come at the expense of the democratic institutions that protect civilians from abuse at the hands of the government.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=4&selection=6,0,8,52|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 4]]

I wonder what Przeworksi (or the work of Przeworksi) would say about the above. I could see a few possibilities. One would be that actually this stuff doesn't matter much at all (since without the required material conditions people aren't sufficiently incentivized to preserve democratic institutions). Another take would be that once the material conditions are met perhaps stuff like this plays a role in transitioning to a successful democracy. With this view I could see either attacking or defending Bukele's approach. On the one hand you could argue that this will set a precedent which undermines the integrity of democratic institutions, on the other hand you could argue that perhaps this is necessary to pull society into the state where the "dynamics and equilibriums of democracy" take over as described by Przeworski. 

>  Moreover, the normalization of states of emergency and the militarization of public life erodes citizens’ ability to influence policy, and it weakens trust in the capacity of civilian institutions to solve the country’s problems.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=6&selection=66,46,71,45|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 6]]

To make this argument I think he should have given more specific examples of how (if) this has effected areas of politics outside of crime. 

> Bukele came to power pledging to bring an end to this state of chaos, and he has proceeded to do so by a popular demand that has not diminished even amid his dismantling of democracy from within.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=6&selection=194,16,197,22|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 6]]

I could believe this, but he hasn't made a strong case for it. 

> Even in countries without states of emergency, the militarization of law enforcement can have damaging antidemocratic consequences. In Mexico, for instance, the country has grown steadily more illiberal since President Felipe Calderón deployed the military in 2006 as part of an ill-fated eort to combat drug trackers, despite a constitutional prohibition on doing so. Human rights violations have gone up in the intervening years, as has violent crime. But subsequent administrations have refused to change course, choosing instead to double down on the militarization of public safety. Amid persistently high rates of cartel violence, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as AMLO, has granted the armed forces even more expansive powers, including oversight over the country’s air and sea ports. As a result, citizens are increasingly subject to the whims of the military rather than to the rule of law.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=7&selection=25,0,41,40|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 7]]

Here he starts giving some actual examples but even then doesn't really make a clear link between the militarization of public safety to its effect on democratic institutions. 

> Corruption and impunity are the key obstacles to public safety across the region, where gangsters elude prison or run criminal enterprises from behind bars because police, judges, and prison wardens are complicit in organized crime.

[[the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04.pdf#page=7&selection=50,11,62,0|the-costs-of-el-salvadors-crime-crackdown-2024-03-20-09-04, page 7]]

Its not clear to me that Bukele's approach can't reduce this. 
## Thoughts

This article argues that despite the success of Nayib Bukele's heavy handed approach in reducing crime in El Salvador we should be wary of it due to its potential to erode democratic institutions. Unfortunately I don't feel like this article does a good job of arguing how it erodes democratic institutions, either in theory or in practice. I do think the general discussion of rights/democracy v.s public safety and their tradeoff is interesting. As mentioned above I am curious how the work of Przeworksi plays into it. I also find it interesting how many liberal scholars seem to implicitly assume that rights and democracy are one and the same ([[Liberalism and Conservatism - Patrick Deneen#Week 1 - Liberalism Sources and Themes|this is water]]) ^1ebc4b
