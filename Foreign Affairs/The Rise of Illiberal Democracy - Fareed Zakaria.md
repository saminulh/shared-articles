## Notes

> Today the two strands of liberal democracy, interwoven in the Western political fabric, are coming apart in the rest of the world. Democracy is flourishing; constitutional liberalism is not.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=3&selection=4,39,7,33|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 3]]
* The central conundrum

> And to date few illiberal democracies have matured into liberal democracies; if any- thing, they are moving toward heightened illiberalism

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=4&selection=8,1,11,53|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 4]]

>  But to go beyond this minimalist definition and label a country democratic only if it guarantees a comprehensive catalog of social, political, economic, and religious rights turns the word democracy into a badge of honor rather than a descriptive category.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=5&selection=39,13,44,23|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 5]]
* Similar sentiment raised in [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski]]

> In almost all of its variants, constitutional liberalism argues that human beings have certain natural (or “inalienable”) rights and that governments must accept a basic law, limiting its own powers, that secures them.

>  in 1638 the town of Hartford adopted the first written constitution \[called the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut\] in modern history.

* Wild!

>  Until the twentieth century, most countries in Western Europe were liberal autocracies or, at best, semi-democracies

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=6&selection=44,20,44,67|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 6]]

>  For much of modern history, what characterized governments in Europe and North America, and diªerentiated them from those around the world, was not democracy but consti- tutional liberalism.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=7&selection=20,13,23,20|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 7]]
- Very interesting point. You can probably make a compelling argument that constitutional liberalism (or at least private property rights and rule of law) is the more important factor for modernization and development than democracy.

> Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia are examples of liberalizing autocracies, while South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand are liberal semi-democracies. Both groups, however, are more liberal than they are democratic, which is also true of the region’s only liberal democracy, Japan; Papua New Guinea, and to a lesser extent the Philippines, are the only examples of illiberal democracy in East Asia

* Is Taiwan still just a semi-democracy?

> Constitutional liberalism has led to democracy, but democracy does not seem to bring constitutional liberalism

* Interesting to consider how Bukele’s story will go. He seems to be in a state of illiberal autocracy/semi-democracy at the moment, maybe this can transition to liberal autocracy with enough institutional development.

> Many of the countries of Central Europe, on the other hand, have moved successfully from communism to liberal democracy, having gone through the same phase of liberalization without democracy as other European countries did during the nineteenth century.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=8&selection=38,0,39,60|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 8]]
- Very interesting to consider this in contrast to the point in [[The Five Futures of Russia - Stephen Kotkin#Future 1 Russia as France]] that Russia doesn’t have the institutional/cultural background and history to support democracy/liberalism.
- Also interesting to consider that this tradition is able to outlast a century of communist rule, is the reason that
	1. these cultural ideas are rather durable (and maybe the communist regime was pretty unpopular throughout),
	2. there was a sort of revival of these ideas during the death knells of communism, or
	3. these ideas are somewhat compatible with communism (communism after all being an idea of the liberal tradition)?

> Britain’s legacy of law and administration has proved more beneficial than France’s policy of enfranchising some of its colonial populations.

> As if confirming Mill’s fears, consider the words of Alexandr Lukashenko after being elected president of Belarus with an overwhelming majority in a free election in 1994, when asked about limiting his powers: “There will be no dictatorship. I am of the people, and I am going to be for the people.”

> Over the last decade, elected governments claiming to represent the people have steadily encroached on the powers and rights of other elements in society, a usurpation that is both horizontal (from other branches of the national government) and vertical (from regional and local authorities as well as private businesses and other nongovernmental groups).

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=10&selection=33,61,39,8|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 10]]

Presidential systems:
- Tend to produce strong leaders even with just a plurality (which would require a coalition in a parliamentary system)
- Presidents fill cabinets with cronies rather than party members, thus reducing accountability
- Presidents can bypass the legislature more easily
Interesting to contrast with claims of Canada’s PM being the most powerful leader among Western nations.

> Countries like France and Prussia, on the other hand, where the monarchy had eªec- tively centralized power (both horizontally and vertically), often ended up illiberal and undemocratic.

## Final Thoughts
A banger article. Makes a compelling argument that liberalism, not democracy, is the more important ingredient for a nation’s development. The strongest arguments (IMO) come from the negative argument to democracy when the conditions aren’t right (even something you would predict from Madison’s arguments). One question I have is if there is a meaningful distinction in this between economic vs. social liberalization. For example, Singapore is prospering while liberalizing more on the economic angle and not so much on the social. Presumably in places where there’s more ethnic tensions (e.g., Yugoslavia), the liberalization has to occur socially—this seems way, way harder (there are a lot of cultural elements that are hard to control, and also economic liberalization comes with wealth which makes things generally easier).

I will also want to look into how this compares to Shapiro’s general pessimism with the courts, although that is not inherently a conflicting idea with Zakaria’s positions on constitutional liberalism.

## Reading Notes

> 50 percent do better on political liberties than on civil ones. In other words, half of the “democratising” countries in the world today are illiberal democracies

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=3&selection=71,11,71,68|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 3]]

This seems like a weird way to characterise illiberal democracy (perhaps its just summarised weird). 

> Democracy is one public virtue, not the only one, and the relation of democracy to other public virtues and vices can only be understood if democracy is clearly distinguished from the other characteristics of political systems.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=5&selection=13,0,23,18|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 5]]

I think this is a good point which gives an argument for the procedural definition of democracy. 

> Constitutional liberalism, on the other hand, is not about the procedures for selecting government, but rather government’s goals. It refers to the tradition, deep in Western history, that seeks to protect an individual’s autonomy and dignity against coercion, whatever the source— state, church, or society.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=5&selection=50,0,51,72|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 5]]

Definition of Constitutional Liberalism

> As in the West, liberalization in East Asia has included economic liber- alization, which is crucial in promoting both growth and liberal democracy. Historically, the factors most closely associated with full- fledged liberal democracies are capitalism, a bourgeoisie, and a high per capita gnp. Today’s East Asian governments are a mix of democracy, liberalism, capitalism, oligarchy, and corruption—much like Western governments circa 1900.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=7&selection=36,68,40,68|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 7]]

According to the author capitalism and "economic freedom" are integral to liberal democracy. 

> He pointed out that, as of 1983, “every single country in the Third World that emerged from colonial rule since the Second World War with a population of at least one million (and almost all the smaller colonies as well) with a continuous democratic experience is a former British colony.”fl British rule meant not democracy— colonialism is by definition undemocratic—but constitutional liberalism. Britain’s legacy of law and administration has proved more beneficial than France’s policy of enfranchising some of its colonial populations.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=9&selection=5,64,17,21|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 9]]

This is a very interesting fact and claim. 

 Constitutional government is in fact the key to a successful economic reform policy. The experience of East Asia and Central Europe suggests that when regimes—whether authoritarian, as in East Asia, or liberal democratic, as in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic—protect individual rights, including those of property and contract, and create a framework of law and administration, capitalism and growth will follow.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=14&selection=0,0,4,4|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 14]]

Are China and Vietnam now counterexamples to this? (Or would he argue that Deng sufficiently increased individual rights?)

> In a recent speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, explaining what it takes for capitalism to flourish, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan concluded that, “The guiding mechanism of a free market economy. . . is a bill of rights, enforced by an impartial judiciary”

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=14&selection=4,6,9,33|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 14]]

This may be true to some extent, but its important to consider democratic constraints on capitalism's negative effects (extra irony here given the statement by Alan Greenspan)

> He may well be a liberal democrat at heart, but Yeltsin’s actions have created a Russian super-presidency. We can only hope his successor will not abuse it.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=14&selection=29,63,32,9|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 14]]

Uh oh! 

> Surveying the breakdown of African and Asian democracies in the 1960s, two scholars concluded that democracy “is simply not viable in an environment of intense ethnic preferences.” Re- cent studies, particularly of Africa and Central Asia, have confirmed this pessimism

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=16&selection=1,19,5,14|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 16]]

Empirical evidence suggests that democracy is not viable in an environment of intense ethnic preference. 

> When divining the cause behind this correlation, one thing becomes > clear: the democratic peace is actually the liberal peace. Writing in the eighteenth century, Kant believed that democracies were tyrannical, and he specifically excluded them from his conception of “republican” governments, which lived in a zone of peace. Republicanism, for Kant, meant a separation of powers, checks and balances, the rule of law, protection of individual rights, and some level of representation in government (though nothing close to universal suffrage). Kant’s other explanations for the “perpetual peace” between republics are all closely linked to their constitutional and liberal character: a mutual respect for the rights of each other’s citizens, a system of checks and balances assuring that no single leader can drag his country into war, and classical liberal economic policies—most importantly, free trade—which create an interdependence that makes war costly and cooperation useful.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=16&selection=32,0,32,66|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 16]]

> Michael Doyle, the leading scholar on the subject, confirms in his 1997 book Ways of War and Peace that without constitutional liberalism, democracy itself has no peace-inducing qualities:

> Kant distrusted unfettered, democratic majoritarianism, and his argument offers no support for a claim that all participatory polities— democracies—should be peaceful, either in general or between fellow democracies. Many participatory polities have been non-liberal. For two thousand years before the modern age, popular rule was widely associated with aggressiveness (by Thucydides) or imperial success (by Machiavelli) . . . The decisive preference of the median voter might well include “ethnic cleansing” against other democratic polities.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=17&selection=13,0,19,49|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 17]]

> The distinction between liberal and illiberal democracies sheds light on another striking statistical correlation. Political scientists Jack Snyder and Edward Mansfield contend, using an impressive data set, that over the last 200 years democratizing states went to war significantly more often than either stable autocracies or liberal democracies. In countries not grounded in constitutional liberalism, the rise of democracy often brings with it hyper-nationalism and war-mongering. When the political system is opened up, diverse groups with incompatible interests gain access to power and press their demands. Political and military leaders, who are often embattled remnants of the old authoritarian order, realize that to succeed that they must rally the masses behind a national cause. The result is invariably aggressive rhetoric and policies, which often drag countries into confrontation and war. Noteworthy examples range from Napoleon III’s France, Wilhelmine Germany, and Taisho Japan to those in today’s newspapers, like Armenia and Azerbaijan and Milosevic’s Serbia. The democratic peace, it turns out, has little to do with democracy.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=18&selection=4,0,23,73|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 18]]

An argument that constitutional liberalism is actually responsible for the peace between democracies rather than democracy itself. 
## Overall Thoughts

The underlying idea of the article seems to be that constitutional liberalism is actually the source of much of the positive effects that are typically attributed to democracy in the western world.
