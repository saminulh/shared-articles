IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This article was written in 1997
## Reading Notes

> 50 percent do better on political liberties than on civil ones. In other words, half of the “democratising” countries in the world today are illiberal democracies

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=3&selection=71,11,71,68|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 3]]

This seems like a weird way to characterise illiberal democracy (perhaps its just summarised weird). 

> Democracy is one public virtue, not the only one, and the relation of democracy to other public virtues and vices can only be understood if democracy is clearly distinguished from the other characteristics of political systems.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=5&selection=13,0,23,18|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 5]]

I think this is a good point which gives an argument for the procedural definition of democracy. 

> Constitutional liberalism, on the other hand, is not about the procedures for selecting government, but rather government’s goals. It refers to the tradition, deep in Western history, that seeks to protect an individual’s autonomy and dignity against coercion, whatever the source— state, church, or society.

Definition of Constitutional Liberalism

> As in the West, liberalization in East Asia has included economic liber- alization, which is crucial in promoting both growth and liberal democracy. Historically, the factors most closely associated with full- fledged liberal democracies are capitalism, a bourgeoisie, and a high per capita gnp. Today’s East Asian governments are a mix of democracy, liberalism, capitalism, oligarchy, and corruption—much like Western governments circa 1900.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=7&selection=36,68,40,68|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 7]]

According to the author capitalism and "economic freedom" are integral to liberal democracy. 

> He pointed out that, as of 1983, “every single country in the Third World that emerged from colonial rule since the Second World War with a population of at least one million (and almost all the smaller colonies as well) with a continuous democratic experience is a former British colony.”fl British rule meant not democracy— colonialism is by definition undemocratic—but constitutional liberalism. Britain’s legacy of law and administration has proved more beneficial than France’s policy of enfranchising some of its colonial populations.

This is a very interesting fact and claim. 

 Constitutional government is in fact the key to a successful economic reform policy. The experience of East Asia and Central Europe suggests that when regimes—whether authoritarian, as in East Asia, or liberal democratic, as in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic—protect individual rights, including those of property and contract, and create a framework of law and administration, capitalism and growth will follow.

Are China and Vietnam now counterexamples to this? (Or would he argue that Deng sufficiently increased individual rights?)

> In a recent speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, explaining what it takes for capitalism to flourish, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan concluded that, “The guiding mechanism of a free market economy. . . is a bill of rights, enforced by an impartial judiciary”

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=14&selection=4,6,9,33|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 14]]

This may be true to some extent, but its important to consider democratic constraints on capitalism's negative effects (extra irony here given the statement by Alan Greenspan)

> He may well be a liberal democrat at heart, but Yeltsin’s actions have created a Russian super-presidency. We can only hope his successor will not abuse it.

Uh oh! 

> Surveying the breakdown of African and Asian democracies in the 1960s, two scholars concluded that democracy “is simply not viable in an environment of intense ethnic preferences.” Re- cent studies, particularly of Africa and Central Asia, have confirmed this pessimism

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=16&selection=1,19,5,14|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 16]]

Empirical evidence suggests that democracy is not viable in an environment of intense ethnic preference. 

> When divining the cause behind this correlation, one thing becomes > clear: the democratic peace is actually the liberal peace. Writing in the eighteenth century, Kant believed that democracies were tyrannical, and he specifically excluded them from his conception of “republican” governments, which lived in a zone of peace. Republicanism, for Kant, meant a separation of powers, checks and balances, the rule of law, protection of individual rights, and some level of representation in government (though nothing close to universal suffrage). Kant’s other explanations for the “perpetual peace” between republics are all closely linked to their constitutional and liberal character: a mutual respect for the rights of each other’s citizens, a system of checks and balances assuring that no single leader can drag his country into war, and classical liberal economic policies—most importantly, free trade—which create an interdependence that makes war costly and cooperation useful.

> Michael Doyle, the leading scholar on the subject, confirms in his 1997 book Ways of War and Peace that without constitutional liberalism, democracy itself has no peace-inducing qualities:

> Kant distrusted unfettered, democratic majoritarianism, and his argument offers no support for a claim that all participatory polities— democracies—should be peaceful, either in general or between fellow democracies. Many participatory polities have been non-liberal. For two thousand years before the modern age, popular rule was widely associated with aggressiveness (by Thucydides) or imperial success (by Machiavelli) . . . The decisive preference of the median voter might well include “ethnic cleansing” against other democratic polities.

[[the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy.pdf#page=17&selection=13,0,19,49|the_rise_of_illiberal_democracy, page 17]]

> The distinction between liberal and illiberal democracies sheds light on another striking statistical correlation. Political scientists Jack Snyder and Edward Mansfield contend, using an impressive data set, that over the last 200 years democratizing states went to war significantly more often than either stable autocracies or liberal democracies. In countries not grounded in constitutional liberalism, the rise of democracy often brings with it hyper-nationalism and war-mongering. When the politi- cal system is opened up, diverse groups with incompatible interests gain access to power and press their demands. Political and military leaders, who are often embattled remnants of the old authoritarian order, realize that to succeed that they must rally the masses behind a national cause. The result is invariably aggressive rhetoric and policies, which often drag countries into confrontation and war. Noteworthy examples range from Napoleon III’s France, Wilhelmine Germany, and Taisho Japan to those in today’s newspapers, like Armenia and Azerbaijan and Milosevic’s Serbia. The democratic peace, it turns out, has little to do with democracy.

An argument that constitutional liberalism is actually responsible for the peace between democracies rather than democracy itself. 
## Overall Thoughts

The underlying idea of the article seems to be that constitutional liberalism is actually the source of much of the positive effects that are typically attributed to democracy in the western world.
