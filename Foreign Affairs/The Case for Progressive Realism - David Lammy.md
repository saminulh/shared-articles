The long Conservative regime has turned Britain inward, e.g., Brexit, in a time of growing instability in the global order. The author, Labour Party's shadow Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Affairs, advocates for progressive realism:
> Progressive realism advocates using realist means to pursue pro- gressive ends. For the British government, that requires tough-minded honesty about the United Kingdom, the balance of power, and the state of the world. But instead of using the logic of realism solely to accumulate power, progressive realism uses it in service of just goals— for example, countering climate change, defending democracy, and advancing the world’s economic development. It is the pursuit of ideals without delusions about what is achievable. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=3&selection=13,0,20,43|page 3]])

The realist vein starts with Ernest Bevin, foreign secretary during WWII negotiations:
* Advocated for Berlin to the Americans during the Soviet Blockade of 1948-49
* Convinced Atlee to acquire nukes for Britain
* Convinced Truman to join a NATO alliance

The progressive vein starts with Robin Cook, foreign secretary during 1997, who called for a foreign policy with an "ethical dimension":
* Made climate change a focus
* Mainstreamed human rights
* Championed a ban on landmines
* Got British allies to fight against the war crimes in Kosovo
* Believed that foreign policy should benefit all

> Yet Cook’s vision of adding more ethics to foreign policy at times snagged on the limits of idealism, particularly when it came to hard choices about arms exports. But these limits do not mean idealism has no place in foreign policy. Just because someone is progressive does not mean that person cannot be a realist. Governments, likewise, do not have to choose between values and interests. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=4&selection=42,34,47,61|page 4]])

Question: What happens when values and interests conflict? What do you choose? 

> A British government that adheres to progressive realism will not repeat \[the errors of early 2000s foreign policy\]. That said, the last decade has made it clear that inaction has high costs, too \[e.g., Syria\]. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=5&selection=59,0,63,47|page 5]])

Question: The lack of Syrian intervention was in part due to the bungled intervention in Libya (if I recall the Shapiro lectures correctly). And who's to say that intervening in Syria wouldn't be a similar mess? It seems tricky to ensure that you will always pick the right moments to intervene in. Maybe the progressive realist claim is that their criteria for intervention (being realistically grounded) will tend to produce good outcomes. However, there were also realist reasons to avoid Syrian intervention too (such as preventing free-loading).

> As Fiona Hill, a former senior director of the U.S. National Security Council, said in 898G, the war has become a proxy for a rebellion of “the rest” against the West. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=6&selection=37,25,42,47|page 6]])

Comment: This gives the vibes of "you're either with us or against us." Doesn't really leave the room for neutrality.

Proposals for global security:
* Develop closer (and formal) foreign and security cooperation with the EU
* Convince the Americans that Europe can protect itself
* Reinforce commitment to NATO
* Separate agreements with specific EU countries
* Support Ukraine as long as the war lasts
	* "Once Ukraine has prevailed, the United Kingdom should play a leading role in securing Ukraine’s place in NATO" (wild presumption)
* Increase focus on the Indopacific
	* Need to go beyond AUKUS
	* Deepen ties with Japan and South Korea
	* Trade deal with India
* With China, "The United Kingdom must instead adopt a more consistent strategy, one that simultaneously challenges, competes against, and cooperates with China as appropriate" (this consistent strategy seems ripe for inconsistency)
	* Recognize the threats of China while also recognizing the necessity of cooperation for global goals
* Support re-building Gaza, call for international law to be follows, recognize Palestine as a state
* Fairer transitions to greener economies
* Global technology guardrails against the dangers of AI
* Help develop countries in Africa by emphasizing trade

Proposals for economic development:
* Starmer pledges fastest growth in the G7
* Priority for every ambassador to promote investment into the UK
* Business advisory council to hear the needs of companies
* No rejoining the EU, the Single Market, or the Customs Union

Climate policies:
* Invest in a green transition, especially in the face of the US's Inflation Reduction Act and the EU's Green Deal
* A clean power alliance, a reverse OPEC
* Stopping issuing new licenses to explore oil and gas in the North Sea

> Progressive policy without realism is empty idealism. Realism without a sense of progress can become cynical and tactical. But when progressives act realistically and practically, they change the world. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=11&selection=62,1,67,0|page 11]])
## Final Thoughts

It feels to me like Lammy is using the word "realism" in the general sense of being realistic about things rather than the more specific foreign policy notion of anarchic system of self-interested states. Overall, his "progressive realism" framework seems non-predictive in the crucial moments and his policies seem like unexciting center-left/neoliberal policies. Also, some of his strategies seem like the same old economic idealism, such as his approach to developing Africa through emphasizing trade.

Another interesting thing is that, while calling his framework "progressive", he doesn't really advocate for human rights policies (at home or abroad) except for calling for international law to be followed in the Israel-Palestine war. Rather, he says "If progressives forget that diplomacy means working with those who do not always share democratic values, it will hurt British interests." It's not an unreasonable position to have necessarily, but it seems to stretch the definition of progressive.
