The long Conservative regime has turned Britain inward, e.g., Brexit, in a time of growing instability in the global order. The author, Labour Party's shadow Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Affairs, advocates for progressive realism:
> Progressive realism advocates using realist means to pursue pro- gressive ends. For the British government, that requires tough-minded honesty about the United Kingdom, the balance of power, and the state of the world. But instead of using the logic of realism solely to accumulate power, progressive realism uses it in service of just goals— for example, countering climate change, defending democracy, and advancing the world’s economic development. It is the pursuit of ideals without delusions about what is achievable. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=3&selection=13,0,20,43|page 3]])

The realist vein starts with Ernest Bevin, foreign secretary during WWII negotiations:
* Advocated for Berlin to the Americans during the Soviet Blockade of 1948-49
* Convinced Atlee to acquire nukes for Britain
* Convinced Truman to join a NATO alliance

The progressive vein starts with Robin Cook, foreign secretary during 1997, who called for a foreign policy with an "ethical dimension":
* Made climate change a focus
* Mainstreamed human rights
* Championed a ban on landmines
* Got British allies to fight against the war crimes in Kosovo

> Yet Cook’s vision of adding more ethics to foreign policy at times snagged on the limits of idealism, particularly when it came to hard choices about arms exports. But these limits do not mean idealism has no place in foreign policy. Just because someone is progressive does not mean that person cannot be a realist. Governments, likewise, do not have to choose between values and interests. ([[the_case_for_progressive_realism.pdf#page=4&selection=42,34,47,61|page 4]])

Question: What happens when values and interests conflict? What do you choose?

Rough definition of progressive realism.

> A progressive realism worth its name begins by being honest about assumptions the West made in the past that turned out to be wrong. The broad consensus that economic globalization would inevitably breed liberal democratic values proved false.

The failure of Fukuyama's "End of History" hypothesis

> Progressive realism acknowledges that, at times in the twentieth century, Western powers undermined the sovereignty of weaker states, especially in the global South. But in the twenty-first century, a Labour government would see its mission as supporting states’ sovereignty against forces such as Russian neoimperialism, climate change, and corruption. This is why progressive realism seeks the same thing for Ukraine, Israel, and Palestine: for each to be a sovereign, secure, and internationally recognized state, at peace with its neighbors.

Progressive realism recognises sovereignty over the (coercive) spread of liberal order. 

> Progressive policy without realism is empty idealism. Realism without a sense of progress can become cynical and tactical. But when progressives act realistically and practically, they change the world.
