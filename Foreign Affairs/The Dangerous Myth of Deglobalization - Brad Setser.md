# Excerpts
> a closer look at economic data shows that even though governments have increasingly adopted policies aimed at strengthening their own resilience, the world economy is still evolving to become more, not less, globalized in key ways—and more dependent on Chinese supply in particular. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=3&selection=75,13,79,14|page 3]])
- Even though policies are increasingly less pro-globalization, the world economy is becoming more globalized in important ways and more dependent on China.

>  But the growth in trade with China also reects the fact that China is simply producing things—high-tech exports such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, and vital electronic and battery components—at a price point few can match. Between 2019 and 2023, China’s manufacturing surplus rose by about a percentage point of global GDP; it is now far larger than the surpluses run by Germany and Japan, the world’s other manufacturing powerhouses. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=3&selection=82,60,123,40|page 3]])
- Manufacturing and high-tech exports are growing in China.

>  Policymakers’ efforts to defend globalization by equating more global trade flows with increased efficiency tend to ignore the ways reality is more complex: for example, even those pursuing a healthy form of globalization will need to work to reduce multinational corporations’ tax avoidance ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=4&selection=33,13,44,13|page 4]])
- Tax avoidance persists as a problem for those attempting more sustainable globalization.

> Countries lacking preferential access to the U.S. market can still do incredibly well with the WTO’s standard trade terms. In fact, U.S. imports from Southeast Asia have soared in the past half dozen years. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=4&selection=84,6,86,69|page 4]])
- Because tariffs under the WTO's standards are already low, specific trade deals have little impact.

> Surprisingly, \[Chinese\] data reveal a much smaller decline in direct trade with the United States and a steep rise in Chinese exports to countries that are now exporting more to the United States. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=5&selection=72,25,74,70|page 5]])
- Chinese data shows that while direct trade to the US is down, there is a large rise in exports to countries that are in turn exporting to the US.

> Over the five years between the end of 2018 and the end of 2023, China’s exports of manufactured goods increased by 40 percent, from $2.5 trillion to $3.5 trillion, much more than the roughly 15 percent increase between 2013 and 2018. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=6&selection=30,13,36,31|page 6]])
- Chinese exports of manufactured goods are growing rapidly.

> After the end of a property boom that lasted more than a decade, China responded to weakening internal demand by investing more in the production of manufactured goods for export. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=7&selection=15,71,36,43|page 7]])
- After China's property boom ended, there was weak internal demand which was supplemented by investing in producing and exporting manufactured goods.

>  Lael Brainard, the director of the U.S. National Economic Council, put it well: “China’s industrial capacity and its exports in certain sectors are now so large that they can undermine the viability of investments in the U.S. and other countries. … Markets need reliable demand signals and fair competition for the best firms and technologies to be able to innovate and invest in clean energy and other sectors. The Chinese government has made clear that China’s massive investments in electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries are an intentional strategy to effectively capture these sectors.” ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=8&selection=36,38,70,32|page 8]])
- US policymakers are worried about China capturing certain sectors, particularly in green technology.

> Changes in the way pharmaceutical companies behave are illuminating: U.S. pharmaceutical rms now often sell the rights to profit from promising new drugs to subsidiaries located in low-tax jurisdictions. These drugs are manufactured abroad and then sold at a high price in the United States. As a result, the major U.S. pharmaceutical companies—and other multinationals—now report earning almost all their profits abroad and pay little or no domestic corporate income tax.  ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=9&selection=28,15,44,1|page 9]])

- A tax avoidance strategy for pharmaceutical companies is to sell the rights to profit to subsidiaries in low-tax countries and so they report earnings as coming entirely from abroad.

> Ireland is also the biggest global market for the export of U.S. research-and-development services. e Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands are the biggest export markets for U.S. financial services, and Bermuda is the United States’ main international supplier of insurance services ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=10&selection=10,43,19,49|page 10]])
- There is a constellation of countries that "export" American services to the US.

> A 2017 International Monetary Fund study showed that the resilience of FDI flows in the wake of the 2008–09 global financial crisis can largely be credited to a steady rise in FDI flows through centers of corporate tax avoidance ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=10&selection=19,51,31,46|page 10]])
^580ba7
- An IMF study shows that FDI was resilient to the 2008 financial crisis because of corporate tax avoidance.

> In 2015, the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agreed to change their tax regulations to try to make it harder for companies to locate their profits in zero-tax jurisdictions. But these changes, which were implemented at the end of 2020, have not curbed tax-avoidance-driven globalization. Following a tax strategy pioneered by Apple, a number of major U.S. companies directed their Irish subsidiaries to buy their affected subsidiaries in zero-tax jurisdictions, effectively “Ireland-shoring” their intellectual property while simultaneously generating large depreciation allowances that lower their effective tax rates in Ireland. ([[the-dangerous-myth-of-deglobalization.pdf#page=10&selection=32,0,71,28|page 10]])

## Questions and Comments
- Re [[#^555f52]]: I'm a bit confused about how this works. Why would it be abroad if you are still at the end of the day selling to American customers?
- Re [[#^580ba7]]: Don't quite understand how this works.
- Re [[#^61910d]]: This is interesting.
## Final Thoughts
Interesting article arguing essentially that the current thinking on (de)globalization is not quite accurate and offers a more nuanced picture. A few interesting facts about China's trade and tax avoidance policy.
