## Notes
[[Hamas]]' Objectives with [[October 7 attack|Oct. 7]]:
* Put [[Palestine]] back in international focus (irrespective of destruction of Gaza)
* Thwart normalization pact between between [[Israel]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]
	* Such a pact would promote Palestinian moderates at the cost of Hamas
* Relieve themselves of the burden of governance
* Reconciliation with [[Fatah]] and the [[Palestinian Authority|PA]]
	* Talks of reconciliation held in early May, hosted by China (wtf is this about?)
* Wants a [[Hezbollah]] model in Gaza:
	* "it hopes to wield political and military dominance in Gaza and ultimately the West Bank without bearing any of the accountability that comes from ruling alone." ([[what-hamas-wants-in-postwar-gaza-2024-05-10-11-49.pdf#page=3&selection=88,12,90,29|page 3]])
### Aftermath of the [[2021 Israel-Palestine Crisis]]
* Hamas was well-entrenched and well-funded internationally
*  [[Yahya Sinwar]] proposed that Hamas would continue to aim for the eradication of Israel but was willing to enter into a long-term truce.
	* Many demands (settlements, releasing prisoners, right of return)
	* Temporary truce
	* For the purposes of achieving unity among Palestinians (under Hamas)
* [[Yahya Sinwar|Sinwar]] was mentioning [[Iran]] and [[Hezbollah]]
* Hamas held a conference for post-Israel plans
	* Called for replacing the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] with a "Council for the Liberation of Palestine"
		* Would include non-Palestinian Arabs!
* Began planning Oct. 7
	* Hoping it would lead to chain reaction that would eventually destroy Israel
	* SH: So it seems like they are really hoping for escalation, e.g., with [[Hezbollah]] and [[Iran]] joining the fray in earnest.
### Prelude to [[October 7 attack|October 7]]
* Israel was "buying calm" through Qatari funds, hoping to decrease Hamas support in Gaza
* In July 2023, "72 percent of Gazans agreed that “Hamas has been unable to improve the lives of Palestinians in Gaza” and that 70 percent supported the proposal that Hamas’s rival, the PA, take over security in Gaza" ([[what-hamas-wants-in-postwar-gaza-2024-05-10-11-49.pdf#page=5&selection=34,23,37,4|page 5]])
	* Indicative the Hamas was weak
* Israeli-Saudi normalization was underway and Saudis were pressing for a two-state solution (which Hamas of course cannot support)
* Rising instability in Israel itself: protests over judicial reforms and clashes in al-Aqsa mosque.
### The Plans
* Hoping to draw in Iran and Hezbollah
* Planned to link up with West Bank fighters (Hamas militants were carrying enough supplies for a few days
	* Hoped to reach Tel Aviv and connect with militants in Hebron
* Wanted to provoke the land invasion of Gaza and high Palestinian casualities
	* "[[Ismail Haniyeh]], bluntly confirmed in a video address days after October 7: 'We are the ones who need this blood, so it awakens within us the revolutionary spirit, so it awakens within us resolve, so it awakens with us the spirit of challenge and \[pushes us\] to move forward.'" ([[what-hamas-wants-in-postwar-gaza-2024-05-10-11-49.pdf#page=7&selection=14,48,20,33|page 7]])
### The Attack
* Hamas infiltrated with more than they anticipated
* Two waves followed them: first included [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] and [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and the second include unaffiliated Gazans
	* SH: the language here is weirdly vague
* Did not set off a regional war
	* Hamas is okay with this as this still gets the ball rolling and Hamas is now free of the burden of governance.
### The Aftermath
* Hamas has begun the groundwork to take over the PLO
	* SH: Insane!
* [[Khalil Al-Hayya]] "has floated the idea of a five-year truce with Israel based on the armistice lines that existed before the 1967 war and on a unified Palestinian government that controls both the West Bank and Gaza Strip." ([[what-hamas-wants-in-postwar-gaza-2024-05-10-11-49.pdf#page=8&selection=77,4,109,71|page 8]])
	* SH: I wonder how in the world he thinks he can pull off the Israeli part of this plan
* Since December, Hamas has been meeting with factions of Fatah opposed to [[Mahmoud Abbas]]
* On April 21, Hamas proposed restructuring the PLO to include all factions
	* SH: need to learn how the PLO works
* Aiming for the Hezbollah model
	* Nominally part of the state, allowing some influence on policy and spending
	* Completely autonomous and in charge of its own military
* Just surviving is sufficient for [[Yahya Sinwar|Sinwar]]: Hezbollah was not destroyed by Israel in the [[2006 Lebanon War]] and enjoys increased stature as a result.
## Final Thoughts
This article lays out the story that Hamas hopes to get a Hezbollah-style arrangement through the October 7th attack and the ensuing war. By that, it means that Hamas will have a say in the postwar government while conducting its own military endeavours, all while free from the burdens of governance.

The most interesting things about this article are the political dealings regarding Hamas and the PLO that I had been unaware and this definitely seems like something we should look into deeper. Also, getting a better understanding of Hezbollah and their place in Lebanon would also be worthwhile.
