## Notes
> \[A large number of autocratic regimes\] were generally succeeded by regimes that at least aspired to be democratic, giving rise to the phenomenon that Samuel P. Huntington termed the "third wave" of democratization.

* A coherent story here could be that this third wave brought about democracies that were (for presumably correlated reasons) not ready for liberalism. Thus, this new yield of democracies would be fundamentally different from the success stories that came before. 

> Outside of Africa, few of these aspiring new democracies have su#ered outright reversions to authoritarianism. But many…fall short of providing the protection of individual liberties and adherence to the rule of law commonly found in the long- established democracies

>  While many new electoral democracies fall short of liberalism, on the whole, countries that hold free elections are overwhelmingly more liberal than those that do not, and countries that protect civil liberties are overwhelmingly more likely to hold free elections than those that do not.

- Curious to see the data here

>  Starting from the democratic side, elections would seem to require the guarantee of certain civil liberties-the freedoms of speech, association, and assembly-if they are to be genuinely free and fair.

- His own example of ancient democracies wouldn’t satisfy this criteria I guess?

> If we begin instead with the human rights mandated by the liberal tradition, these are generally held today to include some kind of right to electoral participation.

- I kind of feel like we are just playing semantic games here? Like this argument would imply that liberal non-democracies are impossible, which is not particularly helpful given that we have already discussed a bunch…
- Update: “One may regard this as a formal or even merely de!nitional link between liberalism and electoral democracy, but it points to a more profound kinship.” Sure, however that kinship might be a later-stage consideration.

> For the political doctrine at the source of liberalism also contains a deeply egalitarian and majoritarian dimension…. \[N\]o man has a natural claim to rule over another, and its clear corollary is that the rule of man over man can be justified only on the basis of a mutual agreement or "compact."

> Reliance on elected representation in the legislature, the key political institution of modern liberal democracy, was understood by its proponents as a decisive departure from ancient democracy.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This article was written in 1998 and is a direct response to [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria]].

## Reading Notes

>Drawing upon this distinction, Zakaria recommends that Western policymakers not only increase their efforts to foster constitutional liberalism but diminish their support for elections, and suggests that "liberal autocracies" are preferable to illiberal democracies.

To me this claim seems to be a bit stronger than what he actually said. I don't think he said we should necessarily diminish support for elections but rather de-emphasise it (and perhaps in certain conditions don't recommend it).

> Although "unpacking" the component elements of modern liberal democracy is a crucial first step toward comprehending its character, overstating the disjunction between liberalism and democracy can easily lead to new misunderstanding. While many new electoral democracies fall short of liberalism, on the whole, countries that hold free elections are overwhelmingly more liberal than those that do not, and countries that protect civil liberties are overwhelmingly more likely to hold free elections than those that do not. This is not simply an accident. It is the result of powerful intrinsic links between electoral democracy and a liberal order.

This is perhaps the main thesis of the article, which is that Zakaria overstates the distinction between electoral democracy and liberalism, which the author argues are distinct yet intrinsically linked. 

>Later, in Federalist 63, acknowledging that the principle of representation was not unknown to the ancients, Madison states: "The true distinction between ancient democracies and the American governments lies in the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity, from any share in the latter, and not in the total exclusion of the representatives of the people from the administration of the former." (Italics in original). In short, modern liberal democracy from the outset was inclined to minimize the direct political role of the people. In this sense, Zakaria is on solid ground in stressing the anti-majoritarian aspects of liberalism.

>In part, of course, the substitution of representative government for direct democracy was justified by the larger size of modern states, which made it impractical for the whole people to assemble. But this very fact had led thinkers like Montesquieu and Rousseau to conclude that democratic or republican government was possible only in a small state, and Rousseau to assert that "the moment that a people gives itself representatives, it is no longer free." 

>There was, however, another ground used to justify representative government. In Madison's words, it "would refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations." In other words, elected representatives are expected to be superior to the average citizen. In the ancient democracies, by contrast, most public officials were chosen by lot

>In The Politics, Aristotle characterizes lot as the democratic mode of choosing officials, and election as the oligarchic mode. Montesquieu reiterates this judgment, adding, "The suffrage by lot is a method of electing that offends no one, but animates each citizen with the pleasing hope of serving his country." Where elections are used instead, those chosen tend to be richer, better educated, and more talented than most of their fellow citizens. In this light, representative or electoral democracy, besides largely eliminating the people from direct participation in self-government, also seems to constitute an aristocratic deviation from political equality.

Interesting history of democratic thought.

>There are only a few countries-principally Islamic monarchies-in which anything like traditional rule still holds sway. In these cases, perhaps the nineteenth-century European model can to some extent be emulated. Elsewhere, existing autocracies-or the regimes that aspiring democracies have replaced-are generally ideological rather than traditional regimes and espouse some kind of egalitarian doctrine of their own. In a post-communist or formerly one-party socialist regime, what principle could be accepted as a basis for restricting suffrage? And what legitimate mechanism other than election could be used for deciding who will rule?

The author argues that most modern autocracies are ideological rather than traditional and thus the ninteenth-century transition of European liberal autocracies to democracies likely can not be emulated. 

>This, however, is a lesson that most Western governments, inherently inclined toward diplomatic caution, hardly need to be taught. In fact, their adherence to such a policy is a frequent complaint of those who accuse Western governments of being too friendly with nondemocratic governments, especially in the Arab world.

This is hilarious (in a sad way) given what will soon transpire. 
## Overall Thoughts

This article agrees with Zakaria that democracy is distinct from liberalism but makes the claim that they are still intrinsically linked and feed one another, and the nineteenth-century European model of transitioning from liberal autocracy to liberal democracy is unlikely to apply today. 

I don't know enough historical details to verify this argument but I thought of a sort of 
"Burkean" critique of both the thesis of this article and article its responding to. Perhaps the transition being natural and gradual is equally (if not more important) than the details of the transition. This would explain why the European model and/or the economic liberalisation of the East Asian autocracies (especially China much after this article was written) may have been more successful than countries which tried to make rapid transitions.
