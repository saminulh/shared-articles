# Sammy (05/04/2024)
## Notes
> \[A large number of autocratic regimes\] were generally succeeded by regimes that at least aspired to be democratic, giving rise to the phenomenon that Samuel P. Huntington termed the "third wave" of democratization. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=2&selection=17,1,22,64|page 2]])
* A coherent story here could be that this third wave brought about democracies that were (for presumably correlated reasons) not ready for liberalism. Thus, this new yield of democracies would be fundamentally different from the success stories that came before. 

> Outside of Africa, few of these aspiring new democracies have su#ered outright reversions to authoritarianism. But many…fall short of providing the protection of individual liberties and adherence to the rule of law commonly found in the long- established democracies ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=2&selection=28,0,40,23|page 2]])

>  While many new electoral democracies fall short of liberalism, on the whole, countries that hold free elections are overwhelmingly more liberal than those that do not, and countries that protect civil liberties are overwhelmingly more likely to hold free elections than those that do not. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=5&selection=28,36,36,58|page 5]])
- Curious to see the data here

>  Starting from the democratic side, elections would seem to require the guarantee of certain civil liberties-the freedoms of speech, association, and assembly-if they are to be genuinely free and fair. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=5&selection=45,45,51,51|page 5]])
- His own example of ancient democracies wouldn’t satisfy this criteria I guess?

> If we begin instead with the human rights mandated by the liberal tradition, these are generally held today to include some kind of right to electoral participation. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=6&selection=0,13,4,46|page 6]])
- I kind of feel like we are just playing semantic games here? Like this argument would imply that liberal non-democracies are impossible, which is not particularly helpful given that we have already discussed a bunch…
- Update: “One may regard this as a formal or even merely de!nitional link between liberalism and electoral democracy, but it points to a more profound kinship.” Sure, however that kinship might be a later-stage consideration.

> For the political doctrine at the source of liberalism also contains a deeply egalitarian and majoritarian dimension…. \[N\]o man has a natural claim to rule over another, and its clear corollary is that the rule of man over man can be justified only on the basis of a mutual agreement or "compact." ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=6&selection=34,0,36,45|page 6]])
* This does not justify majoritarianism: [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski#^53c0ea]]

> Reliance on elected representation in the legislature, the key political institution of modern liberal democracy, was understood by its proponents as a decisive departure from ancient democracy. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=7&selection=43,6,48,0|page 7]])

> They write in favor of a "republic" ("a government in which the scheme of representation takes place") ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=7&selection=61,0,62,33|page 7]])
- What’s going on between this definition of “republic” and the Kantian one mentioned in [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria]]?

> In other words, elected representatives are expected to be superior to the average citizen. In the ancient democracies, by contrast, most public officials were chosen by lot ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=9&selection=19,47,27,18|page 9]])

> In \[ancient democracy\], the citizens entitled to participate in public affairs invariably represented a relatively small percentage of the overall population.  ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=10&selection=0,0,6,12|page 10]])

> these kinds of exclusions were always in tension with the underlying principle of liberalism-namely, that all human beings are by nature free and equal. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=10&selection=22,29,26,42|page 10]])

> But what is to be done in the case of a people that is not, at least for the time being, capable of making democracy work? Mill's answer to this question was colonial rule. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=13&selection=51,30,55,65|page 13]])
- It sort of felt like Zakaria was to some extent [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria#^a24581|implying this as well]] (or at least that this strategy was quite successful in the hands of the British).

> There are only a few countries-principally Islamic monarchies-in which anything like traditional rule still holds sway. In these cases, perhaps the nineteenth-century European model can to some extent be emulated. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=15&selection=59,0,62,60|page 15]])
- Really wild, maybe we can hope this is what is happening in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

> Elsewhere, existing autocracies-or the regimes that aspiring democracies have replaced-are generally ideological rather than traditional regimes and espouse some kind of egalitarian doctrine of their own.  ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=16&selection=4,10,10,23|page 16]])
- This is a good point, maybe nowadays democracy is a necessary vehicle (in most cases) for liberal vehicle.

> the fiasco of the U.S. attempt at political (as opposed to humanitarian) intervention in Somalia, along with the proliferation of states that might have been candidates for such costly international reconstruction operations, quickly made it clear that the political will for this kind of policy is lacking. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=16&selection=46,53,57,71|page 16]])
- I don't know much about the Somalia story, but in our time, Afghanistan is another great example of a neo-colonial strategy totally failing. Maybe the colonization strategy only works on a generational timescale (or maybe Afghanistan is particularly difficult, given the British's own historic failures).

> it would surely be questionable to assert that \[East Asian\] autocracies are genuinely constitutional or liberal, a fact that Zakaria himself seems to recognize by characterizing Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia not as "liberal" but only as "liberalizing" autocracies. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=17&selection=7,10,13,69|page 17]])
- This is a good point. Need to learn more about this, but I guess it is unclear which of liberalization or democratization is coming first there (especially with the difficulty in characterizing the democraticness of Singapore to begin with).

> the Singaporeans themselves, while claiming to practice democracy, acknowledge that their regime, to quote Singapore's U.N. Ambassador, Bilahari Kausikan, "has never pretended or aspired to be liberal." ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=17&selection=21,32,28,0|page 17]])

> Thus, despite Zakaria's talk of constitutionalism and individual rights, he seems to wind up taking the much more familiar view that authoritarian capitalist development is the most reliable road to eventual liberal democracy. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=17&selection=28,1,36,68|page 17]])
- The fact that this is "familiar" is really interesting. I suppose this is the logic of the American interventions on behalf of right-wing dictators during the Cold War (if we are to take them at face value).

>  As Mill noted, the same shortcomings that make a people poorly prepared for representative government are also likely to be found in its unelected rulers. Wise and benevolent despots are the exception, not the rule. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=18&selection=4,51,10,68|page 18]])

> although the number of new democracies in which candidates have succeeded on the basis of such appeals is far fewer than might have been expected ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=18&selection=34,55,40,8|page 18]])
- Interesting!

> African voters, for example, may often cast their ballots along ethnic or tribal lines, but in how many African countries have dictatorial governments achieved real ethnic accommodation, rather than merely the domination of some groups by others? Most new democracies are undoubtedly confronting severe challenges, but almost none of these would be overcome by abolishing elections. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=18&selection=46,0,48,67|page 18]])
- This is a good observation, but I don't think it really counters Zakaria's position (and maybe even bolsters it)--this really just says that adding democracy doesn't solve these issues in a way that adding liberalism might (which isn't to say that subtracting democracy would make it any better). I suppose the Zakaria position would argue to abolish election if there's reason to believe that that can help foster constitutional liberalism, but I don't know if that argument is being made (he does even advocate to [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria#^df9f47|"consolidate democracy where it has taken root"]]).

> In fact, their adherence to such a policy \[of not hastily pushing elections on fragile regimes\] is a frequent complaint of those who accuse Western governments of being too friendly with nondemocratic governments, especially in the Arab world. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=19&selection=29,19,35,15|page 19]])
- In some circumstances, Zakaria's position (on intervening on behalf of democracy) is the actual foreign policy position.

> This relatively recent innovation, first attempted in Nicaragua in 1990, combines peacemaking with democracy-building, but is driven primarily by the former goal. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=20&selection=2,0,13,0|page 20]])
- Also has had positive results in Cambodia, Mozambique, and El Salvador.
- The lesson here might be that a focus on a separate goal (here, peace) rather than democracy in and of itself is the way in which we should think about influence and intervention.

> But the overall trend, nonetheless, is for more and more countries to become and remain democratic. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=21&selection=26,60,30,29|page 21]])
- I don't think this is true anymore?

> Moreover, the historical record shows that countries that have had an earlier experience with democracy that failed are more likely to succeed in a subsequent attempt than countries with no previous democratic experience. So even if democracy breaks down, it can leave a legacy of hope for the future. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=21&selection=30,30,40,6|page 21]])
- Interesting.

> It is precisely the illiberal democracies that Zakaria maligns that are likely to be the most receptive audience for the promotion of constitutional liberalism that he recommends. ([[liberalism-and-democracy.pdf#page=22&selection=20,43,26,18|page 22]])
- A little skeptical of this claim, I think I'm still a bit inclined to believe that it these two things are pretty independent. I'm more partial to stories involving wealth and property rights, and constitutional liberalism as a means of those that have/want those things to protect it (we should read some of [[Institutions are a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth - Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James A. Robinson]]).
## Final Thoughts
A good supplement to [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria|Zakaria's piece]]. The biggest thing missing (IMO) from Zakaria's article is how to effect liberal and constitutional changes in regimes lacking it. He claims that we can do this by way of liberal autocracies, but I think Plattner makes good observations that in our day and age, this is a hard thing to conceptualize. And it is probably true that by and large, most liberal reforms have to be couched in democratic terms, because democratic language is ubiquitous (irrespective of democracy itself). I think the main idea of Zakaria's article is not incompatible with these observations, however, as it merely calls to prioritize liberal reform over democratic reform (at least in its weak form).

Ultimately still, it seems we are missing good tools for liberal reform in countries. Evidently we have tools for democracy and peace, but liberalism still seems elusive. Aside from the colonialism tool (which seems like a non-starter), I'm curious to learn what led to liberalization in Japan following WWII.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This article was written in 1998 and is a direct response to [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria]].

## Reading Notes

>Drawing upon this distinction, Zakaria recommends that Western policymakers not only increase their efforts to foster constitutional liberalism but diminish their support for elections, and suggests that "liberal autocracies" are preferable to illiberal democracies.

To me this claim seems to be a bit stronger than what he actually said. I don't think he said we should necessarily diminish support for elections but rather de-emphasise it (and perhaps in certain conditions don't recommend it).

> Although "unpacking" the component elements of modern liberal democracy is a crucial first step toward comprehending its character, overstating the disjunction between liberalism and democracy can easily lead to new misunderstanding. While many new electoral democracies fall short of liberalism, on the whole, countries that hold free elections are overwhelmingly more liberal than those that do not, and countries that protect civil liberties are overwhelmingly more likely to hold free elections than those that do not. This is not simply an accident. It is the result of powerful intrinsic links between electoral democracy and a liberal order.

This is perhaps the main thesis of the article, which is that Zakaria overstates the distinction between electoral democracy and liberalism, which the author argues are distinct yet intrinsically linked. 

>Later, in Federalist 63, acknowledging that the principle of representation was not unknown to the ancients, Madison states: "The true distinction between ancient democracies and the American governments lies in the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity, from any share in the latter, and not in the total exclusion of the representatives of the people from the administration of the former." (Italics in original). In short, modern liberal democracy from the outset was inclined to minimize the direct political role of the people. In this sense, Zakaria is on solid ground in stressing the anti-majoritarian aspects of liberalism.

>In part, of course, the substitution of representative government for direct democracy was justified by the larger size of modern states, which made it impractical for the whole people to assemble. But this very fact had led thinkers like Montesquieu and Rousseau to conclude that democratic or republican government was possible only in a small state, and Rousseau to assert that "the moment that a people gives itself representatives, it is no longer free." 

>There was, however, another ground used to justify representative government. In Madison's words, it "would refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations." In other words, elected representatives are expected to be superior to the average citizen. In the ancient democracies, by contrast, most public officials were chosen by lot

>In The Politics, Aristotle characterizes lot as the democratic mode of choosing officials, and election as the oligarchic mode. Montesquieu reiterates this judgment, adding, "The suffrage by lot is a method of electing that offends no one, but animates each citizen with the pleasing hope of serving his country." Where elections are used instead, those chosen tend to be richer, better educated, and more talented than most of their fellow citizens. In this light, representative or electoral democracy, besides largely eliminating the people from direct participation in self-government, also seems to constitute an aristocratic deviation from political equality.

Interesting history of democratic thought.

>There are only a few countries-principally Islamic monarchies-in which anything like traditional rule still holds sway. In these cases, perhaps the nineteenth-century European model can to some extent be emulated. Elsewhere, existing autocracies-or the regimes that aspiring democracies have replaced-are generally ideological rather than traditional regimes and espouse some kind of egalitarian doctrine of their own. In a post-communist or formerly one-party socialist regime, what principle could be accepted as a basis for restricting suffrage? And what legitimate mechanism other than election could be used for deciding who will rule?

The author argues that most modern autocracies are ideological rather than traditional and thus the ninteenth-century transition of European liberal autocracies to democracies likely can not be emulated. 

>This, however, is a lesson that most Western governments, inherently inclined toward diplomatic caution, hardly need to be taught. In fact, their adherence to such a policy is a frequent complaint of those who accuse Western governments of being too friendly with nondemocratic governments, especially in the Arab world.

This is hilarious (in a sad way) given what will soon transpire. 
## Overall Thoughts

This article agrees with Zakaria that democracy is distinct from liberalism but makes the claim that they are still intrinsically linked and feed one another, and the nineteenth-century European model of transitioning from liberal autocracy to liberal democracy is unlikely to apply today. 

I don't know enough historical details to verify this argument but I thought of a sort of 
"Burkean" critique of both the thesis of this article and article its responding to. Perhaps the transition being natural and gradual is equally (if not more important) than the details of the transition. This would explain why the European model and/or the economic liberalisation of the East Asian autocracies (especially China much after this article was written) may have been more successful than countries which tried to make rapid transitions.
