## BDS Boycott Guidelines

> [!quote]
> People of conscience around the world are rightfully shattered, enraged, and sometimes feeling powerless about Israel’s \#GazaGenocide. Many feel compelled to boycott any and all products and services of companies tied in any way to Israel. The proliferation of extensive “boycott lists” on social media is a result of this. The question is how to make boycotts effective and actually have an impact in holding corporations accountable for their complicity in the suffering of Palestinians? 
> 
> The BDS movement uses the historically successful method of **targeted boycotts** inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the US Civil Rights movement, the Indian anti-colonial struggle, among others worldwide. 
> 
> We must strategically focus on a relatively **smaller number** of [carefully selected companies](https://bdsmovement.net/BDS-Guide-Strategic-Campaigning) and products for maximum impact. We need to target companies that play a clear and direct role in Israel’s crimes and where there is **real potential for winning,** as was the case with, among others, G4S, Veolia, Orange, Ben & Jerry’s and Pillsbury. Compelling large, complicit companies, through strategic and context-sensitive boycott and divestment campaigns, to end their complicity in Israeli apartheid and war crimes against Palestinians sends a very powerful message to hundreds of other complicit companies that “your time will come, so get out before it’s too late!”
> 
> **Many of the prohibitively long lists going viral on social media do the exact opposite of this strategic and impactful approach. They include hundreds of companies, many without credible evidence of their connection to Israel’s regime of oppression against Palestinians. Many do not have clear demands to the companies as to what we expect them to do to end the boycott, making them ineffective.**

I think this is a good example of (at least an attempt of) effective politics. I notice this contrasts with many "cancellations" I have seen on tiktok and twitter. For example the K-pop star Yunjin from Le Sserafim [came under fire](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-03-12/entertainment/kpop/Le-Sserafims-Huh-Yunjin-under-fire-for-drinking-proIsrael-Starbucks/2000191) for drinking starbucks (which is not on the list). 

## BDS Campaigning Strategy

> [!quote]
> We do BDS because we want to win and build power to affect policy change in order to achieve Palestinian rights ultimately, and not to merely score points and feel good about symbolic gestures. This means forcing the company or institution to end its complicity with Israel’s apartheid regime, for example, through divestment from the Israeli market like [French telecommunications company Orange](https://bdsmovement.net/news/orange-drops-israel-affiliate-following-inspiring-bds-campaign) did in 2016. Only through sustained, cumulative, growing and mainstreaming successes can BDS achieve its objectives— which are freedom, justice and equality.

A commitment to effective politics.

> You might be surprised by how far good faith engagement, based on sharing accurate information and compelling moral appeals, can in some cases take you, particularly in smaller communities, before escalating to a larger public pressure campaign.
> 
> In most cases, however, strategic pressure is the only effective way. For example, when the Portland, Oregon, chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and other allies ran a campaign asking the Portland Trail Blazers to end their sponsorship agreement with the Israeli army’s sniper scope supplier Leupold and Stevens, they first sent private letters to the Blazers organization explaining their concerns and requesting a meeting to talk further about the partnership. This tactic did not work, and they then escalated to a public, year-long pressure campaign, [which they won](https://truthout.org/articles/a-bds-campaign-tackles-the-sports-industry-in-portland-and-wins/)! But they had to make sure to do their due diligence first, as that in itself shows good faith and can win over many bystanders.

This again seems NOT to be modus operandi for most of the "online left".
