### Preface to the 1882 Russian Edition:
US and Europe relations completely upended between 1847 to 1882
* From absorbing surplus workers to threatening European agricultural industry.
* By the time of 1882, it was evident (but not yet realized) that US industry would take over

Marx and Engels wondering about [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=5&selection=39,38,46,85|the issue that Russia didn't industrialize like the Western Europeans]]. Resolves that the [obshchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obshchina) of Russian peasant communes may serve as a baseline for communists writ large.

### Preface to the 1888 English Edition:
[[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=8&selection=52,11,67,1|In 1847, Socialists were quacks and "educated," while the Communists were the working class]]

### Manifesto
#### Bourgeois and Proletarians
> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=15&selection=4,0,5,28|Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms.]]

Feudal industry was dominated by closed guilds, but growing demand led to a manufacturing middle class, and then industrial middle class

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=15&selection=71,84,73,12|The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.]]

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=16&selection=6,94,8,39|In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.]]

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=16&selection=125,0,125,52|In one word, it [the bourgeois] creates a world after its own image.]]
* The bourgeois have become God lol.

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=18&selection=21,60,23,29|the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race.]]

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=18&selection=40,0,41,93|Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.]]
* I thought the Victorians upended this in terms of reinforcing gender roles
* Conversely, it seems like the Communist countries were the ones for whom sex stopped mattering as much

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=20&selection=36,76,38,35|[The proletarians] have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.]]

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=21&selection=4,20,6,28|[The bourgeoisie] is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.]]

#### Proletarians and Communists
> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=22&selection=11,1,15,95|The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.]]

> [[communist-manifesto.pdf#page=27&selection=9,0,11,29|When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character.]]
