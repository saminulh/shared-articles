## Notes
> I use the term liberal to mean a political system in which individual and group liberties are well protected and in which there exist autonomous spheres of civil society and private life, insulated from state control.  ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=91,18,99,43|page 42]])

> Up to a point consistent with the principles of constitutionalism and representative democracy, government is better when it is more democratic. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=129,0,131,48|page 42]])
* How to think about the what should be delegated into the constitutional vs. the democratic?

> There are certain economic, social, and cultural conditions for democracy to be viable, but they are often overstated, and we should be cautious about positing them as "prerequisites." ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=182,3,184,49|page 42]])
- This point about overstating the conditions is interesting. I wonder how much harder a liberal democracy is to achieve vs. "just" a democracy.

> Increasingly in the twentieth century, the freedoms of the individual to think, believe, worship, speak, publish, inquire, associate, and become informed, and the freedoms from torture, arbitrary arrest, and unlawful detention—not to mention enslavement and genocide—are recognized as universal and inalienable human rights. . . . ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=18,23,43,29|page 43]])
- These require some amount of liberalism but not democracy *per se*. Are liberal non-democracies a thing? Maybe a constitutional or enlightened monarchy? (Update: this is discussed right after lol-- [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria]] seems interesting)

> In times of very limited education and political consciousness, when the franchise could be confined to a narrow elite, liberal autocracy was possible. In today’s world, it is an illusion, a historical anachronism. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=94,0,98,20|page 43]])

> Severe, persistent socioeconomic inequality may well be (as some scholars find) a major threat to polit- ical democracy. But to establish this, we must first have a measure of democracy that is limited to features of the political system. For an e¤ort exhibiting this approach (and finding), see Zehra F. Arat, Democracy and Human Rights in Developing Countries (Boulder, Colo.: Lynne Rienner, 1991). For a critique of the incorporation of socioeconomic criteria into the defini- tion of democracy, see Terry Lynn Karl, ‘‘Dilemmas of Democratization in Latin America,’’ Comparative Pol- itics 23, no. 1 (1990): 2 ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=44&selection=98,4,109,54|page 44]])
- Interesting to look into these
### Electoral Democracy
> However, Schumpeter’s concise expression has required periodic elabo- ration (or what Collier and Levitsky call "precising") to avoid inclusion of cases that do not fit the implicit meaning. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=44&selection=90,0,90,21|page 44]])
- Curious to see these edge cases!

> The seminal elaboration \[of Schumpeter's conception\] is Dahl’s conception of polyarchy, which has two overt dimensions: opposition (organized contestation through regu- lar, free, and fair elections) and participation (the right of virtually all adults to vote and contest for o‰ce). Yet embedded in these two dimensions is a third, without which the first two cannot be truly meaningful: civil liberty. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=4,0,14,26|page 45]])

> \with the proviso that real contestation requires an opposition with some nontrivial chance of winning office and that the chief executive office and legislative seats are filled by contested elections ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=51,1,55,5|page 45]])
- The Singapore case is always interesting to me here--is the opposition sufficiently strong for this proviso to hold?

> On this and other conceptual and methodological problems, see Kenneth A. Bollen, "Political Democracy: Conceptual and Measurement Traps," in Inkeles, Measuring Democracy, 3–20. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=169,33,176,5|page 45]])
- Seems kind of interesting

> This flawed \[Schumpeterian\] conception of democracy privileges elections over other dimensions of democracy and ignores the degree to which multiparty elections (even if they are competitive and uncertain in outcome) may exclude significant portions of the population from contesting for power or advancing and defending their interests, or may leave significant arenas of decision making beyond the control of elected officials. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=46&selection=2,29,23,24|page 46]])
### Liberal Democracy
In addition to the requirements of an electoral democracy, this requires:
1. Vertical accountability of rulers to the ruled: "the absence of reserved domains of power for the military or other actors not accountable to the electorate, directly or indirectly."
2. "horizontal accountability of officeholders to one another; this con- strains executive power and so helps protect constitutionalism, legality, and the deliberative process"
	- "For the political quality of democracy, the most important additional mechanism of horizontal accountability is an autonomous judiciary." Interesting, probably something that Shapiro disagrees with.
3. "provisions for political and civic pluralism as well as for individual and group freedoms"
	- This necessitates a rule of law
	- "For an important explication of the rule of law and its related concepts, see Guillermo O’Donnell, "The (Un)Rule of Law in Latin America,""

> Citizens are politically equal under the law (even though they are invariably unequal in their political resources). ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=48&selection=173,0,175,21|page 48]])
* Determining this can be murky IMO. Laws can be such that they target non-protected proxies (and thus, nominally "equal") to disenfranchise certain people (and thus, de facto "unequal"). For example, poll taxes and efforts to reduce mail-in voting.

> Liberal democracies in particular ‘‘are and have to be constitutional democracies. The lack of a constitutional spirit, of an understanding of the centrality of constitutional stability, is one of the weaknesses’’ of many illiberal third-wave democracies in the postcommunist world, as well as in the Third World.45 ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=49&selection=18,30,36,2|page 49]])

> The distinction between political and civil freedom, on the one hand, and cultural freedom (or license), on the other, is often confused in the debate over whether democracy is inappro- priate for Asia (or East Asia, or Confucian Asia, or simply Singapore) because of incompatible values. Liberal democracy does not require the comprehensively exalted status of individual rights that obtains in Western Europe and especially the United States. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=49&selection=129,0,158,25|page 49]])
- Does Singapore have the sort of political and civil freedoms for liberal democracy? Interesting to read that Joseph Chan piece and Emmerson, "Region and Recalcitrance: Rethinking Democracy through Southeast Asia." (Update: He claims that Singapore does/did not meet the minimum freedoms requirement).
### Pseudodemocracies and Nondemocracies
> What distinguishes pseudodemocracies from other nondemocracies is that they tolerate legal alternative parties, which constitute at least somewhat real and independent opposition to the ruling party.  ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=50&selection=38,0,57,1|page 50]])

> Invariably, pseudodemocracies are illiberal, but they vary in their repressiveness and in their proximity to the threshold of elec- toral democracy (which Mexico could well cross in its next presidential election, in the year 2000). ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=50&selection=72,0,78,53|page 50]])
- Is Mexico considered a success in this respect now lol?
## Final Thoughts
Diamond emphasizes liberalism as an important consideration that is often missing when people subscribe to the Schumpeterian conception of democracy. He takes Dahl's conception of polyarchy (that we never read about somehow!) and adds in (or explicates) a third dimension of civil liberty. The main point seems to be that by focusing too much on the procedural elements, we neglect the cultural and civil components that are necessary for democracies to be normatively good. I probably agree with this thesis but I still like the Schumpeterian conception for a (possibly illiberal) democracy (not that Diamond would disagree with this). I'm looking forward to digging deeper into the democratic edge cases and illiberal democracies etc.

## Reading Notes

> Defining and Developing Democracy Larry Diamond The basis of a democratic state is liberty. —Aristotle, The Politics Since April of 1974, when the Portuguese mili- tary overthrew the Salazar/Caetano dictatorship, the number of democracies in the world has multiplied dramatically. Before the start of this global trend, there were about forty democracies. The number increased moderately through the late 1970s and early 1980s as several states experienced transitions from authoritarian rule (predominantly military) to democratic rule. In the mid-1980s, the pace of global democratic expansion accelerated markedly. By the end of 1995, there were as many as 117 democracies or as few as 76, depending on how one counts.  ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=0,32,43,43|page 42]])

Between 1974 and 1995 the number of democracies in the world rose from around 40 to about 76 - 117 (depending on how you count)

> The normative perspective underlying this book is that democratization is generally a good thing and that democracy is the best form of government ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=47,6,50,10|page 42]])

The author clearly states the normative perspective of the article. (That democracy is the best form of government).

> However, democracy is not an un- mitigated blessing. Dating back to Aristotle (and to Plato, who had even less sympathy for de- mocracy), the key shapers of democratic political thought have held that the best realizable form of government is mixed, or constitutional, gov- ernment, in which freedom is constrained by the rule of law and popular sovereignty is tempered by state institutions that produce order and sta- bility.3 Aristotle saw that, in a state of pure de- mocracy, ‘‘where the multitude have the supreme power, and supersede the law by their decrees . . . demagogues spring up,’’ and democracy degen- erates into a form of despotism. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=50,12,66,32|page 42]])

> Thus, as Locke, Montesquieu, and the Ameri- can Federalists asserted, only a constitutional government, restraining and dividing the tempo- rary power of the majority, can protect indi- vidual freedom. This fundamental insight (and value) gave birth to a tradition of political thought—liberalism—and to a concept—liberal democracy—that are central to this book ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=69,0,90,39|page 42]])

The origin of "liberal" democracy. 

> I use the term liberal to mean a political system in which individual and group liberties are well protected and in which there exist autonomous spheres of civil society and private life, insulated from state control.  ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=91,18,99,44|page 42]])

Definition of "liberal".

> Up to a point consistent with the principles of constitutionalism and representative democracy, government is better when it is more democratic. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=129,0,131,48|page 42]])

The author claims that the more democratic the better unless it clashes with certain constitutional or representative principles.

> Normatively, I assume here that account- ability of rulers to the ruled and government responsiveness to the diverse interests and preferences of the governed are basic goods. So also are the minimization of violence in political life and of arbitrary action by government. And so, above all, is liberty. Increasingly in the twentieth century, the freedoms of the individual to think, believe, worship, speak, publish, inquire, associate, and become informed, and the freedoms from torture, arbitrary arrest, and unlawful detention—not to mention enslavement and genocide—are recognized as universal and in- alienable human rights. . . . ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=2,0,43,29|page 43]])

The author states a bunch of normative assumptions, particularly emphasizing liberty. 

> Historically, liberty secured through constitutional, limited government and a rule of law—came about before democracy both in England and, in varying degrees, in other European states. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=55,38,65,42|page 43]])

Interesting historical point about liberty preceding democracy. Would the [[Enlightened Absolutism|Enlightened Absolutists]] be included in this? 

> These two facts have rekindled intellectual interest in liberal autocracy as a better, safer, more stable form of government for many transitional societies. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=67,43,91,10|page 43]])

What are examples of liberal autocracies in the present?  [[Singapore]]? Does President of [[El Salvador]] [[Nayib Bukele]] count here? (although perhaps you could argue its more of an illiberal democracy, at least in terms of safety). It seems like there is a trend now of (at least partial) illiberalism. 

> In times of very limited education and political consciousness, when the franchise could be confined to a narrow elite, liberal autocracy was possible. In today’s world, it is an illusion, a his- torical anachronism. Save for two island states with populations of 100,000 each (Tonga; Anti- gua and Barbuda), there are no autocracies in the world that could possibly qualify as liberal. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=94,0,100,45|page 43]])

The author actually claims that liberal autocracy is essentially impossible in the modern era.

> The above positive benefits of democracy de- rive, as Russett notes with respect to interstate peace, from both the norms and the political institutions that characterize democracies ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=44&selection=0,1,3,42|page 44]])

The benefits of democracy come from both the norms it creates as well as the institutions.'

> By and large, most scholarly and policy uses of the term democracy today refer to a purely political conception of the term, and this intellectual shift back to an earlier convention has greatly facilitated progress in studying the dynamics of democracy, including the relationship between political democracy and various social and economic conditions. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=44&selection=59,6,70,31|page 44]])

> The seminal elaboration is Dahl’s conception of polyarchy, which has two overt dimensions: opposition (organized contestation through regular, free, and fair elections) and participation (the right of virtually all adults to vote and contest for office) ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=4,0,12,5|page 45]])

The author calls the Dahl's polyarchy the seminal conception of democracy. It's interesting that the curators of the source book chose to put it last despite so many of the other excerpts referencing it. (I suppose perhaps its because they still believe its the best). 

> Yet embedded in these two dimensions is a third, without which the first two cannot be truly meaningful: civil liberty. Polyarchy encompasses not only freedom to vote and contest for office but also freedom to speak and publish dissenting views, freedom to form and join organizations, and alternative sources of information. Both Dahl’s original formulation and a later, more comprehensive effort to measure polyarchy take seriously the nonelectoral dimensions. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=12,5,25,0|page 45]])

I wonder what Shapiro and Dahl think of this characterization. Is this an "addition" to the theory or an "elaboration". 

> By the minimalist definition, Turkey, India, Sri Lanka, Colombia, and Russia qualify as democracies ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=47&selection=13,0,27,11|page 47]])

I assume Russia would no longer qualify?

> Electoral democracy is a civilian, constitutional system in which the legislative and chief executive offices are filled through regular, competitive, multiparty elections with universal suffrage. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=47&selection=39,0,44,50|page 47]])

Definition of electoral democracy. 

> Liberal democracy. How does liberal democracy extend beyond these formal and intermediate conceptions? In addition to the elements of electoral democracy, it requires, first, the absence of reserved domains of power for the military or other actors not ac- countable to the electorate, directly or indirectly. Second, in addition to the vertical accountability of rulers to the ruled (secured mainly through elections), it requires the horizontal account- ability of officeholders to one another; this constrains executive power and so helps protect constitutionalism, legality, and the deliberative process. Third, it encompasses extensive provisions for political and civic pluralism as well as for individual and group freedoms, so that contending interests and values may be expressed and compete through ongoing processes of articulation and representation, beyond periodic elections. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=47&selection=54,2,95,8|page 47]])

The author outlines conditions necessary for liberal democracy beyond those required for electoral democracy. 

>  For the political quality of democracy, the most important additional mechanism of horizontal accountability is an autonomous judiciary, but crucial as well are institutionalized means (often in a separate, autonomous agency) to monitor, investigate, and punish government corruption at all levels. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=47&selection=153,9,158,40|page 47]])

The author mentions that an autonomous judiciary is an important mechanism for horizontal accountability. 

> Specifically, liberal democracy has the following components:

> Control of the state and its key decisions and allocations lies, in fact as well as in constitutional theory, with elected officials (and not democratically unaccountable actors or foreign powers); in particular, the military is subordinate to the authority of elected civilian officials.

> Executive power is constrained, constitutionally and in fact, by the autonomous power of other government institutions (such as an independent judiciary, parliament, and other mechanisms of horizontal accountability).

> Not only are electoral outcomes uncertain, with a significant opposition vote and the presumption of party alternation in government, but no group that adheres to constitutional principles is denied the right to form a party and contest elections (even if electoral thresholds and other rules exclude small parties from winning representation in parliament).

> Cultural, ethnic, religious, and other minority groups (as well as historically disadvantaged majorities) are not prohibited (legally or in practice) from expressing their interests in the political process or from speaking their language or practicing their culture.

> Beyond parties and elections, citizens have multiple, ongoing channels for expression and representation of their interests and values, including diverse, independent associations and movements, which they have the freedom to form and join.

> There are alternative sources of information (including independent media) to which citizens have (politically) unfettered access.

> Individuals also have substantial freedom of belief, opinion, discussion, speech, publication, assembly, demonstration, and petition.

> Citizens are politically equal under the law (even though they are invariably unequal in their political resources).

> Individual and group liberties are effectively protected by an independent, nondiscriminatory judiciary, whose decisions are enforced and respected by other centers of power.

> The rule of law protects citizens from unjustified detention, exile, terror, torture, and undue interference in their personal lives not only by the state but also by organized nonstate or anti-state forces. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=48&selection=43,0,44,15|page 48]])

The author outlines ten conditions of liberal democracy,

> These ten conditions imply an eleventh: if political authority is to be constrained and balanced, individual and minority rights protected, and a rule of law assured, democracy requires a constitution that is supreme. Liberal democracies in particular ‘‘are and have to be constitutional democracies. The lack of a constitutional spirit, of an understanding of the centrality of constitutional stability, is one of the weaknesses’’ of many illiberal third-wave democracies in the postcommunist world, as well as in the Third World. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=49&selection=2,0,36,0|page 49]])

Strong claim. I wonder if this is central to where Shapiro and Dahl disagree (although again I am assuming they disagree). I recall Shapiro stating that there does not seem to be evidence that there is correlation between protection of rights and judicial review/constitutionalism. This will likely be covered in the democracy and constitutionalism section. 

> The question of how extensive liberty must be before a political system can be termed a liberal democracy is a normative and philosophical one. The key distinction is whether the political process centers on elections or whether it encompasses a much broader and more continuous play of interest articulation, representation, and contestation. If we view the latter as an essential component of democracy, then there must be adequate freedoms surrounding that broader process as well, and to use O’Donnell’s language, individuals must be able to exercise their rights of citizenship not only in elections but also in obtaining ‘‘fair access to public agencies and courts,’’ which is often denied in ‘‘informally institutionalized’’ polyarchies. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=49&selection=105,0,122,7|page 49]])

> The distinction between political and civil freedom, on the one hand, and cultural freedom (or license), on the other, is often confused in the debate over whether democracy is inappropriate for Asia (or East Asia, or Confucian Asia, or simply Singapore) because of incompatible values. Liberal democracy does not require the comprehensively exalted status of individual rights that obtains in Western Europe and especially the United States. Thus, one may accept many of the cultural objections of advocates of the ‘‘Asian values’’ perspective (that Western democracies have shifted the balance too much in favor of individual rights and social entitlements over the rights of the community and the social obligations of the individual to the community) and still embrace the political and civic fundamentals of liberal democracy as articulated above. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=49&selection=129,0,177,6|page 49]])

>  One can have a political system that meets the ten criteria of liberal democracy I outline but that is culturally conservative or restrictive in some policies. The key test is whether those who disagree with these policies have full civic and political freedom to mobilize to change them. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=49&selection=225,14,230,27|page 49]])

Interesting point about Asia. Perhaps worth reading more. 

> Beyond this, increasing citizen competence and participation in the political process will spill over into other arenas of social life. Civic engagement, such as participation in voluntary associations and community networks, generates trust, reciprocity, and cooperation, which reduce cynicism, encourage political participation, and facilitate economic development, democratic stability, and the resolution of social problems.  ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=52&selection=3,0,21,1|page 52]])

As discussed in the previous excerpts the extent to which this can be done (and lead to positive consequences rather than negative ones) is an interesting one. Is there a cap on political participation and competence of citizens? To what extent through education and deliberation can we come to agreements in society? 
## Questions and Comments

> Liberal democracy provides, by definition, comparatively good protection for human rights.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=44,0,53,47|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

This of course requires agreement on the human rights in question. Marxists/leftists may not feel that liberal democracy does a good job of protecting what they perceive as human rights. 

> Fareed Zakaria, ‘‘The Rise of Illiberal Democracy,’’ Foreign Affairs 76, no. 6 (1997)

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=151,4,156,16|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

We should read this! 

> And there will not be any significant ones in the future, for liberalism insists upon the sovereignty of the people to decide their form of government—and these days, according to Marc Plattner, ‘‘popular sovereignty can hardly fail to lead to popular government.’’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=104,0,109,32|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

> Marc F. Plattner, ‘‘Liberalism and Democracy,’’ Foreign Affairs

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=180,4,183,0|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

We should also read this!

>  The only way the demand for meaningful political participation and choice can be suppressed is to constrain liberty.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=125,10,127,35|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

What about economic prosperity as in the case of China? What about false consciousness as argued by leftists? (I suppose perhaps you could see this as a constraint on liberty but probably a different definition of liberty than Larry Diamond has in mind)

> In fact, Przeworski et al. report that the Freedom House combined ratings for 1972 to 1990 predict 93 percent of their regime classifications during this period (‘‘What Makes Democracies Endure?’’ 52). However, as we see in chapter 2, since 1990 the formal properties and the liberal substance of democracy have increasingly diverged. Thus, the substantive validity of measures that focus mainly on formal competition may be particularly suspect after 1990.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=46&selection=104,3,112,35|democracy-sourcebook, page 46]]

This is pretty interesting.

## Overall Thoughts

Firstly, one difference in framing I wanted to point about between Schumpeter/Przeworksi's minimalists conception and Diamond's substantive conception is that in the minimalist conception they seem to identify a minimal definition with good properties and then argue that its good (worth protecting) whereas Diamond seems to start from the normative claim that "democracy is good" and then find the definition which "captures" what that means. 

Secondly, Diamond's conditions for democracy do not include all desirable properties of society (as in Rousseau) but only those he deems necessary to achieve a certainly level of "democraticness" throughout society. 

I think I mainly agree with the things he says although I didn't feel it was particularly insightful and the stronger points that may have been insightful may not hold up to empirical evidence (for example about constitutionalism)
