## Reading Notes

> Defining and Developing Democracy Larry Diamond The basis of a democratic state is liberty. —Aristotle, The Politics Since April of 1974, when the Portuguese mili- tary overthrew the Salazar/Caetano dictatorship, the number of democracies in the world has multiplied dramatically. Before the start of this global trend, there were about forty democracies. The number increased moderately through the late 1970s and early 1980s as several states experienced transitions from authoritarian rule (predominantly military) to democratic rule. In the mid-1980s, the pace of global democratic expansion accelerated markedly. By the end of 1995, there were as many as 117 democracies or as few as 76, depending on how one counts. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=0,32,43,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 42]]

Between 1974 and 1995 the number of democracies in the world rose from around 40 to about 76 - 117 (depending on how you count)

> The normative perspective underlying this book is that democratization is generally a good thing and that democracy is the best form of government

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=47,6,50,10|democracy-sourcebook, page 42]]

The author clearly states the normative perspective of the article. (That democracy is the best form of government).

> However, democracy is not an un- mitigated blessing. Dating back to Aristotle (and to Plato, who had even less sympathy for de- mocracy), the key shapers of democratic political thought have held that the best realizable form of government is mixed, or constitutional, gov- ernment, in which freedom is constrained by the rule of law and popular sovereignty is tempered by state institutions that produce order and sta- bility.3 Aristotle saw that, in a state of pure de- mocracy, ‘‘where the multitude have the supreme power, and supersede the law by their decrees . . . demagogues spring up,’’ and democracy degen- erates into a form of despotism.

> Thus, as Locke, Montesquieu, and the Ameri- can Federalists asserted, only a constitutional government, restraining and dividing the tempo- rary power of the majority, can protect indi- vidual freedom. This fundamental insight (and value) gave birth to a tradition of political thought—liberalism—and to a concept—liberal democracy—that are central to this book

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=69,0,90,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 42]]

The origin of "liberal" democracy. 

> I use the term liberal to mean a political system in which individual and group liberties are well protected and in which there exist autonomous spheres of civil society and private life, insulated from state control. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=91,18,99,44|democracy-sourcebook, page 42]]

Definition of "liberal".

> Up to a point consistent with the principles of constitutionalism and representative democracy, government is better when it is more democratic.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=42&selection=129,0,131,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 42]]

The author claims that the more democratic the better unless it clashes with certain constitutional or representative principles.

> Normatively, I assume here that account- ability of rulers to the ruled and government responsiveness to the diverse interests and preferences of the governed are basic goods. So also are the minimization of violence in political life and of arbitrary action by government. And so, above all, is liberty. Increasingly in the twentieth century, the freedoms of the individual to think, believe, worship, speak, publish, inquire, associate, and become informed, and the freedoms from torture, arbitrary arrest, and unlawful detention—not to mention enslavement and genocide—are recognized as universal and in- alienable human rights. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=2,0,43,29|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

The author states a bunch of normative assumptions, particularly emphasizing liberty. 

> Historically, liberty secured through constitutional, limited government and a rule of law—came about before democracy both in England and, in varying degrees, in other European states.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=55,38,65,42|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

Interesting historical point about liberty preceding democracy. Would the [[Enlightened Absolutism|Enlightened Absolutists]] be included in this? 

> These two facts have rekindled intellectual interest in liberal autocracy as a better, safer, more stable form of government for many transitional societies.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=67,43,91,10|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

What are examples of liberal autocracies in the present?  Singapore? Does President of El Salvador [[Nayib Bukele]] count here? (although perhaps you could argue its more of an illiberal democracy, at least in terms of safety). It seems like there is a trend now of (at least partial) illiberalism. 

> In times of very limited education and political consciousness, when the franchise could be confined to a narrow elite, liberal autocracy was possible. In today’s world, it is an illusion, a his- torical anachronism. Save for two island states with populations of 100,000 each (Tonga; Anti- gua and Barbuda), there are no autocracies in the world that could possibly qualify as liberal.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=94,0,100,45|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

The author actually claims that liberal autocracy is essentially impossible in the modern era.

> The above positive benefits of democracy de- rive, as Russett notes with respect to interstate peace, from both the norms and the political institutions that characterize democracies

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=44&selection=0,1,3,42|democracy-sourcebook, page 44]]

The benefits of democracy come from both the norms it creates as well as the institutions.'

> By and large, most scholarly and policy uses of the term democracy today refer to a purely political conception of the term, and this intellectual shift back to an earlier convention has greatly facilitated progress in studying the dynamics of democracy, including the relationship between political democracy and various social and economic conditions.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=44&selection=59,6,70,31|democracy-sourcebook, page 44]]

> The seminal elaboration is Dahl’s conception of polyarchy, which has two overt dimensions: opposition (organized contestation through regular, free, and fair elections) and participation (the right of virtually all adults to vote and contest for office)

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=4,0,12,5|democracy-sourcebook, page 45]]

The author calls the Dahl's polyarchy the seminal conception of democracy. It's interesting that the curators of the source book chose to put it last despite so many of the other excerpts referencing it. (I suppose perhaps its because they still believe its the best). 

> Yet embedded in these two dimensions is a third, without which the first two cannot be truly meaningful: civil liberty. Polyarchy encompasses not only freedom to vote and contest for office but also freedom to speak and publish dissenting views, freedom to form and join organizations, and alternative sources of information. Both Dahl’s original formulation and a later, more comprehensive effort to measure polyarchy take seriously the nonelectoral dimensions.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=45&selection=12,5,25,0|democracy-sourcebook, page 45]]

I wonder what Shapiro and Dahl think of this characterization. Is this an "addition" to the theory or an "elaboration". 
## Questions and Comments

> Liberal democracy provides, by definition, comparatively good protection for human rights.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=44,0,53,47|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

This of course requires agreement on the human rights in question. Marxists/leftists may not feel that liberal democracy does a good job of protecting what they perceive as human rights.

We should read this! 

> And there will not be any significant ones in the future, for liberalism insists upon the sovereignty of the people to decide their form of government—and these days, according to Marc Plattner, ‘‘popular sovereignty can hardly fail to lead to popular government.’’

>  The only way the demand for meaningful political participation and choice can be suppressed is to constrain liberty.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=43&selection=125,10,127,35|democracy-sourcebook, page 43]]

What about economic prosperity as in the case of China? What about false consciousness as argued by leftists? (I suppose perhaps you could see this as a constraint on liberty but probably a different definition of liberty than Larry Diamond has in mind)
