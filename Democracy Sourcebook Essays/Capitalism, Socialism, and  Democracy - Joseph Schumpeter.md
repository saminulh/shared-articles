### Notes

> It is held, then, \[by eighteenth century philosophers\] that there exists a Common Good, the obvious beacon light of policy, which is always simple to define and which every normal person can be made to see by means of rational argument.

> It is true that the management of some of these affairs requires special aptitudes and techniques and will therefore have to be entrusted to specialists who have them

> \[Fundamental differences in common goods\] will introduce rifts on questions of principle which cannot be rec- onciled by rational argument because ultimate values—our conceptions of what life and what society should be—are beyond the range of mere logic.

> the result \[of the democratic process\] lacks not only rational unity but also rational sanction

> even if the opinions and desires of individual citizens were perfectly definite and independent data for the democratic process to work with, and if everyone acted on them with ideal rationality and promptitude, it would not necessarily follow that the political decisions produced by that process from the raw material of those individual volitions would represent anything that could in any convincing sense be called the will of the people

> we now take the view that the role of the people is to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in turn will produce a national executive or government.

### Questions and Comments

Re [[#^bcb3ae|quote]]: I wonder what caused them to believe this? Was it just the Enlightenment hype or does it also have to do with the homogeneity/lack of diversity among the intelligentsia at the time?

> possibly with a general secretary or scapegoat at its head, a so-called prime minister.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=18&selection=124,12,140,9|democracy-sourcebook, page 18]]

Scapegoat lol

> As soon as we accept all the assumptions that are being made by this theory of the polity— or implied by it—democracy indeed acquires a perfectly unambiguous meaning and there is no problem in connection with it except how to bring it about.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=19&selection=0,0,15,15|democracy-sourcebook, page 19]]

Interesting point, so it all becomes cast as “means” problem rather than an “ends” problem.

> It should be noted in passing that democratic phraseology has been instrumental in fostering the association of inequality of any kind with ‘‘injustice’’ which is so important an element in the psychic pattern of the unsuccessful and in the arsenal of the politician who uses him

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=21&selection=115,0,120,8|democracy-sourcebook, page 21]]

Interesting. I think Shapiro has brought this up?

> The chances for this \[fair compromise\] to happen are greatest with those issues which are quantitative in nature

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=21&selection=60,30,64,31|democracy-sourcebook, page 21]]

The distinction being between quantitative vs. qualitative / admitting gradation vs. not is interesting and I’m not sure exactly how true that is, I would have said morally loaded vs. not. E.g., the timeline for when you can abort a fetus is slide-able and for some people, settling on a threshold can constitute a “fair compromise,” but for certain constituencies, any such compromise is bad.

> The argument against proportional representation has been ably stated by Professor F. A. Hermens in ‘‘The Trojan Horse of Democracy,’’ Social Research, November 1938

Seems interesting to look into.
### Final Thoughts

Elegant re-characterization of democracy, especially in light of [[The Social Contract - Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Interestingly, this conception, in my view, re-introduces coherence of the “popular will”. Whereas in the classical conception the popular will was directed toward nebulous policies and goals, this conception directs the popular to a fixed set of choices (i.e., the candidates) and thereby makes the will a more resolute concept (this reading implies that this will is strongest in a two-party system, where there can be clear winners and losers).

The eviction idea is also pretty interesting, being the mechanism that ensures parties stick to the agendas that got them into office. Do term limits in themselves constitute eviction (or rather, the possibility of it), or should eviction have a more immediate connotation, such as a vote of no-confidence/recall vote? If end-of-term re-elections, then they ought to be short enough that the people don’t forget any deviation at the beginning of the term (do US presidents have a strong enough fear of eviction to enact their platform? also do presidents in their second term legislate less than in their first?).
