### Notes

> It is held, then, \[by eighteenth century philosophers\] that there exists a Common Good, the obvious beacon light of policy, which is always simple to define and which every normal person can be made to see by means of rational argument.

> It is true that the management of some of these affairs requires special aptitudes and techniques and will therefore have to be entrusted to specialists who have them

> \[Fundamental differences in common goods\] will introduce rifts on questions of principle which cannot be rec- onciled by rational argument because ultimate values—our conceptions of what life and what society should be—are beyond the range of mere logic.

### Questions and Comments

Re [[#^bcb3ae|quote]]: I wonder what caused them to believe this? Was it just the Enlightenment hype or does it also have to do with the homogeneity/lack of diversity among the intelligentsia at the time?

> possibly with a general secretary or scapegoat at its head, a so-called prime minister.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=18&selection=124,12,140,9|democracy-sourcebook, page 18]]

Scapegoat lol

> As soon as we accept all the assumptions that are being made by this theory of the polity— or implied by it—democracy indeed acquires a perfectly unambiguous meaning and there is no problem in connection with it except how to bring it about.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=19&selection=0,0,15,15|democracy-sourcebook, page 19]]

Interesting point, so it all becomes cast as “means” problem rather than an “ends” problem.

> It should be noted in passing that democratic phraseology has been instrumental in fostering the association of inequality of any kind with ‘‘injustice’’ which is so important an element in the psychic pattern of the unsuccessful and in the arsenal of the politician who uses him

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=21&selection=115,0,120,8|democracy-sourcebook, page 21]]

Interesting. I think Shapiro has brought this up?

> The chances for this \[fair compromise\] to happen are greatest with those issues which are quantitative in nature

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=21&selection=60,30,64,31|democracy-sourcebook, page 21]]

The distinction being between quantitative vs. qualitative / admitting gradation vs. not is interesting and I’m not sure exactly how true that is, I would have said morally loaded vs. not. E.g., the timeline for when you can abort a fetus is slide-able and for some people, settling on a threshold can constitute a “fair compromise,” but for certain constituencies, any such compromise is bad.

> The argument against proportional representation has been ably stated by Professor F. A. Hermens in ‘‘The Trojan Horse of Democracy,’’ Social Research, November 1938

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=24&selection=122,3,128,13|democracy-sourcebook, page 24]]

Seems interesting to look into.
### Final Thoughts

Elegant re-characterization of democracy, especially in light of [[The Social Contract - Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Interestingly, this conception, in my view, re-introduces coherence of the “popular will”. Whereas in the classical conception the popular will was directed toward nebulous policies and goals, this conception directs the popular to a fixed set of choices (i.e., the candidates) and thereby makes the will a more resolute concept (this reading implies that this will is strongest in a two-party system, where there can be clear winners and losers).

The eviction idea is also pretty interesting, being the mechanism that ensures parties stick to the agendas that got them into office. Do term limits in themselves constitute eviction (or rather, the possibility of it), or should eviction have a more immediate connotation, such as a vote of no-confidence/recall vote? If end-of-term re-elections, then they ought to be short enough that the people don’t forget any deviation at the beginning of the term (do US presidents have a strong enough fear of eviction to enact their platform? also do presidents in their second term legislate less than in their first?).

> The eighteenth-century philosophy of democracy may be couched in the following definition: the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions which realizes the common good by making the people itself decide issues through the election of individuals who are to assemble in order to carry out its will.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=18&selection=8,0,15,50|democracy-sourcebook, page 18]]

Schumpeter's description of the eighteenth-century conception of democracy. I would say that the overall idea presented here is still part of the mythos of democracy present today (especially among the left). 

> Moreover, this common good implies definite answers to all questions so that every social fact and every measure taken or to be taken can unequivocally be classed as ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘bad.’’ All people having therefore to agree, in principle at least, there is also a Common Will of the people (= will of all reasonable individuals) that is exactly coterminous with the common good or interest or welfare or happiness

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=18&selection=46,26,68,6|democracy-sourcebook, page 18]]

 Schumpeter describes the implications of this conception of democracy to the existence of a common will of the people (which can perhaps be derived). In the framing of Ian Shapiro's course on the [[Moral Foundations of Politics Course Readings|Moral Foundations of Philosophy]], this paints this conception of democracy as part of the enlightenment project to turn "politics into administration" using scientific principles.

> There is, first, no such thing as a uniquely determined common good that all people could agree on or be made to agree on by the force of rational argument. This is due not primarily to the fact that some people may want things other than the common good but to the much more fundamental fact that to different individuals and groups the common good is bound to mean different things. This fact, hidden from the utilitarian by the narrowness of his outlook on the world of human valuations, will introduce rifts on questions of principle which cannot be reconciled by rational argument because ultimate values—our conceptions of what life and what society should be—are beyond the range of mere logic

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=19&selection=51,0,76,5|democracy-sourcebook, page 19]]

Schumpeter's rejection of "the common good".

>  We have every reason to be on our guard against the pitfalls that lie on the path of those defenders of democracy who while accepting, under pressure of accumulating evidence, more and more of the facts of the democratic process, yet try to anoint the results that process turns out with oil taken from eighteenth-century jars.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=20&selection=44,10,51,5|democracy-sourcebook, page 20]]

Schumpeter suggests that while much of the successes of democracy does not come from "the common good" point of view, proponents of that view try to frame it as such. 

> The latter means, since that will is no longer congruent with any ‘‘good,’’ that in order to claim ethical dignity for the result it will now be necessary to fall back upon an unqualified confidence in democratic forms of government as such—a belief that in principle would have to be independent of the desirability of results

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=20&selection=98,16,109,7|democracy-sourcebook, page 20]]

Schumpeter explaining the consequences of dropping the "common good" on the legitimacy of democratic government. 

> It should be noted in passing that democratic phraseology has been instrumental in fostering the association of inequality of any kind with ‘‘injustice’’ which is so important an element in the psychic pattern of the unsuccessful and in the arsenal of the politician who uses him. One of the most curious symptoms of this was the Athenian institution of ostracism or rather the use to which it was sometimes put. Ostracism consisted in banishing an individual by popular vote, not necessarily for any particular reason: it sometimes served as a method of eliminating an uncomfortably prominent citizen who was felt to ‘‘count for more than one.’’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=21&selection=115,0,126,52|democracy-sourcebook, page 21]]

Interesting note about the association between inequality and injustice. 

> But with qualitative issues, such as the question whether to persecute heretics or to enter upon a war, the result attained may well, though for different reasons, be equally distasteful to all the people whereas the decision imposed by a non- democratic agency might prove much more acceptable to them. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=21&selection=68,0,74,23|democracy-sourcebook, page 21]]

Schumpeter gives examples where "compromise" may not be an option.

> Suppose we reverse the roles of these two elements and make the deciding of issues by the electorate secondary to the election of the men who are to do the deciding. To put it differently, we now take the view that the role of the people is to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in turn will produce a national executive or government. And we define: the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=22&selection=25,45,54,47|democracy-sourcebook, page 22]]

Schumpeter's framing of democracy: rather than the focus being on "the people" making decisions through representatives, the focus should be on "the people" choosing representatives \[through a competitive struggle\] who make decisions. 

> Second, the theory embodied in this definition leaves all the room we may wish to have for a proper recognition of the vital fact of leadership. The classical theory did not do this but, as we have seen, attributed to the electorate an altogether unrealistic degree of initiative which practically amounted to ignoring leadership. But collectives act almost exclusively by accepting leadership—this is the dominant mechanism of practically any collective action which is more than a reflex.

^d23962

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=22&selection=166,0,170,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 22]]

Schumpeter points out that a good theory of democracy needs to take into account the role of leadership in collective action. (I think this is a good and interesting point)

>  Such volitions do not as a rule assert themselves directly. Even if strong and definite they remain latent, often for decades, until they are called to life by some political leader who turns them into political factors. This he does, or else his agents do it for him, by organizing these volitions, by working them up and by including eventually appropriate items in his competitive offering. The interaction between sectional interests and public opinion and the way in which they produce the pattern we call the political situation appear from this angle in a new and much clearer light.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=23&selection=39,24,51,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 23]]

In the next paragraph I think perhaps he overemphasizes leadership. However if you view this not as a single leader, but a group of leaders (like the "Bolsheviks" for example) perhaps its still fair. 

> Fourth, our theory is of course no more definite than is the concept of competition for leadership. This concept presents similar difficulties as the concept of competition in the economic sphere, with which it may be usefully compared

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=23&selection=52,0,56,46|democracy-sourcebook, page 23]]

Schumpeter suggests that politics can be seen as a competition for leadership, sharing similarities with the competition between firms in economics. 

> To simplify matters we have restricted the kind of competition for leadership which is to define democracy, to free competition for a free vote. The justification for this is that democracy seems to imply a recognized method by which to conduct the competi- tive struggle, and that the electoral method is practically the only one available for commu- nities of any size

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=23&selection=61,30,69,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 23]]

While I don't think this is the focus of this excerpt, this seems clearly unsatisfactory. 

> But though this excludes many ways of securing leadership which should be excluded,4 such as competition by military insurrection, it does not exclude the cases that are strikingly analogous to the economic phenomena we label ‘‘unfair’’ or ‘‘fraudulent’’ competition or restraint of competition. And we cannot exclude them because if we did we should be left with a completely unrealistic ideal.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=23&selection=69,20,92,36|democracy-sourcebook, page 23]]

What cases is he talking about? "Tyranny of the majority" type situations?

> The one means simply the acceptance of a leader or a group of leaders, the other means simply the withdrawal of this acceptance. This takes care of an element the reader may have missed. He may have thought that the electorate controls as well as installs. But since electorates normally do not control their political leaders in any way except by refusing to reelect them or the parliamentary majorities that support them, it seems well to re- duce our ideas about this control in the way indicated by our definition. Occasionally, spontaneous revulsions occur which upset a government or an individual minister directly or else enforce a certain course of action. But they are not only exceptional, they are, as we shall see, contrary to the spirit of the democratic method.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=24&selection=34,34,64,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 24]]

Schumpeter emphasizes that for the most part "the people" do not control the leadership, and their main way to interact with the current leadership is to evict them (or in their threat to evict them). 

> But before concluding that democracy becomes unworkable if its principle is carried out consistently, it is just as well to ask ourselves whether this principle really implies proportional representation. As a matter of fact it does not. If acceptance of leadership is the true function of the electorate’s vote, the case for proportional representation col- lapses because its premises are no longer binding.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=24&selection=103,0,111,50|democracy-sourcebook, page 24]]

Schumpeter points out that proportional representation tries to capture the eighteenth century ideal of democracy (This was a great point!)
### Additional Questions and Comments

> The former means that, though from the standpoint of analysis, the democratic process is not simply chaotic— for the analyst nothing is chaotic that can be brought within the reach of explanatory principles—yet the results would not, except by chance, be meaningful in themselves—as for instance the realization of any definite end or ideal would be.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=20&selection=68,29,98,15|democracy-sourcebook, page 20]]

What does he mean by this? 

> I think that most students of politics have by now come to accept the criticisms leveled at the classical doctrine of democracy in the preceding chapter

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=22&selection=5,0,8,7|democracy-sourcebook, page 22]]

This makes me curious how does the average political science student (at say UofT) view the role of democracy? (Perhaps look at the political science curriculum).

> It will be remembered that our chief troubles about the classical theory centered in the proposition that ‘‘the people’’ hold a definite and rational opinion about every individual question and that they give effect to this opinion—in a democracy—by choosing ‘‘representatives’’ who will see to it that that opinion is carried out. Thus the selection of the representatives is made secondary to the primary purpose of the democratic arrangement which is to vest the power of deciding political issues in the electorate

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=22&selection=15,0,25,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 22]]

Its been a while, but I get the sense that this was roughly the view that was imposed upon me (and others) in high school. 

> quasi per inspirationem

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=23&selection=132,1,133,23|democracy-sourcebook, page 23]]

couldn't even find a definition for this one... 

> But there is still a relation between the two. If, on principle at least, everyone is free to compete for political leadership6 by presenting himself to the electorate, this will in most cases though not in all mean a considerable amount of freedom of discussion for all. In particular it will normally mean a considerable amount of free- dom of the press. This relation between democ- racy and freedom is not absolutely stringent and can be tampered with. But, from the standpoint of the intellectual, it is nevertheless very impor- tant. At the same time, it is all there is to that relation.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=24&selection=11,7,29,9|democracy-sourcebook, page 24]]

The point about individual freedom seems a bit "half-baked"

> Free, that is, in the same sense in which everyone is free to start another textile mill.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=24&selection=120,3,121,35|democracy-sourcebook, page 24]]

This was funny

### Overall Thoughts

Schumpeter presents a conception of democracy where the primary role of "the people" is to choose leadership in competitive elections. I agree with most of the article (and especially the critiques of the eighteenth century conception of democracy which I believe is still popular today). I think many of the ideas proposed in the article I had essentially already accepted (from reading/listening to Shapiro and Przeworski) but I really liked Schumpeter's writing and presentation. Two ideas which stood out to me that I had not thought of before was the "central role of leadership in collective action" and the "proportional representation as attempt to realize the common will".
