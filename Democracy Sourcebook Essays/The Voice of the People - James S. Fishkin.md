## Notes
> Take a national random sample of the electorate and transport those people from all over the country to a single place ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=38&selection=24,20,39,5|page 38]])

> A deliberative poll takes the two technologies, polling and television ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=38&selection=76,0,77,21|page 38]])

Interesting how much television features for him.

> We gathered the national random sam- ple for the first deliberative poll, April 15–17, 1994, at the Granada Television Studio in Man- chester, England. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=38&selection=86,6,89,17|page 38]])

Would be interesting to see more about this. I'm not sure why the excerpt glossed over it.

> The second model, instead of absorbing its agenda from the experts, energizes a public voice coming *from* the citizens so that it can speak *to* the elites. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=40&selection=2,20,13,12|page 40]])

This is a cool aspiration.

> The logic is very simple. If we take a micro- cosm of the entire country and subject it to a certain experience, and if the microcosm (behav- ing in the way we would like ideal citizens to behave in seriously deliberating about the issues) then comes to di¤erent conclusions about those issues, our inference is simply that if, somehow, the entire country were subjected to the same experience as the microcosm, then hypothetically the entire country would also come to similar conclusions ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=40&selection=17,0,27,11|page 40]])

I'm really curious how this logic really scales. How much should we expect the post-deliberative state of one person to transfer to another? I also generally wonder how large the deliberative group has to be to get a truly representative sample? For example, to get trans representation, the sample would have to be in the order of hundreds--how do large samples affect the deliberative process?
## Final Thoughts
This is a cool idea and some version of this would be kind of cool, especially if it had social clout. Fishkin says that this has prescriptive power owing to its representative nature, but I'm suspicious it would in practice--I'm not sure someone would be convinced to change their minds simply on the basis that someone like them in the deliberative process did (they may alternately believe that the deliberation was biased or corrupted in some way). Furthermore, in highly polarized politics, this sort of deliberation may fail completely (I can imagine that even if one may otherwise change their minds, the fact that their social circles is so heavily politicized means that they may not want to publicly admit "defeat").

## Reading Notes

> Ordinary polls model what the public is thinking, even though the public may not be thinking very much or paying much attention. A deliberative poll attempts to model what the public would think, had it a better opportunity to consider the questions at issue.

The difference between ordinary polls and deliberative polls 

> The idea is simple. Take a national random sample of the electorate and transport those people from all over the country to a single place. Immerse the sample in the issues, with carefully balanced briefing materials, with intensive discussions in small groups, and with the chance to question competing experts and politicians. At the end of several days of working through the issues face to face, poll the participants in detail. The resulting survey o¤ers a representation of the considered judgments of the public—the views the entire country would come to if it had the same experience of behaving more like ideal citizens immersed in the issues for an extended period

The idea of the deliberative poll

> A deliberative poll is not meant to describe or predict public opinion. Rather it prescribes

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=38&selection=65,0,66,44|democracy-sourcebook, page 38]]

A deliberative poll is prescriptive rather than predictive or descriptive. 

> Such a flourishing of a new institution is clearly utopian, even as a matter of aspiration. But the image helps clarify an ideal—a picture of the reconstructed role of citizen, not just on television but in actual life. At a minimum, the deliberative poll can articulate the considered judgments of an informed citizenry and broad- cast those conclusions to the nation. It provides a different, and more thoughtful, public voice. Other innovations and other institutions would have to be relied on if we are to create a seriously engaged mass citizenry as a routine part of our national life. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=41&selection=3,10,15,20|democracy-sourcebook, page 41]]

The idea that deliberative polls can galvanize the citizenry to be active participants in democracy is utopian yet clarifies an ideal

## Overall Thoughts

One major issue with this experiment is that it puts no weighting on interests. If dis-consensus is fundamental (and to some extent I believe it is) then politics (strategical deals or concessions) may be just as important as deliberation, which this article does not address. I do however think it is an interesting experiment, while I may not agree that it is prescriptive to the nation as a whole (critiques from [[Capitalism, Socialism, and  Democracy - Joseph Schumpeter]]   about "common will/good" apply) it could be useful for individuals to better determine their own interests (although it seems the proposal of the 1995 book this is excerpted from never caught on)
