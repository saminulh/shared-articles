## Reading Notes

> Ordinary polls model what the public is thinking, even though the public may not be thinking very much or paying much attention. A deliberative poll attempts to model what the public would think, had it a better opportunity to consider the questions at issue.

The difference between ordinary polls and deliberative polls 

> The idea is simple. Take a national random sample of the electorate and transport those people from all over the country to a single place. Immerse the sample in the issues, with carefully balanced briefing materials, with intensive discussions in small groups, and with the chance to question competing experts and politicians. At the end of several days of working through the issues face to face, poll the participants in detail. The resulting survey o¤ers a representation of the considered judgments of the public—the views the entire country would come to if it had the same experience of behaving more like ideal citizens immersed in the issues for an extended period

The idea of the deliberative poll

> A deliberative poll is not meant to describe or predict public opinion. Rather it prescribes

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=38&selection=65,0,66,44|democracy-sourcebook, page 38]]

A deliberative poll is prescriptive rather than predictive or descriptive. 

> Such a flourishing of a new institution is clearly utopian, even as a matter of aspiration. But the image helps clarify an ideal—a picture of the reconstructed role of citizen, not just on television but in actual life. At a minimum, the deliberative poll can articulate the considered judgments of an informed citizenry and broad- cast those conclusions to the nation. It provides a different, and more thoughtful, public voice. Other innovations and other institutions would have to be relied on if we are to create a seriously engaged mass citizenry as a routine part of our national life. . . .

The idea that deliberative polls can galvanize the citizenry to be active participants in democracy is utopian yet clarifies an ideal

## Overall Thoughts

One major issue with this experiment is that it puts no weighting on interests. If dis-consensus is fundamental (and to some extent I believe it is) then politics (strategical deals or concessions) may be just as important as deliberation, which this article does not address. I do however think it is an interesting experiment, while I may not agree that it is prescriptive to the nation as a whole (critiques from [[Capitalism, Socialism, and  Democracy - Joseph Schumpeter]]   about "common will/good" apply) it could be useful for individuals to better determine their own interests (although it seems the proposal of the 1995 book this is excerpted from never caught on)
