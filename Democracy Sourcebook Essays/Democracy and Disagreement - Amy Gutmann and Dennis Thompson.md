### Reading Notes 

> We address the challenge of moral disagreement here by developing a conception of democracy that secures a central place for moral discussion in political life.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=29,32,32,53|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The goal of the article as stated in the introduction. 

> Along with a growing number of other political theorists, we call this conception deliberative democracy. The core idea is simple: when citizens or their representatives disagree morally, they should continue to reason together to reach mutually acceptable decisions.

A summary of the core idea behind deliberative democracy. 

> The aim of the moral reasoning that our deliberative democracy prescribes falls between impartiality, which requires something like altruism, and prudence, which demands no more than enlightened self-interest

A summary of the moral reasoning prescribed by their version of deliberative democracy. 

> Its first principle is reciprocity. . . . When citizens reason reciprocally, they seek fair terms of social cooperation for their own sake; they try to find mutually acceptable ways of resolving moral disagreements. The precise content of reciprocity is difficult to determine in theory, but its general countenance is familiar enough in practice. It can be seen in the difference between acting in one’s self-interest (say, taking advantage of a legal loophole or a lucky break) and acting fairly (following rules in the spirit that one expects others to adopt). 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=93,32,107,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The authors describe reciprocity, the first principle of the moral reasoning behind deliberative democracy (which contains elements of altruism and prudence). 

> Even though the quality of deliberation and the conditions under which it is conducted are far from ideal in the controversies we consider, the fact that in each case some citizens and some officials make arguments consistent with reciprocity suggests that a deliberative perspective is not utopian.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=112,7,118,20|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The authors claim that officials do make arguments in the real world consistent with reciprocity and therefore the deliberative perspective is not utopian.  

>  Having good reason as individuals to believe that a policy is just does not mean that collectively as citizens we have sufficient justification to legislate on the basis of those reasons. The moral authority of collective judgements about policy depends in part on the moral quality of the process by which citizens collectively reach those judgements. Deliberation is the most appropriate way for citizens collectively to resolve their moral disagreements not only about policies but also about the process by which policies should be adopted. Deliberation is not only a means to an end, but also a means for deciding what means are morally required to pursue our common ends. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=16,13,40,29|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

The authors argue that democracy itself provides the moral justification for legislature. 

> In the standard theories of democracy —proceduralism and constitutionalism—deliberation likewise receives little attention. These theories are surprisingly silent about the need for ongoing discussion of moral disagreement in everyday political life. As a result, we suffer from a deliberative deficit not only in our democratic politics but also in our democratic theory. We are unlikely to lower the deficit in our politics if we do not also reduce it in our theory.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=57,13,70,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

The authors critique procedural democracy for not addressing the need for deliberation on moral disagreement. Furthermore they suggest that such an oversight has real world consequences. Perhaps a counter argument to this would be the "crossfire" line of reasoning from the Shapiro lectures and MacIntyre. It seems to me that we often do try to deliberate as some sort of facade, but the underlying disagreements are too great to be overcome by a much higher level discussion. Yet perhaps the authors would argue that they are not arguing with deliberative principles (reciprocity for example). 

> The conception of deliberative democracy that we defend here seeks to diminish that deficit in theory and in politics. The conception consists of three principles—reciprocity, publicity, and accountability—that regulate the process of politics, and three others—basic liberty, basic opportunity, and fair opportunity—that govern the content of policies.

The six main principles of deliberative democracy. Three that regulate the process of politics and three the govern the content of policies. 

### Additional Questions and Comments

> Sometimes the assumptions are obviously true: only women bear children.

This is funny given the current cultural climate.
