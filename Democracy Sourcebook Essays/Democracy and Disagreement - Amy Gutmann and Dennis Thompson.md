### General Reading Notes

> Along with a growing number of other political theorists, we call this conception deliberative democracy. The core idea is simple: when citizens or their representatives disagree morally, they should continue to reason together to reach mutually acceptable decisions. But the meaning and implications of the idea are complex. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=33,0,39,47|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

This is in contrast to [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski#^7f06fe|this]] and [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski#^ca27d1|this]] from Przeworski essentially taking for granted that fundamental conflicts will always remain and even grow worse through deliberation.

Also, what does "reason together" mean exactly? If we begin from fundamentally different axioms, what hope is there for reason to help us come together? Maybe the claim is that reason can help us find a compromise, but it's not clear to me that that always exists (e.g., abortion).

> Deliberative democracy involves reasoning about politics, and nothing has been more con- troversial in political philosophy than the nature of reason in politics

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=40,0,49,21|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

Interesting point, I wonder if they mean the normative role of reason in politics or the practical/de facto role.

>  One of our main aims in this book is to cast doubt on the dichotomy between policies and process.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=13,30,16,13|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

Vaguely reminds me of how you have described [[Democratic Justice - Ian Shapiro]].

> Deliberation is not only a means to an end, but also a means for deciding what means are morally required to pursue our common ends. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=37,28,40,28|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

> In the standard theories of democracy —proceduralism and constitutionalism—delib- eration likewise receives little attention.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=57,13,63,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

It seems to me like deliberation could be subsumed by proceduralism?

> In the same spirit, Ju¨ rgen Habermas identifies de- liberative democracy with the idea of a ‘‘decentered society’’ in ‘‘Three Normative Models of Democracy,’’ Constellations, 1 (April 1994)

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=33&selection=159,3,165,16|democracy-sourcebook, page 33]]

Could be an interesting book

> Perhaps because he is content with deliberation among political elites, Bessette is skeptical about pub- licity and argues in favor of secrecy (pp. 208–209)

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=33&selection=227,8,229,51|democracy-sourcebook, page 33]]

> \[Generality:\] Moral arguments apply to everyone who is similarly situated in the morally relevant respects.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=33&selection=129,0,130,44|democracy-sourcebook, page 33]]

> In some familiar theories of justice \[such as Rawls\], moral claims are constructed as hypothetical agreements among individuals who are not accountable to anyone and who are assumed to be living in a just society.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=136,42,150,1|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

Does this really characterize Rawls accurately?

> Actual deliberation has an important advantage over hypothetical agreement: it encourages citi- zens to face up to their actual problems by lis- tening to one another’s moral claims rather than concluding (on the basis of only a thought ex- periment) that their fellow citizens would agree with them on all matters of justice if they were all living in an ideal society.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=160,0,171,31|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

This is probably true to some extent though lol

> Deliberative disagreements lie in the depths be- tween simple misunderstanding and immutable irreconcilability. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=120,0,122,24|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

Not clear to me that real disagreements lie in this area.

> Brian Barry shows how these approaches, when com- bined to evaluate a theory of justice, ‘‘provide a check on one another,’’ in Justice as Impartiality 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=36&selection=132,0,137,1|democracy-sourcebook, page 36]]

Seems interesting

> ‘‘We ac- cept the will of the majority at the end of an electoral process that has been fairly and correctly carried out, but even when we accept the legitimacy of the process we may have grave doubts about the rationality of the outcome.’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=36&selection=206,46,211,9|democracy-sourcebook, page 36]]

I'm getting more and more weirded out with how "rationality" is used. Especially in this quote it seems like rationality is being used as a stand-in for good (as there's no other criteria provided). In what sense would we call an outcome rational or irrational? If all the whites come together vote to enslave the blacks, is this somehow irrational?

>  Our argument is rather that in the absence of robust deliberation in democracy, citizens cannot even provisionally justify many controversial procedures and constitutional rights to one another.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=37&selection=57,12,77,22|democracy-sourcebook, page 37]]

> When citizens deliberate in democratic politics, they express and respect their status as political equals even as they con- tinue to disagree about important matters of public policy.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=37&selection=80,21,84,14|democracy-sourcebook, page 37]]

This seems to presume that they respect each other as political equals to begin with, but that is highly unclear.
### Reasoning Principles in Deliberative Democracy

> The conception consists of three principles—reciprocity, publicity, and accountability—that regulate the process of pol- itics, and three others—basic liberty, basic op- portunity, and fair opportunity—that govern the content of policies. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=76,0,81,21|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

> Taken together the principles constitute a pro- cess that seeks deliberative agreement—on poli- cies that can be provisionally justified to the citizens who are bound by them. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=83,0,86,32|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

> When citizens and accountable o‰cials disagree, and also recognize that they are seeking deliberative agreement, they remain willing to argue with one another with the aim of achieving provisionally justifi- able policies that they all can mutually recognize as such

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=89,27,105,7|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]
#### Reciprocity

> When citizens reason reciprocally, they seek fair terms of social cooperation for their own sake; they try to find mutually acceptable ways of resolving moral disagreements.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=94,22,97,47|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

To flesh this out for myself: reciprocal thinking -> thinking about universal policies that you and everyone else will abide by -> finding policies that everyone will agree to (under the assumption that everyone will follow it). I feel as though I might be misunderstanding this.

> The precise content of reciprocity is di‰cult to determine in theory, but its general counte- nance is familiar enough in practice

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=98,0,100,36|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

> When a disagreement is not deliberative (for example, about a policy to legalize discrimina- tion against blacks and women), citizens do not have any obligations of mutual respect toward their opponents.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=138,0,150,10|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The line feels very blurry between what is reciprocal vs. not, especially in this discrimination case. Some kinds of discrimination are obviously okay; for example, a progressive tax policy is essentially discriminatory against the rich. How do we disambiguate this kind of discrimination (and the form of reasoning to support it) from those against blacks and women?

Okay, actually this quote says "deliberative" not "reciprocal". It's unclear then to me why such a policy is inherently non-deliberative? Can't you have discussion about these sorts of laws (as they did pre-Civil War)?

> Reciprocity asks us to appeal to reasons that are shared or could come to be shared by our fellow citizens. . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=34&selection=90,0,104,24|democracy-sourcebook, page 34]]

> Reciprocity asks that our empirical claims in political argument be consistent with reliable methods of inquiry, as these methods are avail- able to us here and now, not for all times and all places. Neither relativity nor uncertainty is grounds for abandoning the most reliable meth- ods of inquiry at our collective disposal. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=34&selection=141,0,157,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 34]]

How and why does this follow? I could especially see uncertainty as grounds for abandoning certain methods if they are so speculative as to be worthless (e.g., effective altruists' insane calculations and insane policies as a result).
#### Publicity

> Moral conflicts in politics typically take place in public forums or are intended for dissemination in public forums. . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=0,0,14,11|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]
#### Accountability

> One common way in which public officials o¤er an account of their actions is by responding to challenges from reporters

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=21,9,39,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

> Accountability is ultimately to citizens, who not only vote for or against the president but also speak their minds between elections, often through organized groups and intermedi- ary institutions.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=42,7,46,17|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]
### Overall Thoughts

Overall I'm a bit unclear what is being argued in this article. I guess the main thesis is that citizen deliberation is a necessary component to a democracy and merely considering the procedures and constitution doesn't suffice? It's a bit weird to me because it sort of feels like deliberation is, or at least can be, baked into these other conceptions. For example, Schumpeter's notion of competing parties presumably involves some amount of deliberation in the process of the competition.

Maybe one value of this conception could be how we make disagreements fall in the realm of "deliberative" rather than "irreconcilable," because in our polarized climate this notion of deliberative democracy seems useless otherwise.

I didn't really understand the whole discussion about basic rights, but I agree with them that the purist view of deliberation would not fully protect rights. I'm a bit unclear as to what their suggestion is though.

### Reading Notes 

> We address the challenge of moral disagreement here by developing a conception of democracy that secures a central place for moral discussion in political life.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=29,32,32,53|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The goal of the article as stated in the introduction. 

> Along with a growing number of other political theorists, we call this conception deliberative democracy. The core idea is simple: when citizens or their representatives disagree morally, they should continue to reason together to reach mutually acceptable decisions.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=33,0,38,30|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

A summary of the core idea behind deliberative democracy. 

> The aim of the moral reasoning that our deliberative democracy prescribes falls between impartiality, which requires something like altruism, and prudence, which demands no more than enlightened self-interest

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=75,0,93,29|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

A summary of the moral reasoning prescribed by their version of deliberative democracy. 

> Its first principle is reciprocity. . . . When citizens reason reciprocally, they seek fair terms of social cooperation for their own sake; they try to find mutually acceptable ways of resolving moral disagreements. The precise content of reciprocity is difficult to determine in theory, but its general countenance is familiar enough in practice. It can be seen in the difference between acting in one’s self-interest (say, taking advantage of a legal loophole or a lucky break) and acting fairly (following rules in the spirit that one expects others to adopt). 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=93,32,107,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The authors describe reciprocity, the first principle of the moral reasoning behind deliberative democracy (which contains elements of altruism and prudence). 

> Even though the quality of deliberation and the conditions under which it is conducted are far from ideal in the controversies we consider, the fact that in each case some citizens and some officials make arguments consistent with reciprocity suggests that a deliberative perspective is not utopian.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=31&selection=112,7,118,20|democracy-sourcebook, page 31]]

The authors claim that officials do make arguments in the real world consistent with reciprocity and therefore the deliberative perspective is not utopian.  

>  Having good reason as individuals to believe that a policy is just does not mean that collectively as citizens we have sufficient justification to legislate on the basis of those reasons. The moral authority of collective judgements about policy depends in part on the moral quality of the process by which citizens collectively reach those judgements. Deliberation is the most appropriate way for citizens collectively to resolve their moral disagreements not only about policies but also about the process by which policies should be adopted. Deliberation is not only a means to an end, but also a means for deciding what means are morally required to pursue our common ends. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=16,13,40,29|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

The authors argue that democracy itself provides the moral justification for legislature. 

> In the standard theories of democracy —proceduralism and constitutionalism—deliberation likewise receives little attention. These theories are surprisingly silent about the need for ongoing discussion of moral disagreement in everyday political life. As a result, we suffer from a deliberative deficit not only in our democratic politics but also in our democratic theory. We are unlikely to lower the deficit in our politics if we do not also reduce it in our theory.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=57,13,70,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

The authors critique procedural democracy for not addressing the need for deliberation on moral disagreement. Furthermore they suggest that such an oversight has real world consequences. Perhaps a counter argument to this would be the "crossfire" line of reasoning from the Shapiro lectures and MacIntyre. It seems to me that we often do try to deliberate as some sort of facade, but the underlying disagreements are too great to be overcome by a much higher level discussion. Yet perhaps the authors would argue that they are not arguing with deliberative principles (reciprocity for example). 

> The conception of deliberative democracy that we defend here seeks to diminish that deficit in theory and in politics. The conception consists of three principles—reciprocity, publicity, and accountability—that regulate the process of politics, and three others—basic liberty, basic opportunity, and fair opportunity—that govern the content of policies.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=32&selection=71,0,81,20|democracy-sourcebook, page 32]]

The six main principles of deliberative democracy. Three that regulate the process of politics and three the govern the content of policies. 

> In some familiar theories of justice, moral claims are constructed as hypothetical agreements among individuals who are not accountable to anyone and who are assumed to be living in a just society. In such a society no one would need to argue for or against preferential hiring as a means of overcoming racial or gender discrimination because no such discrimination would exist in that society. Deliberative democracy, in contrast, admits reasons and principles that are suitable for actual societies, which all still suffer from discrimination and other kinds of injustice. Actual deliberation has an important advantage over hypothetical agreement: it encourages citizens to face up to their actual problems by listening to one another’s moral claims rather than concluding (on the basis of only a thought experiment) that their fellow citizens would agree with them on all matters of justice if they were all living in an ideal society.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=136,42,171,31|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

The authors again provide a consequential argument for deliberative democracy. 

> Deliberative democracy does not assume that the results of all actual deliberations are just. In fact, most of the time democracies fall far short of meeting the conditions that deliberative democracy prescribes. But we can say that the more nearly the conditions are satisfied, the more nearly justifiable are the results likely to be.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=35&selection=172,0,177,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 35]]

This is an interesting claim which has both an empirical and normative element. 

> Habermas seems to imply that a provisionally justifiable resolution of moral conflicts in politics dependsolely on satisfying the conditions of delibera- tion. Principles such as basic liberty and opportunity therefore are valued only for their contribution to deliberation, not as constraints on what counts as a morally legitimate resolu- tion of disagreement. If leaving ‘‘all concrete moral and ethical judgments to participants themselves’’ means that principles such as liberty and opportunity should never constrain these judgments, then discourse theory does not adequately protect basic rights.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=36&selection=64,0,66,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 36]]


> Seyla Benhabib, argues that deliberation can ensure the legitimacy but not the rationality of outcomes: ‘‘We accept the will of the majority at the end of an electoral process that has been fairly and correctly carried out, but even when we accept the legitimacy of the process we may have grave doubts about the rationality of the outcome.’’ If deliberation aims only at legitimacy, and legitimacy is defined as whatever ‘‘results from the free and unconstrained public deliberation of all about matters of common concern,’’ then deliberation may succeed (by definition) at ensuring legitimacy. Benhabib, ‘‘Deliberative Rationality,’’ p. 26. But this concept of legitimacy has too little moral content to provide a robust defense of deliberative democracy. Why should we defend deliberation, so understood, over a conception of deliberative democracy that is dedicated both to respecting basic liberty and opportunity and to subjecting these principles to ongoing deliberation?

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=36&selection=204,45,222,49|democracy-sourcebook, page 36]]

The authors put some limitation on deliberation. Suggesting that it alone is not enough to justify legitimacy or rationality. 

> Insofar as deliberation is missing in political life, citizens also lack a mutually justifiable way of living with their ongoing moral disagreements. When citizens deliberate in democratic politics, they express and respect their status as political equals even as they continue to disagree about important matters of public policy.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=37&selection=77,24,84,14|democracy-sourcebook, page 37]]
### Additional Questions and Comments

> Sometimes the assumptions are obviously true: only women bear children.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=34&selection=132,20,133,45|democracy-sourcebook, page 34]]

This is funny given the current cultural climate.

### Overall Thoughts

Firstly I have to criticise the choice of excerpt here. I feel like there was not enough content in the article and the examples that are discussed but not actually shown are probably important to understanding/buying the argument. 

Secondly I would say that the perspective presented here is probably very similar to my view before starting the Shapiro lectures. 

I think that deliberation certainly plays an important role in Democracy which is not discussed in the articles about the procedural definition. Whether this means deliberation should be a part of the definition, I am not sure. 

My first concern is that it is not clear to what extent we can come to rational agreement (although this is definitely an important topic to study). To quote [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski]]"

> Yet in the end, when all the coalitions have been formed, the practical consensus has been elaborated, and all arguments have been exhausted, conflicts remain.

My second concern is that it feels like it relies on a society where everyone wants to be a strongly active participant in the democracy. While I like the idea of this I have become increasingly pessimistic that this is a realistic ideal (and its not clear that it is "ideal"). The articles of Schumpeter and Przeworksi as well as the lectures of Shapiro paints of picture of the world where the majority of people have a more passive participation in politics until a strong conflict or perceived injustice arises against themselves or their group/community. In this context it perhaps makes more sense to view democracy as a competition for leadership (as in Schumpeter) rather than a deliberative process all the way down. While political parties may start from broad shared principles, it seems that their manoeuvring from election to election may be better described by trying to build coalitions and win over voters rather than trying to come to deliberative agreements based on rational or moral argument. 

One nice aspect of the procedural definitions is that the feels like it relies much less on strong assumptions about human psychology (perhaps also sociology and anthropology), while it certainly does still have assumptions they feel much lighter (the assumptions under which its ideal might be equally strong, but the assumptions under which it works is weaker).
