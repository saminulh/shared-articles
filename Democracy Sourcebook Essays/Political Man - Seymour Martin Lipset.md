# Excerpts
> Perhaps the most common generalization linking political systems to other aspects of soci- ety has been that democracy is related to the state of economic development. The more well- to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=69&selection=11,0,24,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 69]]
- The most common hypothesis is that democracy is related to economic development

> Education presumably broadens man’s outlook, enables him to understand the need for norms of toler- ance, restrains him from adhering to extremist doctrines, and increases his capacity to make rational electoral choices.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=5,0,18,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- Education is hypothesized to improve one's tolerance for others and increase rational capacities

> \[Findings on within-country associations between education and belief in democratic values\] should lead us to anticipate a far higher correlation between national levels of education and political practice than we in fact find. Germany and France have been among the best educated nations of Europe, but this by itself did not stabilize their democracies.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=53,0,58,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- There is a high correlation within country between education level and belief in democratic values, but this apparently does not translate to between countries, as exemplified by Germany and France.

> The purpose of German edu- cation, according to Dewey, writing in 1916, was one of ‘‘disciplinary training rather than of personal devel- opment.’’ The main aim was to produce ‘‘absorption of the aims and meaning of existing institutions,’’ and ‘‘thoroughgoing subordination’’ to them.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=184,24,189,40|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- German education is claimed by [[John Dewey]] to train disciplines rather than personal growth

> If we cannot say that a ‘‘high’’ level of educa- tion is a su‰cient condition for democracy, the available evidence suggests that it comes close to being a necessary one. In Latin America, where widespread illiteracy still exists, only one of all the nations in which more than half the popula- tion is illiterate—Brazil—can be included in the ‘‘more democratic’’ group. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=64,0,79,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- Education appears to be _necessary_ for democracy

> Economic development, producing increased income, greater economic security, and wide- spread higher education, largely determines the form of the ‘‘class struggle,’’ by permitting those in the lower strata to develop longer time per- spectives and more complex and gradualist views of politics. A belief in secular reformist gradual- ism can be the ideology of only a relatively well- to-do lower class.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=72&selection=16,0,24,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 72]]
- The lower classes will only fight through reformist gradualism if they are already well-to-do.

> This statement \[that economic development is correlated to democracy\] is a ‘‘statistical’’ statement, which necessarily means that there will be many exceptions to the correlation. Thus we know that poorer people are more likely to vote for the Democratic or Labor parties in the U.S. and England. The fact that a large minority of the lower strata vote for the more conservative party in these countries does not challenge the proposition that stratification position is a main determinant of party choice.

- The observations of economic development being correlated to democracy is "statistical" and so not always true.

> In the two wealthiest countries, the United States and Canada, not only are communist parties almost nonexistent but socialist parties have never been able to establish themselves as major forces.

^31871d

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=72&selection=41,0,57,13|democracy-sourcebook, page 72]]
- Communists and socialists never took hold in the two wealthiest countries, USA and Canada.

> In the eight Euro- pean countries which were below the $500 per capita income mark in 1949—France, Iceland, Czechoslovakia, Finland, West Germany, Hun- gary, Italy, and Austria—and which have had at least one postwar democratic election in which both communist and noncommunist parties could compete, the Communist party has had more than 16 percent of the vote in six, and an over-all average of more than 20 percent in the eight countries as a group.

- Communists had some amount of power in the 8 poorest European countries with democratic elections in 1949.

> This does not mean that economic hardship or poverty per se is the main cause of radicalism. There is much evidence to sustain the argu- ment that stable poverty in a situation in which individuals are not exposed to the possibilities of change breeds, if anything, conservatism

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=73&selection=127,0,150,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 73]]
- Economic hardship might not cause radicalism per se and evidence from [[Emile Durkheim]] argues that this instead breeds conservatism.

> Karl Marx put it in a perceptive passage: ‘‘A house may be large or small; as long as the sur- rounding houses are equally small it satisfies all social demands for a dwelling. But if a palace arises beside the little house, the little house shrinks into a hut.’’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=73&selection=177,0,192,21|democracy-sourcebook, page 73]]
- [[Karl Marx]] quote on how people view things in relation to others they are surrounded by.

## Questions and comments
- Re [[#^bca077]]: Is this footnote pointing to the right part of the text? The area this footnote comes from doesn't really look like it's talking about poor people and lower classes. Anyways, this footnote would still suggest that something deeper than just "class struggle" may be going on (perhaps less obvious in 1959).
- Re [[#^31871d]]: Canada was once the second-wealthiest country in the world?
- Re [[#^eec328]]: Kind of wild to be using data from 4 years after WWII.
