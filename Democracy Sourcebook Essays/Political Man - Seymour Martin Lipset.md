# Excerpts
> Perhaps the most common generalization linking political systems to other aspects of soci- ety has been that democracy is related to the state of economic development. The more well- to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=69&selection=11,0,24,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 69]]
- The most common hypothesis is that democracy is related to economic development

> Education presumably broadens man’s outlook, enables him to understand the need for norms of toler- ance, restrains him from adhering to extremist doctrines, and increases his capacity to make rational electoral choices.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=5,0,18,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- Education is hypothesized to improve one's tolerance for others and increase rational capacities

> \[Findings on within-country associations between education and belief in democratic values\] should lead us to anticipate a far higher correlation between national levels of education and political practice than we in fact find. Germany and France have been among the best educated nations of Europe, but this by itself did not stabilize their democracies.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=53,0,58,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- There is a high correlation within country between education level and belief in democratic values, but this apparently does not translate to between countries, as exemplified by Germany and France.

> The purpose of German edu- cation, according to Dewey, writing in 1916, was one of ‘‘disciplinary training rather than of personal devel- opment.’’ The main aim was to produce ‘‘absorption of the aims and meaning of existing institutions,’’ and ‘‘thoroughgoing subordination’’ to them.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=184,24,189,40|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- German education is claimed by [[John Dewey]] to train disciplines rather than personal growth

> If we cannot say that a ‘‘high’’ level of educa- tion is a su‰cient condition for democracy, the available evidence suggests that it comes close to being a necessary one. In Latin America, where widespread illiteracy still exists, only one of all the nations in which more than half the popula- tion is illiterate—Brazil—can be included in the ‘‘more democratic’’ group. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=71&selection=64,0,79,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 71]]
- Education appears to be _necessary_ for democracy

> Economic development, producing increased income, greater economic security, and wide- spread higher education, largely determines the form of the ‘‘class struggle,’’ by permitting those in the lower strata to develop longer time per- spectives and more complex and gradualist views of politics. A belief in secular reformist gradual- ism can be the ideology of only a relatively well- to-do lower class.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=72&selection=16,0,24,18|democracy-sourcebook, page 72]]
- The lower classes will only fight through reformist gradualism if they are already well-to-do.

> This statement \[that economic development is correlated to democracy\] is a ‘‘statistical’’ statement, which necessarily means that there will be many exceptions to the correlation. Thus we know that poorer people are more likely to vote for the Democratic or Labor parties in the U.S. and England. The fact that a large minority of the lower strata vote for the more conservative party in these countries does not challenge the proposition that stratification position is a main determinant of party choice.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=72&selection=135,4,143,13|democracy-sourcebook, page 72]]
- The observations of economic development being correlated to democracy is "statistical" and so not always true.

> In the two wealthiest countries, the United States and Canada, not only are communist parties almost nonexistent but socialist parties have never been able to establish themselves as major forces.

^31871d

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=72&selection=41,0,57,13|democracy-sourcebook, page 72]]
- Communists and socialists never took hold in the two wealthiest countries, USA and Canada.

> In the eight Euro- pean countries which were below the $500 per capita income mark in 1949—France, Iceland, Czechoslovakia, Finland, West Germany, Hun- gary, Italy, and Austria—and which have had at least one postwar democratic election in which both communist and noncommunist parties could compete, the Communist party has had more than 16 percent of the vote in six, and an over-all average of more than 20 percent in the eight countries as a group.

^eec328

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=72&selection=68,26,69,44|democracy-sourcebook, page 72]]
- Communists had some amount of power in the 8 poorest European countries with democratic elections in 1949.

> This does not mean that economic hardship or poverty per se is the main cause of radicalism. There is much evidence to sustain the argu- ment that stable poverty in a situation in which individuals are not exposed to the possibilities of change breeds, if anything, conservatism

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=73&selection=127,0,150,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 73]]
- Economic hardship might not cause radicalism per se and evidence from [[Emile Durkheim]] argues that this instead breeds conservatism.

> Karl Marx put it in a perceptive passage: ‘‘A house may be large or small; as long as the sur- rounding houses are equally small it satisfies all social demands for a dwelling. But if a palace arises beside the little house, the little house shrinks into a hut.’’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=73&selection=177,0,192,21|democracy-sourcebook, page 73]]
- [[Karl Marx]] quote on how people view things in relation to others they are surrounded by.

> A summary of the findings of election studies in many countries shows that, with few exceptions, there is a strong relationship between lower social position and support of ‘‘leftist’’ politics. There are, of course, many other characteristics which are also related to left voting, some of which are found among relatively well paid but socially isolated groups. Among the population as a whole, men are much more likely to vote for the left than women, while members of mi- nority religious and ethnic groups also display a leftist tendency.

^82f045

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=74&selection=101,4,125,9|democracy-sourcebook, page 74]]
- Leftist tendencies are associated with lower social position, men, and minorities.

> The fact that the form which these political parties take in poorer countries is more extremist and radical than it is in wealthier ones is probably more related to the greater de- gree of inequality in such countries than to the fact that their poor are actually poorer in abso- lute terms.

^43a103

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=74&selection=27,0,33,11|democracy-sourcebook, page 74]]
- Radicalism is probably more related to inequality than absolute wealth. 

> The distribution of consumption goods also tends to become more equitable as the size of national income increases.

^bd594a

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=74&selection=69,0,85,29|democracy-sourcebook, page 74]]
- Inequality tends to lessen with absolute wealth.

> Marx believed that the proletariat was a revo- lutionary force because it had nothing to lose but its chains and could win the whole world. But Tocqueville, analyzing the reasons why the lower strata in America supported the system, para- phrased and transposed Marx before Marx ever made his analysis by pointing out that ‘‘only those who have nothing to lose ever revolt.’’

^c64285

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=75&selection=65,0,72,45|democracy-sourcebook, page 75]]
- [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]] both said that revolutionaries are those with nothing to lose in the current order.

> The political values and style of the upper class, too, are related to national income. The poorer a country and the lower the absolute standard of living of the lower classes, the greater the pressure on the upper strata to treat the lower as vulgar, innately inferior, a lower caste beyond the pale of human society.

^4fe76e

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=75&selection=101,0,121,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 75]]
- The poorer the country and their lower class, the more pressure there is for the upper class to dehumanize them.

> If there is enough wealth in the country so that it does not make too much di¤erence whether some redistribution takes place, it is easier to accept the idea that it does not matter greatly which side is in power.

^4648bc

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=75&selection=155,44,172,23|democracy-sourcebook, page 75]]
- Greater wealth can enable greater redistribution and reduce the returns to power, thus increasing democracy.

> it has been suggested, by Weber among others, that a historically unique concat- enation of elements produced both democracy and capitalism in this area.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=76&selection=103,18,103,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 76]]
- [[Max Weber]] argues that a historically unique circumstances led to both democracy and capitalism and northwest Europe and its offspring.

> In introducing historical events as part of the analysis of factors external to the political system, which are part of the causal nexus in which democracy is involved, I am following in good sociological and even functionalist tradition. As Radcli¤e-Brown has well put it: ‘‘. . . one ‘explanation’ of a social system will be its history, where we know it—the detailed ac- count of how it came to be what it is and where it is. Another ‘explanation’ of the same system is obtained by showing . . . that it is a special exemplification of laws of social psychology or social functioning. The two kinds of explanation do not conflict but supple- ment one another.’’

^69e161

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=77&selection=56,4,86,19|democracy-sourcebook, page 77]]
- Lipset's approach is to intentionally keep the history as external to the political systems.

## Questions and comments
- Re [[#^bca077]]: Is this footnote pointing to the right part of the text? The area this footnote comes from doesn't really look like it's talking about poor people and lower classes. Anyways, this footnote would still suggest that something deeper than just "class struggle" may be going on (perhaps less obvious in 1959).
- Re [[#^31871d]]: Canada was once the second-wealthiest country in the world?
- Re [[#^eec328]]: Kind of wild to be using data from 4 years after WWII.
- Re [[#^82f045]]: Interesting, I think the claim about sex has reversed (at least in the US).
- Re [[#^43a103]]: Does he ever compare these?
- Re [[#^bd594a]]: Curious how true this is now.
- Re [[#^c64285]]: Kind of funny lol.
- Re [[#^4fe76e]]: Seems more related, if anything, to inequality than wealth (e.g., welfare queens, but I guess that hasn't happened yet). This whole paragraph is kind of odd IMO.
- Re [[#^4648bc]]: I guess [[Adam Przeworski]] does some analysis of this?
- Re [[#^69e161]]: Interesting
## Final thoughts
The statistical results of course aren't super compelling, just a ton of associational data, can't really make much meaningful causal analysis from it. A lot of other theorizing happening, some of which is interesting, but also felt at times a bit "synthesis illusion"
