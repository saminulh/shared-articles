## Notes
> At the beginning of the century the size and complexity of industrialized societies and the emergence of bureaucratic forms of organisation seemed to many empirically minded writers on politics to cast grave doubts on the possibility of the attainment of democracy as that concept was usually understood.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=5,0,25,19|democracy-sourcebook, page 53]]
- Complexity of society made idealized democracy seem unattainable

> But by the middle of the century even the ideal itself seemed to many to have been called in question; at least, "democracy" was still the ideal, but it was the emphasis on participation that had become suspect and with it the "classical" formulation of democratic theory.

- Eventually, the classical idealized notation itself was called into question

> The spectre of totalitarianism also helps explain the concern with the necessary conditions for stability in a democratic polity

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=75,24,78,6|democracy-sourcebook, page 53]]
- Fear of totalitarianism caused a focus on maintaining stability

> the outstanding characteristic of most citi- zens, more especially those in the lower socio- economic status (SES) groups, is a general lack of interest in politics and political activity and further, that widespread non-democratic or authoritarian attitudes exist, again particularly among lower socio-economic status groups

- Most citizens are uninterested in politics and also harbor non-democratic attitudes

> There was a further factor that helped along the process of the rejection of earlier democratic theories, and that was the now familiar argument that those theories were normative and ‘‘value- laden,’’ whereas modern political theory should be scientific and empirical, grounded firmly in the facts of political life.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=159,0,165,28|democracy-sourcebook, page 53]]
- Early democratic theories were seen as normative and value-laden, while modern theorists want to be more empirical.

> is extraordinarily in- fluential book Capitalism, Socialism and Democ- racy (1943) was in fact written before the vast amounts of empirical information that we now have on politics became available

- [[Capitalism, Socialism, and  Democracy - Joseph Schumpeter]] is very influential
## Thoughts
- Re [[#^a9c8e5]] and [[#^5024fa]]: Is she mostly talking here about the collective will notions of democracy?
- Re [[#^d8042a]]: It's interesting to link the preferences in theoretical understandings of democracy with the de facto attitudes of the people. However, the two attributes (political disinterest and non-democratic tendencies) seem somewhat at odds in this thesis: if people are disinterested because participation leads to totalitarianism, then they wouldn't hold non-democratic beliefs
- Re [[#^a89844]]: This is related to our thoughts on [[Defining and Developing Democracy - Larry Diamond]] vs. [[Capitalism, Socialism, and  Democracy - Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski]].
- Re [[#^217310]]: Is the rest of the book (beyond the excerpt we read) influential lol? I've only heard this part talked about (selection bias of course)
