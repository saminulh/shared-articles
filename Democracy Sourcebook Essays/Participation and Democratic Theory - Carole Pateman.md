## Highlights
> At the beginning of the century the size and complexity of industrialized societies and the emergence of bureaucratic forms of organisation seemed to many empirically minded writers on politics to cast grave doubts on the possibility of the attainment of democracy as that concept was usually understood. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=5,0,25,19|page 53]])
^a9c8e5
- Complexity of society made idealized democracy seem unattainable

> But by the middle of the century even the ideal itself seemed to many to have been called in question; at least, "democracy" was still the ideal, but it was the emphasis on participation that had become suspect and with it the "classical" formulation of democratic theory. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=26,0,52,0|page 53]])
^5024fa
- Eventually, the classical idealized notation itself was called into question

> The spectre of totalitarianism also helps explain the concern with the necessary conditions for stability in a democratic polity ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=75,24,78,6|page 53]])
- Fear of totalitarianism caused a focus on maintaining stability

> the outstanding characteristic of most citi- zens, more especially those in the lower socio- economic status (SES) groups, is a general lack of interest in politics and political activity and further, that widespread non-democratic or authoritarian attitudes exist, again particularly among lower socio-economic status groups ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=114,5,128,40|page 53]])
^d8042a
- Most citizens are uninterested in politics and also harbor non-democratic attitudes

> There was a further factor that helped along the process of the rejection of earlier democratic theories, and that was the now familiar argument that those theories were normative and ‘‘value- laden,’’ whereas modern political theory should be scientific and empirical, grounded firmly in the facts of political life. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=159,0,165,28|page 53]])
^a89844
- Early democratic theories were seen as normative and value-laden, while modern theorists want to be more empirical.

> is extraordinarily in- fluential book Capitalism, Socialism and Democ- racy (1943) was in fact written before the vast amounts of empirical information that we now have on politics became available ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=193,23,201,33|page 53]])
^217310
- [[Capitalism, Socialism, and  Democracy - Joseph Schumpeter]] is very influential

> The theories of participatory democracy . . . were not just essays in prescription as is often claimed, rather they o¤er just those ‘‘plans of action and specific prescriptions’’ for movement towards a (truly) democratic polity that it has been sug- gested are lacking ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=14,0,19,18|page 54]])
- The purpose of participatory democracy theory is to offer paths towards a truly democratic polity

> The theory of participatory democracy is built round the central assertion that individuals and their institutions cannot be considered in isola- tion from one another. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=50,0,53,22|page 54]])
- Participatory democracy is centered on the idea that the individual and their institutions are inseparably linked

> for maximum partici- pation by all the people at \[the national level\] social- isation, or ‘‘social training,’’ for democracy must take place in other spheres in order that the necessary individual attitudes and psychological qualities can be developed. This development takes place through the process of participation itself. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=67,24,74,7|page 54]])
^d0af79
- Participation enables the "social training" for people to take part in national level politics

> Therefore, for a democratic polity to exist it is necessary for a participatory society to exist, i.e. a society where all political systems have been democratised and socialisation through partici- pation can take place in all areas. The most im- portant area is industry; most individuals spend a great deal of their lifetime at work and the business of the workplace provides an education in the management of collective a¤airs that it is di‰cult to parallel elsewhere ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=103,0,107,35|page 54]])
^c7ae27
- A democratic polity requires all political systems to be democratized and for socialization through participation to take place in all areas
- Especially this should occur in the workplace

>  The second aspect of the theory of participatory democracy is that spheres such as industry should be seen as polit- ical systems in their own right, o¤ering areas of participation additional to the national level ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=112,30,116,46|page 54]])
- Spheres like industry ought to be seen as political in their own right

> If individuals are to exercise the maximum amount of control over their own lives and environment then authority structures in these areas must be so organised that they can participate in decision making. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=116,48,121,7|page 54]])
^5252c9
- Democratization must occur to let individuals the exercise the maximum amount of control over their own lives and environment

> A further reason for the central place of industry in the theory relates to the substan- tive measure of economic equality required to give the individual the independence and secu- rity necessary for (equal) participation ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=121,8,125,40|page 54]])
- Economic equality is necessary for equal participation

> the justification for a democratic system in the participatory theory of democracy rests primarily on the human results that accrue from the participatory process. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=55&selection=5,35,9,8|page 55]])
^6dae63
- The main justification for democracy through a participatory theory is how it changes and benefits the people.

> For example, the fact that it is a model of a self-sustaining system might make it attractive to the many writers on politics who, explicitly or implicitly, make use of such models. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=55&selection=24,7,27,39|page 55]])

> Dahl (1963, p. 6), has defined a political system as ‘‘any persistent pattern of human relationships that involves to a significant extent power, rule or authority.’’ ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=55&selection=49,30,52,47|page 55]])
- [[Robert Dahl]]'s definition of a political system

> \[Contemporary theorists\] are far less clear on how \[democratic character\] could be developed or what the nature of its connection with the working of the ‘‘democratic method’’ itself really is. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=30,37,38,3|page 56]])

> No longer is democratic theory centred on the participation of ‘‘the people,’’ on the participa- tion of the ordinary man, or the prime virtue of a democratic political system seen as the devel- opment of politically relevant and necessary qualities in the ordinary individual; in the con- temporary theory of democracy it is the partici- pation of the minority e´lite that is crucial and the non-participation of the apathetic, ordinary man lacking in the feeling of political e‰cacy, that is regarded as the main bulwark against instability. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=148,0,169,49|page 56]])
^0a9d42
- Contemporary theory no longer cares about the participation and development of the ordinary man, instead wants to preserve an elite to protect against instability.

> Apparently it has not occurred to recent theorists to wonder why there should be a positive corre- lation between apathy and low feelings of politi- cal e‰cacy and low socio-economic status ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=170,0,173,40|page 56]])
^a10527
- Recent theorists do not consider why political apathy correlates with SES.

> Yet we have seen that the evidence supports the arguments of Rousseau, Mill and Cole that we do learn to participate by partic- ipating and that feelings of political e‰cacy are more likely to be developed in a participatory environment. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=194,10,200,0|page 56]])
- Evidence shows participation begets participation

> However, the socialisation aspect of the par- ticipatory theory of democracy is also capable of being absorbed into the general framework of the contemporary theory, providing the founda- tion for a more soundly based theory of stable democracy than those o¤ered at present. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=57&selection=27,0,32,39|page 57]])
- The idea of socialization can be absorbed into the general framework of contemporary theory

> a society so organised that every individual has the opportunity directly to participate in all political spheres ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=57&selection=66,7,68,17|page 57]])
- Necessary feature of a democratic polity for participatory theorists

> There is very little in the empirical evidence on which to base the assertion that in- dustrial democracy, full higher level participa- tion, is impossible ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=57&selection=93,17,96,19|page 57]])
^cdf818
- Little empirical evidence (at the time) about industrial democracy being impossible

> The problems of running large housing developments would seem to give wide scope to residents for participation in decision making and the psychological e¤ects of such partici- pation might prove extremely valuable in this context ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=58&selection=87,9,104,7|page 58]])
^598b97

> The argument of the participatory theory of democracy is that participation in the alternative areas would enable the individual better to appreciate the connection between the public and the private spheres ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=59&selection=59,35,76,7|page 59]])
- Participation enables better appreciation of the connection between public and private spheres.
## Thoughts
- Re [[#^a9c8e5]] and [[#^5024fa]]: Is she mostly talking here about the collective will notions of democracy?
- Re [[#^d8042a]]: It's interesting to link the preferences in theoretical understandings of democracy with the de facto attitudes of the people. However, the two attributes (political disinterest and non-democratic tendencies) seem somewhat at odds in this thesis: if people are disinterested because participation leads to totalitarianism, then they wouldn't hold non-democratic beliefs
- Re [[#^a89844]]: This is related to our thoughts on [[Defining and Developing Democracy - Larry Diamond]] vs. [[Capitalism, Socialism, and  Democracy - Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski]].
- Re [[#^217310]]: Is the rest of the book (beyond the excerpt we read) influential lol? I've only heard this part talked about (selection bias of course)
- Re [[#^d0af79]]: Not necessarily wrong, but "social training" and having the right "psychological qualities" gives very weird vibes lol. I can definitely see something like this going horribly wrong (I guess I have internalized the same fears as the contemporary theorists)
- Re [[#^c7ae27]]: Did I miss a definition of "democratic polity"? It seems to be taken as the goal state, but I guess I can't evaluate if this statement follows without exactly understanding democratic polity means.
- Re [[#^5252c9]]: Why do we care about this necessarily?
- Re [[#^6dae63]]: I guess I'm so contemporary-pilled that this feels like a completely different thing lol.
- Re [[#^c0ea97]]: I think this is the second time this idea has been brought (I assume this idea is mainly that participation begets participation). But I feel like this is a relatively surface-level thing to bring up? It's very high level and abstracts away key problems of, for example, the incentives of the agents and stability of the system. The way [[Adam Przeworski]] did a similar thing in [[Minimalist Conception of Democracy - Adam Przeworski]] I feel like is much more compelling, despite also being very abstract. I guess she's saying others can flesh this idea out better, but it feels weird to keep bringing it up.
- Re [[#^8cf7e0]]: This reminds me of how the prescriptions for achieving liberalism felt lacking in [[The Rise of Illiberal Democracy - Fareed Zakaria]] (of course, he specifically wasn't advocating for democracy, but I can kind of see liberalism as a kind of stand-in for "democratic character")
- Re [[#^0a9d42]]: I think I can believe the first part of this quote, that theorists aren't necessarily interested in personal political development as an intrinsic good. The second part seems unfair though? I can't think of any of the articles we've read or [[Responsible Parties - Frances McCall Rosenbluth and Ian Shapiro]] specifically arguing for lower participation (maybe you can say that low participation is a corollary of their positions, but that's a very different claim from "regarded as the main bulwark"). To be fair, this is a pretty old article relative to everything else (like, I would guess [[#^a10527]] is not true anymore), so maybe that explains some of this.
- Re [[#^cdf818]]: I'm really curious about this, I remember [[What Have I Learned from Marx and What Still Stands - Adam Przeworski#^21b6bf|Przeworski]] mentioning that reforms along these lines failed.
- Re [[#^598b97]]: I wish we were more specific about "psychological effects" (not just here, but throughout) and what this means as a normative goal.
## Final Thoughts
I feel like too much of this excerpt was spent on critiquing the contemporary school rather than giving more detail about the system being proposed. It feels hard to engage with something at this high level of abstraction--the way this reads to me feels like how communists might say that in the communist utopia, everyone will work for the common good and we will achieve paradise. That's not even to mention the political attainability of her (pretty radical) proposals (again a similar issue with communists).

It also seems like, at least at the time of publishing, there was little theoretical understanding of the participatory system and this article/book was meant sort of as a call to arms. In this case, I would have preferred a more modern treatment that actually takes into account more theoretical developments as well as empirical evidence.

That all being said, I think there are good high-level points about increasing participation in politics, and importantly, that this participation doesn't need to be in the national level. The main sphere she brought up was industry, but many of the arguments would apply just as well (IMO) for simply local government. So perhaps a less radical, and more attainable, version of participatory democracy is a focus on increase civic engagement at local levels.

## Reading Notes

> The collapse of the Weimar Republic, with its high rates of mass participation, into fascism, and the post-war establishment of totalitarian regimes based on mass participation, albeit participation backed by intimidation and coercion, underlay the tendency for ‘‘participation’’ to become linked to the concept of totalitarianism rather than that of democracy.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=53,0,75,23|democracy-sourcebook, page 53]]

Interesting historical note.

>  Data from large-scale empirical investigations into political attitudes and behaviour, undertaken in most Western countries over the past twenty or thirty years, have revealed
>  that the outstanding characteristic of most citizens, more especially those in the lower socio-economic status (SES) groups, is a general lack of interest in politics and political activity and further, that widespread non-democratic or authoritarian attitudes exist, again particularly among lower socio-economic status groups. The conclusion drawn (often by political sociologists wearing political theorists’ hats) is that the ‘‘classical’’ picture of democratic man is hopelessly unrealistic, and moreover, that in view of the facts about political attitudes, an increase in political participation by present non- participants could upset the stability of the democratic system.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=53&selection=110,15,113,46|democracy-sourcebook, page 53]]

Empirical data suggests that the majority of citizens in the west have a general lack of interest in politics and political activity (especially among lower income individuals). The author suggests that the conclusions many political sociologists derive from this data is perhaps faulty. 

> The theory of participatory democracy is built round the central assertion that individuals and their institutions cannot be considered in isolation from one another. The existence of representative institutions at national level is not sufficient for democracy; for maximum participation by all the people at that level socialisation, or ‘‘social training,’’ for democracy must take place in other spheres in order that the necessary individual attitudes and psychological qualities can be developed. This development takes place through the process of participation itself.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=50,0,74,7|democracy-sourcebook, page 54]]

> The major function of participation in the theory of participatory democracy is therefore an educative one, educative in the very widest sense, including both the psychological aspect and the gaining of practice in democratic skills and procedures. Thus there is no special problem about the stability of a participatory system; it is self- sustaining through the educative impact of the participatory process. Participation develops and fosters the very qualities necessary for it; the more individuals participate the better able they become to do so. Subsidiary hypotheses about participation are that it has an integrative effect and that it aids the acceptance of collective decisions.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=74,8,76,50|democracy-sourcebook, page 54]]

The author explains the central role of education in participatory democracy. 

> Therefore, for a democratic polity to exist it is necessary for a participatory society to exist, i.e. a society where all political systems have been democratised and socialisation through partici- pation can take place in all areas. The most im- portant area is industry; most individuals spend a great deal of their lifetime at work and the business of the workplace provides an education in the management of collective a¤airs that it is di‰cult to parallel elsewhere. The second aspect of the theory of participatory democracy is that spheres such as industry should be seen as polit- ical systems in their own right, o¤ering areas of participation additional to the national level. If individuals are to exercise the maximum amount of control over their own lives and environment then authority structures in these areas must be so organised that they can participate in decision making. A further reason for the central place of industry in the theory relates to the substan- tive measure of economic equality required to give the individual the independence and secu- rity necessary for (equal) participation; the dem- ocratising of industrial authority structures, abolishing the permanent distinction between ‘‘managers’’ and ‘‘men’’ would mean a large step toward meeting this condition.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=54&selection=103,0,145,30|democracy-sourcebook, page 54]]

The author suggests that all areas of society need to be democratised in participatory democracy, particularly and especially industry. 

> Despite the stress most modern political theorists lay on the em- pirical and scientific nature of their discipline they display, at least so far as democratic theory is concerned, a curious reluctance to look at the facts in a questioning spirit. That is, they seem reluctant to see whether or not a theoretical ex- planation can be o¤ered of why the political facts are as they are; instead they have taken it for granted that one theory which could possibly have yielded an explanation had already been shown to be outmoded, and so concentrated on uncritically building a ‘‘realistic’’ theory to fit the facts as revealed by political sociology.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=94,30,107,41|democracy-sourcebook, page 56]]

> The result of this one-sided procedure has been not only a democratic theory that has unrecognised normative implications, implica- tions that set the existing Anglo-American polit- ical system as our democratic ideal, but it has also resulted in a ‘‘democratic’’ theory that in many respects bears a strange resemblance to the anti-democratic arguments of the last century. No longer is democratic theory centred on the participation of ‘‘the people,’’ on the participa- tion of the ordinary man, or the prime virtue of a democratic political system seen as the devel- opment of politically relevant and necessary qualities in the ordinary individual; in the con- temporary theory of democracy it is the partici- pation of the minority e´lite that is crucial and the non-participation of the apathetic, ordinary man lacking in the feeling of political e‰cacy, that is regarded as the main bulwark against instability.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=108,0,169,49|democracy-sourcebook, page 56]]

The author critiques current democratic theory. Interestingly despite having completely opposed theories to [[Defining and Developing Democracy - Larry Diamond|Larry Diamond]] I think she makes a similarly unfair criticism of Schumpeter's theory (and procedural democracy more generally). Its not necessarily only the elites that are active, its just that others will activate only (or at least mostly) when there are issues which are directly important to them (of course you can still see this as bad but I think the characterisation is unfair).

> Yet we have seen that the evidence supports the arguments of Rousseau, Mill and Cole that we do learn to participate by participating and that feelings of political efficacy are more likely to be developed in a participatory environment. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that experience of a participatory authority structure might also be effective in diminishing tendencies toward non-democratic attitudes in the individual. If those who come newly into the political arena have been previously ‘‘educated’’ for it then their participation will pose no dangers to the stability of the system. Oddly enough, this evidence against the argument from stability should be welcomed by some writers defending the contemporary theory, for they occasionally remark that they deplore the low levels of political participation and interest that now obtain.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=56&selection=194,10,210,45|democracy-sourcebook, page 56]]

This seems interesting. I wish the evidence was cited. (Perhaps we can find it in her book?)

> Today, the question of economic e‰ciency is bound to loom very large in any discussion of the issues involved in democratising industrial authority structures; in particular how far the economic equality implied in a system of indus- trial democracy would be compatible with e‰- ciency. Economic equality is often dismissed as of little relevance to democracy yet once industry is recognised as a political system in its own right then it is clear that a substantive measure of economic equality is necessary. If inequalities in decision-making power are abolished the case for other forms of economic inequality becomes correspondingly weaker.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=58&selection=3,0,26,23|democracy-sourcebook, page 58]]

The author discusses efficiency vs democracy and equality in industry. 

>  In the first place it is only if the individual has the opportunity directly to participate in decision making and choose rep- resentatives in the alternative areas that, under modern conditions, he can hope to have any real control over the course of his life or the devel- opment of the environment in which he lives. Of course, it is true that exactly the same decisions are not made, for example, in the workplace as in the House of Commons or the Cabinet, but one may agree with Schumpeter and his fol- lowers in this respect at least: that it is doubtful if the average citizen will ever be as interested in all the decisions made at national level as he would in those made nearer home. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=59&selection=28,25,42,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 59]]

The author emphasizes local participation and suggests that some of Schumpeter's intuitions are less likely to apply here. 

> The ordinary man might still be more interested in things nearer home, but the exis- tence of a participatory society would mean that he was better able to assess the performance of representatives at the national level, better equipped to take decisions of national scope when the opportunity arose to do so, and better able to weigh up the impact of decisions taken by national representatives on his own life and immediate surroundings. In the context of a participatory society the significance of his vote to the individual would have changed; as well as being a private individual he would have multi- ple opportunities to become an educated, public citizen.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=59&selection=76,9,126,8|democracy-sourcebook, page 59]]

The author also suggests that local participation can breed (positive) participation on the national level. 
## Overall Thoughts

I thought the author brought up a lot of good points and examples to argue for participatory democracy although like many of the previous articles I feel like the excerpt was a little sparse of detail. She suggests that the empirical evidence supports her claims but none of that evidence is given or even cited. Perhaps the most central pillar of her argument is the idea that the lack of interest in participation of citizens is a function of our current society itself. Once again this has been a re-occurring theme throughout the debate on the definition of democracy about the extent to which individuals are "naturally" interested in democratic participation and how this is effected by their environment. I am still not sure where I stand on this issue. Another interesting topic of the excerpt is democratization of industry and what seems to be a prescription of worker co-ops. This is a topic I am very interested in but again the strength of her argument at least somewhat lie on the relative trade-off of efficiency vs equality (especially if a sufficient amount of that efficiency does improve general welfare). Of course I am not sure how to determine this (theoretically or experimentally).
