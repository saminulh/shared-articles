### Notes

> “How to find a form of association which will defend the person and goods of each member with the collective force of all, and under which each individual, while uniting himself with the others, obeys no one but himself, and remains as free as before.”

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=68,0,73,17|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

> These articles of association, rightly under- stood, are reducible to a single one, namely the total alienation by each associate of himself and all his rights to the whole community. . . .

> There is often a great difference between the will of all \[what all individuals want\] and the general will; the general will studies only the common interest while the will of all studies pri- vate interest, and is indeed no more than the sum of individual desires. But if we take away from these same wills, the pluses and minuses which cancel each other out, the balance which remains is the general will.

### Questions and Comments

> The articles of this contract are so precisely determined by the nature of the act, that the slightest modification must render them null and void

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=75,0,78,4|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

Never would have thought “the social contract” was an actual precisely stated contract (and implicitly unanimously signed by society)

> if ever the social pact is violated, every man regains his original rights and, recovering his natural freedom, loses that civil freedom for which he exchanged it.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=81,0,96,22|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

What are the original rights and natural freedoms? Is murder allowed or does it violate the original rights of the victim? Both answers seem weird: murder not allowed is weird because it seems the constraints on murder are imposed socially rather than naturally and murder allowed is weird because it seems that there are no “original rights” to speak of.

> The public person thus formed by the union of all other persons was once called the city, and is now known as the republic or the body politic.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=117,6,129,1|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

This makes me appreciate the term “body politic” more lol.

Everyone is simultaneously citizen and subject (i.e., part of both sides of the social contract)

> whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do so by the whole body, which means nothing other than that he shall be forced to be free

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=38,12,41,26|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

I don’t understand this. It could mean that those that violate the social contract are expelled from the population, but that’s typically not the exclusive punishment (e.g., imprisonment).

> The people is never corrupted, but it is often misled; and only then does it seem to will what is bad.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=57,36,59,38|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

Doubt.

> From the deliberations of a people properly informed, and provided its members do not have any communication among themselves

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=81,0,83,34|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

What does it mean to have deliberations without communication? Maybe theres a notion of a public forum where all public discussion must take place (essentially disallowing the groups he later talks about)?


“Small differences” seems to be a key supposition of this framework. I wonder if he believed that all people are fundamentally only mildly different from others or that you can only have this ideal state for certain populations.

> as we shall see, it cannot hurt any particular member.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=11,39,12,42|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

Did I miss this, where does he do this?

### Final Thoughts

Overall the idea seems to be that the premise of society is for everyone to give up some freedoms and enjoy the benefits of collective action. The deliberative process is obviously highly idealized and nearly meaningless, but a key point of emphasis seems to be for individuals should “make up their own mind” and then everyone comes together to mix together their own ideas.

It’s fun to think about the analogy of the body politic to the human body. I suppose here then the individuals constituting the body politic is analogous to cells in a body. To extend this analogy further, we should be okay with groups taking part in politics, as this would be analogous to organs. This would be compatible with the last sentences of this essay, where he argues that there be many groups and prevent inequality between them (though it’s not clear to me why we should prefer the non-group society to the many-groups society).
