## Notes
> “How to find a form of association which will defend the person and goods of each member with the collective force of all, and under which each individual, while uniting himself with the others, obeys no one but himself, and remains as free as before.” ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=68,0,73,17|page 15]])

> These articles of association, rightly under- stood, are reducible to a single one, namely the total alienation by each associate of himself and all his rights to the whole community. . . . ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=97,0,100,44|page 15]])

> There is often a great difference between the will of all \[what all individuals want\] and the general will; the general will studies only the common interest while the will of all studies pri- vate interest, and is indeed no more than the sum of individual desires. But if we take away from these same wills, the pluses and minuses which cancel each other out, the balance which remains is the general will.

### Questions and Comments

> The articles of this contract are so precisely determined by the nature of the act, that the slightest modification must render them null and void ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=75,0,78,4|page 15]])
* Never would have thought “the social contract” was an actual precisely stated contract (and implicitly unanimously signed by society)

> if ever the social pact is violated, every man regains his original rights and, recovering his natural freedom, loses that civil freedom for which he exchanged it. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=81,0,96,22|page 15]])
* What are the original rights and natural freedoms? Is murder allowed or does it violate the original rights of the victim? Both answers seem weird: murder not allowed is weird because it seems the constraints on murder are imposed socially rather than naturally and murder allowed is weird because it seems that there are no “original rights” to speak of.
* Answer: there is a “natural law” (that the state should protect) and murder is a violation of natural law.

> The public person thus formed by the union of all other persons was once called the city, and is now known as the republic or the body politic. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=117,6,129,1|page 15]])
* This makes me appreciate the term “body politic” more lol.
* Everyone is simultaneously citizen and subject (i.e., part of both sides of the social contract)

> whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do so by the whole body, which means nothing other than that he shall be forced to be free ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=38,12,41,26|page 16]])
* I don’t understand this. It could mean that those that violate the social contract are expelled from the population, but that’s typically not the exclusive punishment (e.g., imprisonment).
* David: the general will is what enables society’s “freedom” and so opposing the general will means you oppose freedom (and must be forced into it?).

> The people is never corrupted, but it is often misled; and only then does it seem to will what is bad. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=57,36,59,38|page 16]])
* Doubt.

> From the deliberations of a people properly informed, and provided its members do not have any communication among themselves ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=81,0,83,34|page 16]])
* What does it mean to have deliberations without communication? Maybe theres a notion of a public forum where all public discussion must take place (essentially disallowing the groups he later talks about)?

“Small differences” seems to be a key supposition of this framework. I wonder if he believed that all people are fundamentally only mildly different from others or that you can only have this ideal state for certain populations.

> as we shall see, it cannot hurt any particular member. ([[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=11,39,12,42|page 16]])
* Did I miss this, where does he do this?
* Answer: its elsewhere in the book lol
## Final Thoughts
Overall the idea seems to be that the premise of society is for everyone to give up some freedoms and enjoy the benefits of collective action. The deliberative process is obviously highly idealized and nearly meaningless, but a key point of emphasis seems to be for individuals should “make up their own mind” and then everyone comes together to mix together their own ideas.

It’s fun to think about the analogy of the body politic to the human body. I suppose here then the individuals constituting the body politic is analogous to cells in a body. To extend this analogy further, we should be okay with groups taking part in politics, as this would be analogous to organs. This would be compatible with the last sentences of this essay, where he argues that there be many groups and prevent inequality between them (though it’s not clear to me why we should prefer the non-group society to the many-groups society).

> ‘‘How to find a form of association which will defend the person and goods of each member with the collective force of all, and under which each individual, while uniting himself with the others, obeys no one but himself, and remains as free as before.’’ This is the fundamental problem to which the social contract holds the solution.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=68,0,74,48|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

The goal of the state (and the social contract) according to Rousseau. 

> The articles of this contract are so precisely determined by the nature of the act, that the slightest modification must render them null and void; they are such that, though perhaps never formally stated, they are everywhere the same, everywhere tacitly admitted and recognized; and if ever the social pact is violated, every man regains his original rights and, recovering his natural freedom, loses that civil freedom for which he exchanged it.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=75,0,96,22|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

When and what happens when the social contract is broken according to Rousseau. (seems too loose to be realistic)

> If, then, we eliminate from the social pact everything that is not essential to it, we find it comes down to this: ‘‘Each one of us puts into the community his person and all his powers under the supreme direction of the general will; and as a body, we incorporate every member as an indivisible part of the whole.’’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=15&selection=101,0,107,35|democracy-sourcebook, page 15]]

The essential element of the social contract according to Rousseau. 

> Now, as the sovereign is formed entirely of the individuals who compose it, it has not, nor could it have, any interest contrary to theirs; and so the sovereign has no need to give guarantees to the subjects, because it is impossible for a body to wish to hurt all of its members, and, as we shall see, it cannot hurt any particular member. The sovereign by the mere fact that it is, is always all that it ought to be.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=6,0,14,20|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

> For every individual as a man may have a private will contrary to, or di¤erent from, the general will that he has as a citizen. His private interest may speak with a very di¤erent voice from that of the public interest; his absolute and naturally independent existence may make him regard what he owes to the common cause as a gratuitous contribution, the loss of which would be less painful for others than the payment is onerous for him; and fancying that the artificial person which constitutes the state is a mere ficti- tious entity (since it is not a man), he might seek to enjoy the rights of a citizen without doing the duties of a subject. The growth of this kind of injustice would bring about the ruin of the body politic

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=19,0,34,7|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

In more modern terms it appears Rousseau is suggesting the existence of a universal utility function for the entirety of society which each individual ought to contribute to, but some may not. 

> Hence, in order that the social pact shall not be an empty formula, it is tacitly implied in that commitment—which alone can give force to all others—that whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do so by the whole body, which means nothing other than that he shall be forced to be free; for this is the necessary condition which, by giving each citizen to the nation, secures him against all personal dependence, it is the condition which shapes both the design and the working of the political machine, and which alone bestows justice on civil contracts —without it, such contracts would be absurd, tyrannical and liable to the grossest abuse. . . .

Rousseau believes that since the social contract (as he outlined) is necessary to preserve freedom, forcing someone to follow the general will is equivalent to forcing someone to be free. You can see how this ends up being used to justify the reign of terror and other atrocities during the French revolution. 

> There is often a great difference between the will of all \[what all individuals want] and the general will; the general will studies only the common interest while the will of all studies private interest, and is indeed no more than the sum of individual desires. But if we take away from these same wills, the pluses and minuses which cancel each other out, the balance which remains is the general will.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=60,0,80,20|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

Once again we see that the general will appears to be some sort of general utility function. 

> But if groups, sectional associations are formed at the expense of the larger association, the will of each of these groups will become general in relation to its own members and private in relation to the state; we might then say that there are no longer as many votes as there are men but only as many votes as there are groups. The differences become less numerous and yield a result less general.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=16&selection=86,6,108,32|democracy-sourcebook, page 16]]

This view will obviously contrast heavily with many democratic thinkers who value "cross-cutting cleavages"

> But if there are sectional associations, it is wise to multiply their number and to prevent inequality among them, as Solon, Numa and Servius did.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=17&selection=21,31,24,31|democracy-sourcebook, page 17]]

Although he does make this concession later on. 
### Overall Thoughts

I can see that this article may have been insightful for its time but I do not think it has aged well. It just seems like a very unnuanced and unsophisticated view of society from today's standards.
