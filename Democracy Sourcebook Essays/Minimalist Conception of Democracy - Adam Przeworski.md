## Notes

> Almost all normatively desirable aspects of political, and sometimes even of social and economic, life are credited as intrinsic to de- mocracy: representation, accountability, equal- ity, participation, justice, dignity, rationality, security, freedom, . . . , the list goes on

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=27,2,40,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

> if the point of departure is that in any society there are conflicts, of values and of interests, electing rulers appears nothing short of miraculous.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=81,45,84,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

> I take it as obvious that we want to avoid bloodshed, resolving conflicts through violence. Starting with this assumption, I first argue that the mere possibility of being able to change governments can avoid violence. Secondly, I argue that being able to do it by voting has consequences of its own.

> As Hardin (1989: 113) puts it, ‘‘for the consti- tutional case, the ultimate source \[of stability\] is the internal costs of collective action for re- coordination or, in Caesar’s word, mutiny.’

> So why do we have democracy: an agreement to toss a coin with probabilities e and (1  e)? The reason, in my view, is that it would be impossible to write a dictatorial contract that would specify every contingent state of nature. In turn, leaving the residual control—control over issues not explicitly regulated by contract— to the dictator would generate increasing returns to power and undermine the contract.

### The Random Election Model
In this system, the election between two parties is determined by a (possibly biased) coin.
The governing party is allowed to do whatever within the bounds of the constitution.

This system is **completely unrepresentative**: no democratic input whatsoever and therefore no incentive to behave well, inside or outside of office. However, the cost of violence versus promised returns in the future may lead to this system still persisting: the loser of a given election is incentivized by potential future election wins to maintain the system and the winner of the election is incentivized to hold the next election due to the costs of violence.

Essentially, this forms a sort of cartel between the two parties with a randomized profit-sharing scheme. The question then arises, why have this randomization (or electoral randomness) and not just maintain a pre-arranged profit-sharing scheme.
### Questions and Comments

> True, as the modernization theory (notably Coser 1959) emphasized, these conflicts can be ‘‘cross-cutting’’: they need not pit class against class or religion against religion.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=101,19,104,53|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

This is in the context of caveating the anti-consensualist view. But I don’t quite see how this can help the consensualist position, “cross-cutting” conflicts seem like they still ought to make consensus difficult for any particular issue.

Re [[#^c1def8]]: This is the (first?) minimal axiom. Restating, the axiom is that everyone (except sadists and such?) derives disutility from violence in resolving conflicts. Surely there are factions that derive positive utility from some amount of violence (e.g., Nazis purging Jews), but is that considered within the bounds of the axiom because this violence isn’t towards the end of resolving a conflict (although the Jews’ interests are in conflict with the Nazis’ here)?

### Reading Notes 


> Almost all normatively desirable aspects of political, and sometimes even of social and economic, life are credited as intrinsic to democracy: representation, accountability, equality, participation, justice, dignity, rationality, security, freedom, . . . , the list goes on

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=27,2,40,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

I pointed out an example of this in the foreign affairs article [[The Costs of El Salvador’s Crime Crackdown - by Gustavo Flores-Macías#^1ebc4b| The Costs of El Salvador's Crime Crackdown]] where the author seems to treat rights and freedoms as intrinsic to democracy. 

> a system in which governments are elected is not worthy of being called ‘‘democracy’’ unless x is fulfilled or that democracy in the minimal sense will not endure unless x is satisfied. The first claim is normative, even if it often hides as a definition. The second is empirical. . . .

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=43,30,52,19|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

Przeworski describes the way in which people try to fit their normative claims into the definition of democracy. 

> If one begins with a vision of a basic harmony of interests, a common good to be discovered and agreed to by a rational deliberation, and to be represented as the view of the informed majority, the fact that rulers are elected is of no particular significance. Voting is just a time-saving expedient (Buchanan and Tullock 1962) and majority rule is just a technically convenient way of identifying what everyone would or should have agreed to. Yet if the point of departure is that in any society there are conflicts, of values and of interests, electing rulers appears nothing short of miraculous.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=58,0,84,43|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

Przeworski contrasts the enlightenment view of converging consensus with one where dis-consensus is endemic to the human condition. 

> Let us put the consensualist view of democracy where it belongs—in the Museum of Eighteenth-century Thought—and observe that all societies are ridden with economic, cultural, or moral conflicts

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=85,0,101,17|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

As did Schumpeter.

> deliberation is a two-edged sword, for it may lead just to solidifying conflicting view

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=110,24,112,15|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

Good point.

>  Yet in the end, when all the coalitions have been formed, the practical con- sensus has been elaborated, and all arguments have been exhausted, conflicts remain.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=112,17,115,37|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

"You can't take the politics out of politics"

>  I take it as obvious that we want to avoid bloodshed, resolving conflicts through violence. 

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=117,19,117,45|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

While I think this is a reasonable assumption I think it is still interesting to ask if and why this is true. Perhaps by overlapping consensus? Perhaps [[Democratic Justice - Ian Shapiro]] has an answer?  ^3d34e8

> assume that governments are selected by a toss of a, not necessarily fair, coin: ‘‘heads’’ mean that the incumbents should remain in office, ‘‘tails’’ that they should leave. Thus, a reading of the toss designates ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers.’’ This designation is an instruction what the winners and the losers should and should not do: the winners should move into a White or Pink House or perhaps even a palacio; while there they can take everything up to the constitutional constraint for themselves and their supporters, and they should toss the same coin again when their term is up. The losers should not move into the House and should accept getting not more than whatever is left.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=26&selection=19,19,63,36|democracy-sourcebook, page 26]]

Przeworski's thought experiment where the new government is chosen by the flip of a coin. 

>  any link between elections and repesentation is severed.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=26&selection=73,12,74,23|democracy-sourcebook, page 26]]

> Yet the very prospect that governments would alternate may induce the conflicting political forces to comply with the rules rather than engage in violence, for the following reason. Although the losers would be better off in the short run rebelling rather than accepting the outcome of the current round, if they have a sufficient chance to win and a sufficiently large payout in the future rounds, they are better off continuing to comply with the verdict of the coin toss rather than fighting for power. Similarly, while the winners would be better off in the short run not tossing the coin again, they may be better o¤ in the long run peacefully leaving office rather than provoking violent resistance to their usurpation of power. Regulating conflicts by a coin toss is then a self-enforcing equilibrium (Przeworski 1991: chap. 1). Bloodshed is avoided by the mere fact that, a la Aristotle, the political forces expect to take turns.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=26&selection=75,0,117,14|democracy-sourcebook, page 26]]

Przeworski argues that in this thought experiment the winners and losers of government may still regulate their behaviour due to the "taking turns" mechanism. 

> Instead of a coin toss deciding who gets what, the distribution would be fixed to reflect the strength the conflicting political forces could muster in an open confrontation, x for one, (1 - x) for the other. So why do we have democracy: an agreement to toss a coin with probabilities e and (1 - e)?

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=27&selection=102,15,116,3|democracy-sourcebook, page 27]]

Przeworski asks why we choose Democracy rather than choose a distribution of resources based on the results of open conflict. 

> Voting authorizes compulsion. It empowers governments, our rulers, to keep people in jail,29 sometimes even to take their life, to seize money from some and give it to others, to regulate private behavior of consenting adults. Voting generates winners and losers, and it authorizes the winners to impose their will, even if within constraints, on the losers. This is what ‘‘ruling’’ is.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=27&selection=183,0,216,3|democracy-sourcebook, page 27]]

Przeworski states that voting authorises compulsion. But why? 

> What difference, then, does it make that we vote? One answer to this question is that the right to vote imposes an obligation to respect the results of voting. In this view, democracy persists because people see it as their duty to obey out- comes resulting from a decision process in which they voluntarily participated. Democracy is legitimate in the sense that people are ready to accept decisions of as yet undetermined content, as long as they can participate in the making of these decisions

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=28&selection=26,0,44,15|democracy-sourcebook, page 28]]

>  I do not find this view persuasive, however, either normatively or positively. Clearly, this is not the place to enter into a discussion of a central topic of political theory (Dunn 1996a: chap. 4) but I stand with Kelsen (1998 [1929]: 21) when he observes that ‘‘The purely negative assumption that no individual counts more than any other does not permit to deduce the positive principle that the will of the majority should prevail,’’ and I know no evidence to the effect that participation induces compliance.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=28&selection=44,16,77,11|democracy-sourcebook, page 28]]

This is a view I often hear expressed "in the real world".  Yet Przeworski disagrees. I am not fully convinced that this does not play a role in compliance. Participation may not induce compliance but belief in the principal of democracy may. 

> Yet I think that voting does induce compliance, through a different mechanism. Voting constitutes ‘‘flexing muscles’’: a reading of chances in the eventual war. If all men are equally strong (or armed) then the distribution of vote is a proxy for the outcome of war.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=28&selection=78,0,123,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 28]]

Przeworski instead suggests that voting induces compliance by estimating the outcome of open conflict (in the language of the model from before it is estimating a reasonable choice for e). 

> Clearly, once physical force diverges from sheer numbers, when the ability to wage war becomes professionalized and technical, voting no longer provides a reading of chances in a violent conflict. But voting does reveal information about passions, values, and interests. If elections are a peaceful substitute for rebellion (Hampton 1994), it is because they inform everyone who would mutiny and against what. They inform the losers—‘‘Here is the distribution of force: if you disobey the instructions conveyed by the results of the election, I will be more likely to beat you than you will be able to beat me in a violent confrontation’’—and the winners—‘‘If you do not hold elections again or if you grab too much, I will be able to put up a forbidding resistance.’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=28&selection=153,1,198,25|democracy-sourcebook, page 28]]

As we discussed the first time we read this article I think it is very debatable to what extent this is true (especially in modern society). 

> Dictatorships do not generate this information; they need secret police to find out. In democracies, even if voting does not reveal a unique collective will, it does indicate limits to rule. Why else would we interpret participation as an indication of legitimacy, why would we be concerned about support for extremist parties?

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=28&selection=198,27,205,16|democracy-sourcebook, page 28]]

This implies that even if Dictatorships were benevolent, they suffer from a lack of information which may cause violent conflict. 

> Here then are three facts: (1) democracies are more likely to survive in wealthy countries; (2) they are more likely to last when no single political force dominates; and (3) they are more likely to endure when voters can choose rulers through elections. And these facts add up: democracy lasts when it offers an opportunity to the conflicting forces to advance their interests within the institutional framework

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=29&selection=143,0,152,27|democracy-sourcebook, page 29]]

Przeworski summarizes conditions under which democracy is more likely to persevere. In the language of the previous model (1) says that the pie is sufficiently large, (2) says that the probability of winning an election "e" is not too close to 1 or 0, (3) says that "e" is estimated by voters (perhaps measuring relative strength of power). 


### Additional Questions and Comments

> Popper (1962: 124) defends it as the only system in which citizens can get rid of governments without bloodshed.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=8,46,11,14|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

Is this worth reading?

> unless x is fulfilled or that democracy in the minimal sense will not endure unless x is satisfied.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=45,19,48,0|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

> Widely cited statements in this vein are Weffort 1992 and Schmitter and Karl 1991, but the phrase is ubiquitous. Here is Shapiro (1996: 108): ‘‘If democracy does not function to improve the circumstances of those who appeal to it, its legitimacy as a political sys- tem will atrophy.’’ Even Kelsen (1988 [1929]: 38) poses the threat that ‘‘Modern democracy will not live unless the Parliament will show itself an instrument appropriate for the solution of the social questions of the hour.’’

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=25&selection=140,3,149,7|democracy-sourcebook, page 25]]

I would think there are even better (more diverse) examples (ones that appeal to values like equality, justice, freedom etc...).

### Overall Thoughts

I think the first thought experiment about deciding governments by a coin flip is thought provoking and insightful. I think its convincing that the "taking turns" aspect at least plays some role in the sustainability of democracy. More generally I think the dynamical approach to thinking about democracy (that under certain conditions all sides are incentivized to participate and comply) seems fruitful. After this rereading I agree with Sammy that the idea of voting being an estimate of forces in open conflict seems to far from reality in modern society.
