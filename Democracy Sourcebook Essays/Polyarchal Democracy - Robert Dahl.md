## Excerpts
> Suppose we observe that a majority prefers x to y, and x happens to be selected as government policy. Yet it may be that among the majority is a dictator; if he were in the minority, then y would be selected.

- A scenario where it’s hard to tell if the system is truly democratic

>  A totalitarian plebiscite might meet—and indeed in practice evidently often has met—these three conditions better than a national election or legislative de- cision in countries that most Western political scientists would call democratic. The crux of the problem is in our first question, what we take to constitute an expression of individual preference.

- The democratic procedures outlined in [[#^6c4d73]] are often met moreso in dictatorships than democracies.

> 4. Any member who perceives a set of alterna- tives, at least one of which he regards as pref- erable to any of the alternatives presently scheduled, can insert his preferred alternative(s) among those scheduled for voting. . . . \[W\]e must lay down a fifth condition operating in the prevoting period. 5. All individuals possess identical information about the alternatives

- Pre-voting condition about the ability to add alternatives and the availability of information

> 6. Alternatives (leaders or policies) with the greatest number of votes displace any alterna- tives (leaders or policies) with fewer votes. 7. The orders of elected o‰cials are executed.

## Questions and comments
* Re [[#^0ef49b]]: The Madisonian theory floated here is something I’ve been thinking as the most salient reason to prefer democracy over more, for example, instrumentally- or technocratically-oriented governmental models. Looking forward to finally reading those.
* Re [[#^48d085]]: Reminds me of the “knowledge is a justified true belief” conundrum lol.
* Re [[#^5416cc]]: Essentially the notion of exiting the political system. Also interesting that this exit need not take the form of revolution per se but also merely political apathy and disaffection.
* Re [[#^62e963]]: Really? I would have said the exact opposite (with liberalism, thought of in this case as a social attitude/philosophy, being the “prerequisite”)
## Final thoughts
Dahl writes like has is an alien visiting Earth for the first time, it’s kind of fascinating. I overall like this analytical approach and he uses it well to make a good case for the liberal ideas present (namely, free expression) in our operational understanding of democracy (rather than purely procedural considerations). The constitutional stuff felt under-discussed but I’m excited to get to that part of the book. I was also interested when he brought up the problem of intensities of preferences, but it seems like we don’t get to see that in this excerpt.

## Excerpts

> Examination of Madisonian and populistic theory suggests at least two possible methods one might employ to construct a theory of democ- racy. One way, the method of maximization, is to specify a set of goals to be maximized; democ- racy can then be defined in terms of the specific governmental processes necessary to maximize these goals or some among them. . . . Madisonian theory postulates a non-tyrannical republic as the goal to be maximized; populistic theory postulates popular sovereignty and political equality. A second way—this one might be called the descriptive method—is to consider as a single class of phenomena all those nation states and social organizations that are commonly called democratic by political scientists, and by exam- ining the members of this class to discover, first, the distinguishing characteristics they have in common, and, second, the necessary and sufficient conditions for social organizations possess- ing these characteristics.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=61&selection=4,0,32,26|democracy-sourcebook, page 61]]
- The author distinguishes between two ways of constructive a theory of democracy. Maximisation vs descriptive.  ^0ef49b

> These are not, however, mutually exclusive methods. And we shall see that if we begin by employing the first method it will soon become necessary to employ something rather like the second as well.

 [[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=61&selection=33,0,37,15|democracy-sourcebook, page 61]]
- The author states that actually the maximisation approach will necessarily lead to employing aspects of the descriptive approach. 

> However, let us now pose the key question in slightly di¤erent form: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for maximizing democracy in the real world? I shall show that the words ‘‘in the real world’’ fundamentally alter the problem.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=61&selection=50,30,55,40|democracy-sourcebook, page 61]]
- The author poses the question: "What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for maximizing democracy in the real world?"

> Let us begin, however, with a meticulous con- cern for precision of meaning. First, what do we mean by ‘‘maximizing democracy’’? Evidently here, . . . we must proceed by regarding democ- racy as a state of a¤airs constituting a limit, and all actions approaching the limit will be max- imizing actions. But how shall we describe the state of a¤airs constituting the limit?

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=61&selection=56,0,63,39|democracy-sourcebook, page 61]]
- Maximizing democracy "as a limit"

> The model of populistic democracy suggests three possible characteristics that might be made operationally meaningful: (1) Whenever policy choices are perceived to exist, the alternative selected and enforced as governmental policy is the alternative most preferred by the members. (2) Whenever policy choices are perceived to ex- ist, in the process of choosing the alternative to be enforced as government policy, the preference of each member is assigned an equal value. (3) The Rule: In choosing among alternatives, the alternative preferred by the greater number is selected.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=61&selection=64,0,76,9|democracy-sourcebook, page 61]]
- Operational Characteristics of populistic democracy 

> The e¤ect of the argument so far is to divide our key question into two: (1) What acts shall we consider su‰cient to constitute an expression of individual preferences at a given stage in the decision process? (2) Taking these acts as an expression of preferences, what events must we observe in order to determine the extent to which the Rule is employed in the organization we are examining? We are still looking, let us re- member, for a set of limiting conditions to be approached.

[[democracy-sourcebook.pdf#page=62&selection=111,0,123,11|democracy-sourcebook, page 62]]
- The problem has been split into two questions

> At a minimum, two stages need to be distinguished: the election stage and the interelection stage. The election stage in turn consists of at least three periods which it is useful to distinguish: the voting period, the prevoting period, and the postvoting period. . . . During the voting period we would need to observe the extent to which at least three conditions exist:
> 1. Every member of the organisation performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives, e.g., voting. 
> 2. In tabulating these expressions (votes), the weight assigned to the choice of each individual is identical. 
> 3. The alternative with the greatest number of votes is declared the winning choice.

> . . . It is reasonable to suppose that the less the agreement on policy choices, the more di‰cult it will be in any organization to train members in the eight norms. For then, although the oper- ation of the rules may confer benefits on some members, it will impose severe restraints on others. If the results are severe for relatively large numbers, then it is reasonable to suppose that those who su¤er from the operation of the rules will oppose them and hence resist training in them. Thus: 
> 6. Social training in the eight norms increases with the extent of consensus or agreement on choices among policy alternatives.

- super interesting 

> Yet if the theory of polyarchy is roughly sound, it follows that in the absence of certain social prerequisites, no constitutional arrangements can produce a nontyrannical republic.

## Questions and Comments 
- Re [[#^0ef49b]]: I make a very similar point [[Defining and Developing Democracy - Larry Diamond#^3d76e3|here]] when I distinguished the approach of Schumpeter and Przeworski to the approach that Diamond used. (Although I feel that there are descriptive and maximisation elements of both) 
- Re [[#^9db5d2]] sort of a counter claim to Zakaria.  ^62e963
## Overall Thoughts

Dahl is an extremely analytical and thorough writer/thinker (although this makes the excerpt somewhat hard to read). As stated in the introduction I do think this excerpt does a good job of including many of the considerations in the previous excerpts and how they relate in a perhaps somewhat structural way. I'm not sure this excerpt has given me any stronger convictions but I think it provided a good framework for thinking about some of the "trade-offs" and "interactions" we have discussed/thought about in previous chapters. I think it would definitely be worth reading more about his theory of Polyarchy.
