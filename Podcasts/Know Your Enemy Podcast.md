## Behind Enemy Lines

This episode was an introduction to the podcast and the hosts

- They mention that Cory Robin's in "The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump" argues that conservatism is fundamentally a reactionary movement, in particular a reaction to the loss (or threat of loss) of power. 
- Matt mentioned that one of the initial cracks in his conservatism came from watching his peers defend torture in the Iraq war. This reminds me of my initial cracks with libertarianism coming from watching figures such as Stephan Molyneux and others defend ideas (on the right) that started to seem "clearly" morally wrong to me (unfortunately I have trouble remembering the examples).
- Funny Quote: Often its not "facts don't care about your feelings its feelings don't care about your facts"
- Its worth noting that one of Matt's (leftist) mentors Micheal Kazin argued: "no Democrat will win the presidency in 2020 unless she or he can mobilize a broad coalition in which socialists would still be a distinct minority. In the United States, a strategic alliance between liberals and leftists is the only way durable changes have ever been won ... Abolitionists who joined the Republican Party drove Radical Reconstruction; union activists with socialist convictions helped make the Democrats a semblance of a labor party in big industrial states; the black freedom movement worked with white liberals to pass the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. Such coalitions were short-lived and frustrated radicals who wanted more far-reaching results. But when liberals and leftists remained at odds, as during the final decades of the past century, they made it easier for the right to triumph." Perhaps this might explain why they seem less antagonistic to liberals than other leftists (although maybe they will discuss their views on liberalism in future episodes).

## How Conservatives Argue

The main topic of this episode was Albert Hirschman's 1991 book "The Rhetoric of Reaction"

- Modern conservatives begins with the French Revolution and Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France"
- In discussing the futility thesis, Hirschman mentions that it is also used by radical leftists who push back against incremental reform. Sam mentions that he doesn't know where he stands on the "revolutionary vs reform" argument taking place among the left. 
- In addressing his leftist critique of the "Synergy Illusion"  Matt mentions that he agrees that it is a cautionary tail for leftists that there are costs to reform but that the left deems them worth it. I think this hilariously misses the point.

## How Conservatives Argue
* Perversity thesis: If you try to effect some change you will inevitably do the opposite
* Futility thesis: Whatever you try won't work
* Jeopardy thesis: Change will cause other previous benefits to be lost
## The Death of Conservatism
### Burkean conservatism
* stability, accommodation, compromise, adjustment, minor shifts
### Movement conservatism
* Want to upset the apple cart.
* Enforce and implement an orthodoxy line.
	* At some point, the orthodoxy reacted to real problems at the time.
	* Once the orthodoxy calcified, it became out of touch with reality (e.g., the recession).
* Framing as the besieged minority while being the silent majority.
* Didn't necessarily think the Republicans will be the vessel for their ideological project. Rightly expressed concerns about Eisenhower.
* The biggest achievement of this movement was focusing into electoral politics and taking over the Republican party. For example, they never denounce their fringe (unlike the left)
* Tanenhaus' claim is that movement conservatism of the 20th century died with the failures of the Bush administration (who was a conservative ideologue) and the ascendance of Obama, who he sees as a Burkean conservative type.
* Ideologues were okay with Reagan despite his shortcomings, maybe due to charisma and personality
	* This patience started to wear thin by the 90s and then with Bush
	* Ends in the Iraq War and the Great Recession
		* The Cold War was a better theater for their ideas than the War on Terror
	* They have no answer to all of this at this point
* Maybe these ideological battles within conservatism didn't really matter and broader phenomena and reactions are what is actually going on
### Whitaker Chambers
* Ex-communist
* Burkean conscience to the conservative universe
* Warns Buckley against self-destructive puritanical radicalism.
* Believed (presumably due to Marxist/dialectical beliefs) that we could not turn back time on the New Deal.
* Denounces Ayn Rand
### Wilmore Kendall
* Advisor to Buckley
* Defender of majoritarianism
### William F. Buckley, Jr.
* Wrote "God and Man at Yale"
	* the first book about conservatives whining about colleges
	* "Conservatives as minority are the new radicals"
* Also wrote a book defending McCarthy
* Co-wrote with his brother-in-law, Brent Bozell
* Comes to believe that the "opinion makers" are in league with the liberal elites. Leads to the conception of the National Review
* Runs for mayor of NYC in 1965 and only got 15% of the vote
	* But did very well in religious places like Queens. A signal of the religious base.
* Served as a gatekeeper for the movement
	* Denounces Ayn Rand
* New Englander but had Southern background too
### James Burnham
* Wrote "The Managerial Revolution"
* Wrote "The Machiavellians"
	* Representing the futility thesis
* Predicted the Axes would win
* Saw a coming age of revolution because of an increasing concentration power of the state
* Ex-Trotskyist (actually knew Trotsky lol)
* From Trotskyism to movement conservatism, always viewed things in Manichaean terms
### Sam Francis
* Super racist forerunner to Trump
* Paleoconservative
* Wrote about Burnham which formed intellectual backbones for Trumpism
	* White people have interests. As do other races, but there's nothing wrong with viewing these along racial lines.
### Russell Kirk
* Wrote "The Conservative Mind" in the 50s
	* Inspired the movement
### Joseph McCarthy
* McCarthyism is an expression of higher conformity
	* The majority had a right to enforce a kind of orthodoxy on society
* Not an intellectual, but played a big role in the early movement's thinking
* Not just an attack on the cultural subversives, but also the bureaucratic state
	* Gave a roadmap to this kind of attack, e.g, "Drain the swamp"
* Ultimately all this was is just a revanchist populist defense of majority orthodoxy
* Still a person captured by the conservative imagination
### Barry Goldwater
* Had ideological manifest "The Conscience of a Conservative," ghostwritten by Brent Bozell
* Rejected the notion that people were post-ideological (which people believed due to Eisenhower)
	* Believed they were actually pre-ideological!
* Even though he lost the 1964 election, the right-wingers took over the Republican Party.
### Civil Rights Movement
* Moynihan Report
* National Review denounced Brown v. Board and defended segregation
	* Buckley would say the more "politically advanced" race should have power in the south
* Great fear in whites of civil unrest
### Ronald Reagan
* "Time of choosing" speech
* Elected governor of California in 1966
	* Followed the Watts riot in 1965
* Elected to conserve the white middle class gains
* Backed by many people in defense industry
* Did not radically reduce the size of the federal government
### Donald Trump
* Opposed by the National Review (at least initially)
* Not exactly in continuity with movement conservatism but not entirely separate
	* Promised to maintain Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security
	* Questioned the free-trade orthodoxy and had some amounts of economic populism
	* Campaigned against the Iraq War
* Can be seen as carrying on the ultimate (and primarily racial) goal of the conservative movement while changing the "superficial" policies as the current political climate requires
* Pat Buchanan is sort of a bridge from Nixon to Trump
### Additional Comments
* Sam Rosenfeld book "The Polarizers" about how parties were not (originally?) ideological vehicles.
* Another book called "The Other Side of the 60s," seems interesting.
* "Asymmetric Politics"
* "Suburban Warriors" by Lisa McGurr - about the tax revolts in California
