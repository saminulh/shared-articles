Haven’t read this, but it has some interesting factoids that can be worth keeping in mind when we go through Responsible Parties and stuff like that—particularly the analysis on herd behaviour (99.6% is pretty wild).
## [[House Inspection-A Retrospective of the 42nd Parliament.pdf#page=4&selection=83,0,83,12|Key Findings]]
1. **They like big bills**: Despite criticism of omnibus bills, the Government continued to introduce ever- larger bills, which can make serious scrutiny hard.
2. **Time (allocation) after time (allocation)**: The Government continued a much-criticized practice of frequently shutting down debate through time allocation.
3. **More tinkering**: Parliament spent more time studying Government bills, and amended more bills, largely due to the Senate’s new assertiveness in considering bills and challenging the Government and House of Commons.
4. **Herd behaviour**: The average MP voted with their party 99.6% of the time. The most rebellious MP in the 42nd Parliament: 96.6%.
5. **More collaboration, but things fell apart**: Committees more often reached consensus across party lines. But according to MPs, cross-party collaboration declined over the course of the Parliament as unhealthy partisanship increased.
6. **Trash talk**: MPs see debate as empty, repetitive, and a waste of valuable time. Despite efforts to promote civility in the House, heckling did not decrease in the 42nd Parliament.
