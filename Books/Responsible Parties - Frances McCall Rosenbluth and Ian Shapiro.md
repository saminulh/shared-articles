## Notes
### Prologue
> In a two-party system one party always represents the government and actually runs the country, so that, temporarily, the party in power becomes identical with the state. . . . Since the rule of each party is limited in time, the opposition party exerts a control whose efficiency is strengthened by the certainty that it is the ruler of tomorrow. . . . The multiparty system never allows any one man or any one party to assume full responsibility, with the natural consequence that no government, formed by party alliances, ever feels fully responsible. . . . Since the rise of the party systems it has been a matter of course to identify parties with particular interests, economic or others, and all Continental parties, not only these labor groups, have been very frank in admitting this. . . . The Anglo-Saxon party, on the contrary, founded on some “particular principle” for the service of the “national interest” is itself the actual or future state of the country; particular interests are represented in the party itself, as its right and left wing, and held in check by the very necessities of government.

* This quote introduces the main differences in the role of the party in the Continental multiparty system vs. the Anglo-Saxon two-party system.
### Chapter 1 -- Misdiagnosing Democracy's Ills
> Unlike closed-list PR systems in which centralized parties offer voters competing policy platforms, open-list PR allows voters to choose individual candidates, injecting an element of personal accountability. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=12&selection=14,35,17,60|page 12]])
* Closed-list PR centralized party power while open-list democratizes it

> Unlike closed-list PR systems in which centralized parties offer voters competing policy platforms, open-list PR allows voters to choose individual candidates, injecting an element of personal accountability. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=12&selection=14,35,17,60|page 12]])
* Seems to be the main thesis of the book
* Pro-democratization articles that they mention here:

|        | Two large--SMD | Multiple varied--PR           |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Strong | UK             | Northern Europe               |
| Weak   | US             | Eastern Europe, Latin America |

> Counterintuitively—since women and ethnic minorities are often among the outsiders fighting establishment politics—strong, centralized parties are also the best bet from the standpoint of vulnerable groups. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=16&selection=21,35,24,59|page 16]])
- It seems like one of the things the book needs to argue the most is protection against tyranny of the majority. They argue that the strong two-party system provides reasonable such coverage and that current trends for building in protections can conversely endanger vulnerable groups. 

> “I opened the doors of the Democratic Party and 20 million people walked out.” So said George McGovern, ruminating on the events that led to his crushing defeat by Richard Nixon in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=17&selection=42,0,45,39|page 17]])
- Primary reforms introduced by the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission]] backfired for the Democrats

> The damage McGovern was referring to extended well beyond his defeat. It involved changes to the party’s rules that helped solidify Nixon’s southern strategy, which capitalized on white working-class resentment of the civil rights reforms of the 1960s.  ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=18&selection=9,0,13,14|page 18]])
- Primary reforms solidified the success of the [[Southern Strategy]]

> This evolution has made the Democrats function more like the coalitions that are characteristic of PR systems, and less like the broad interest-based parties that we defend in chapter 4. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=20&selection=8,0,11,51|page 20]])
- From the initial reforms of the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission]] to [[Jesse Jackson]]'s 1984 candidacy and the [[Rainbow Coalition]], interests gave way to identity-based coalitions.

>  it becomes painfully apparent that the one color missing from the rainbow is white. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=20&selection=17,27,18,48|page 20]])
- Whites neglected by the new coalitions

> But it was not sufficient—as Estes Kefauver discovered in 1952. With President Truman’s popularity plummeting in the face of a bogged-down Korean War and the rise of McCarthyism, Kefauver won most of the primaries but was still denied the nomination by party bosses who saw him as an untrustworthy maverick. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=21&selection=15,23,20,37|page 21]])
- Primaries used to be less determinative. In 1952, [[Estes Kefauver]] won the primaries against [[Harry S Truman]] but lost the nomination.

> In 1968 Democrats held presidential primaries in seven- teen states and Republicans in sixteen; by century’s end the respective numbers were forty and forty-three ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=21&selection=24,0,26,45|page 21]])
- The number of primaries grew over the 20th century

> Weakened two-party competition has, among other things, created within the Republican Party a potent coalition between very rich, secular voters who finance campaigns or the sake of low taxes, and poor, white social conservatives who vote above all else against cultural dilution.  ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=21&selection=36,6,38,54|page 21]])
- Weaker parties led to the fusionist Republican coalition

> enacting laws, as distinct from casting votes for measures that legislators know will not become law, usually still requires support from the opposition party and its leadership to compensate for recalcitrant backbenchers in the majority party ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=22&selection=16,4,20,51|page 22]])
- When it matters, parties typically need to rely on cross-party support

> By the time they become law, these bills are hodgepodges of logrolling and special favors. This helps explain the otherwise bizarre spectacle of parties voting to pass laws that they know to be widely unpopular. Apparent party discipline conceals its opposite in these situations: legislators who are milking the system on behalf of narrow interests. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=22&selection=25,0,30,37|page 22]])
- What looks like party discipline is actually a lot of special favors and buying off of interests.
- Examples are [[Dodd-Frank]], [[Obamacare]], and the [[2017 Republican tax cut]]

> First, the parties are large—only two, more or less—which forces them both to aim for the political middle. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=23&selection=12,9,13,60|page 23]])
- The first of two requirements for the [[Westminster model]]: roughly two large parties

> Second, the fact that the system is parliamentary gives party leadership the clout needed to control the policy agenda ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=23&selection=17,47,19,45|page 23]])
- The second of two requirements for the [[Westminster model]]: party leadership can control the agenda

> countries like Australia and especially New Zealand have adopted electoral reforms that have undermined Westminster logic more extensively, diminishing their genealogy’s impact on the way they operate today. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=23&selection=31,49,33,57|page 23]])
- [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have undermined the Westminster system through reforms

> Favoring the majority at the expense of minorities is a substantial drawback, especially if some voters are permanently in a minority on any issue ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=24&selection=34,0,48,42|page 24]])
- Favouring the majority is a potential flaw with the Westminster model
- Discussed in more detail in chapter 3

>  the intense Brexiteers turned out in higher numbers than those who favored remaining in the EU—robbing the British electorate of a parliamentary discussion and vote that would have given priority to the broader and longer-term interests of the British people. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=26&selection=4,13,8,32|page 26]])

- Pro-[[Brexit]] turned in higher numbers than the pro-remain majority

>  The combination of interest group politics and relatively free trade has resulted in an impressive set of arrangements between employers and workers to invest in a highly skilled workforce that would be competitive within Europe and on the world market. These countries have tend- ed to have better worker protections, more after-tax income redistribution, and more generous employment and unemployment insurance, health insurance, and pension schemes. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=27&selection=9,24,16,58|page 27]])

- Continental democracies and PR have recently been performing very well

> A flaw of PR, from the voters’ point of view, is that it is harder to hold coalition governments accountable because voters do not know what coalitions will be formed after elections. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=27&selection=17,0,20,6|page 27]])
- Reduced accountability from PR due to coalitions

> Unions are shrinking as a proportion of the workforce as manufacturing declines, and with them goes a key constituency for social democratic parties. The result is a fragmentation of social democratic forces into multiple parties on the left. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=28&selection=5,25,9,29|page 28]])
^ce52d9
- Organized labor as a political bloc has been weakening, causing social democratic forces to fragment

> In PR systems, radical groups have less incentive to moderate their appeals and greater ability to hold the public hostage to intense minorities and highly polarized politics. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=28&selection=20,0,23,5|page 28]])
- PR systems don't incentivize moderation so radicals will appeal to intense minorities

> Other features of electoral systems also involve trade-offs— such as geographical versus nationwide representation or per- sonal connection with politicians versus allegiance to party platforms—but our focus here is on good public policy rather than on representation for its own sake. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=29&selection=15,0,19,40|page 29]])
- This book doesn't value representation as an intrinsic good

> France’s majority run-off elections institutionalize a place for small parties in throwing elections toward one of the big contenders.  ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=30&selection=13,0,15,53|page 30]])

- France's system

> Germany’s economy, the envy of the world, has long drawn attention to its mixed-member proportional electoral system, which apportions legislative seats according to proportionality but fills some seats via district-based plurality elections.  ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=30&selection=22,0,25,60|page 30]])
^534dc6
- Germany's system

>  New Zealand, Italy, Japan, and Mexico have all adopted variants of Germany’s system, but some key elements of the formula get lost in translation: the importance of two principal parties, top- down party control, and coalition deals that prohibit logrolling at the expense of general welfare ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=30&selection=28,54,33,33|page 30]])
- German model being exported with dubious implementations elsewhere

> Moreover, we show that even the German system has begun to creak under the pres- sures of slow growth, immigration, and party fragmentation— especially on the political left. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=30&selection=33,35,36,33|page 30]])
- German system is showing signs of weakness

> Open-list PR, common in much of Latin America and pushed by many democratic activists around the world, puts politicians in competition with members of their own parties for ranking on the list, and therefore for election. The electoral free-for-all created by intraparty competition motivates politicians to trade favors for votes, a recipe for endemic corruption. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=31&selection=27,16,30,64|page 31]])
- Open-list PR is common in Latin America and popular among activists

> In an ideal world, every electoral district would be diverse in ways that mirror the nation’s diversity across the range of issues that voters care about. The median voter in each district would resemble the national median voter, and their elected representatives would find it comparatively easy to agree on policy priorities. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=35&selection=7,24,12,49|page 35]])
^1b9673
- Every district should represent the median voter

> American geographic diversity puts that arrangement out of reach unless we were to adopt nongeographic districts, as Andrew Rehfeld recommends. ([[responsible-parties.pdf#page=35&selection=16,0,18,26|page 35]])
^6b70e6
- [[Andrew Rehfeld]] recommends nongeographic districts
## Thoughts
### Chapter 1 -- Misdiagnosing Democracy's Ills
- Re [[#^02c2a6]]: It's a bit interesting to consider whether this is wrong (in principle). If certain people feel more intensely about a particular issue, maybe they should (in the ideal world) have a bigger say.
	- Perhaps the way this should work is by people having a "budget" that they can allocate their votes from
	- OTOH, this might also just be achieved by the Westminster model in the sense that the two parties will try to make their platforms by taking preference intensities into account
- Re [[#^e167a9]]: This might be slowing down now, for example [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-10/biden-poised-to-impose-tariffs-on-china-evs-strategic-sectors).
- Re [[#^ce52d9]]: Is this somehow more of a problem in general for the left?
- Re [[#^d75b29]] and [[#^534dc6]]: We should learn about the French and German systems better
	- They say that the French system allows too much veto power for small parties
	- They don't seem as clearly negative on Germany's system, but are suspicious about its exportations
- TODO: Return to early American history [[responsible-parties.pdf#page=33&selection=7,0,43,59|here]]
- Re [[#^1b9673]] and [[#^6b70e6]]: The suggestion of all districts being like the country as a whole seems unrealistic (unless we adopt this idea from [[Andrew Rehfeld]] which seems wild)
