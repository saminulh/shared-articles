- Burke's *Reflections on the Revolution in France* is considered the first theoretical defence of modern conservatism. 

## Editor's Introduction - Written by Ian Hampsher-Monk

> Edmund Burke was born in Dublin in 1730 to a Catholic mother and a Protestant Father.1 He was educated in Ireland at both Catholic and Quaker schools, and at Dublin’s Anglican university, Trinity College, before studying law at the Middle Temple in London.

- Burke had a mixed Catholic and Protestant upbringing. 

> Although twice briefly Paymaster General (1782 and 1783), his major role was as opposition pamphleteer, political fixer, and spokesman for the Rockingham Whigs. Burke produced polemical writings and speeches on a wide range of issues critical of the government, opposing its con- troversial taxation policy in the American Colonies, seeking reform of the tangled skein of national and royal domestic finances, of the East India Company’s administration of British India, and, less publicly in that stridently Protestant age, to relieve the restrictions imposed on Irish Catholics in his home country.

> As this brief list reveals, Burke’s political life, down to 1789, was firmly identified with reform and, in party-political terms, opposed to the Tories. Of course the eighteenth-century Whig–Tory polarity does not map easily onto the modern radical–conservative distinction, which itself only emerged out of the revolutionary events that dominated the last eight years of Burke’s life. Nevertheless his opposition to the French Revolution surprised many, seeming to reverse his life-long commitment to reform and to liberty.

- Burke's political contributions were as a liberal fighting for reform. 

> *Reflections* was quickly recognised by contemporaries – foes and friends alike – as a definitive statement of anti-revolutionary principles; and has since been widely characterised as the founding statement of modern conservatism.

- Burke's *Reflections on the Revolution in France* is considered the founding statement of modern conservatism. 

> Readers coming to this text from the ‘tradition’ of early modern European political theory will be accustomed to the kind of systematic treatment we find in Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hume or Kant, in which epistemological preliminaries lead up to (or are implicated in) an account of human nature and moral psychology, to which is joined some account of pre or early social existence, and from which emerges, through contract or practice, political society

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=13&selection=44,70,51,27|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 13]]

- Burke's argumentation didn't follow the common formula of the western political philosophy tradition 

> They recognised that Burke wrote as a politician and a rhetorician, not as an academic or a philosopher. He wrote to persuade, not to satisfy canons of logic. Unlike philosophers, politicians and rhetoricians do not start from the most primordially imaginable propositions and derive conclusions from these; rather, they start from or appeal to propositions which may be unexamined but are thought by their audience to be true.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=14&selection=56,0,61,69|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 14]]

- Burke wrote as a politician rather than a philosopher

> Many, particularly those around Fox, were eager to read into the earlier stages of the French Revolution a version of what had happened in Britain in 1688. But the Whigs of 1688 were heroes for many not only because they constitutionalised the monarchy, but because they avoided a repeat of 1649, when Parliamentary and military rebels had abolished it. Having tried and beheaded the King they had unleashed social forces and a range of political and religious ideas of a volatile and socially disruptive kind. It was with this second image of the Whigs, as safeguards against ideological discontinuity and social violence from below, that Burke now identified; and it was he who warned that 1789 was to be 1649 again rather than 1688.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=18&selection=40,0,61,71|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 18]]

- A "liberal conservative" image of the Whig's which Burke identified with. He saw the French revolution as being similar to the (failed) English revolution of 1642 rather than the glorious revolution of 1688. 

> In England, a major constraint on the executive was parliament’s control over taxation and the purposes to which it could be put. Such considerations of political economy preoccupy Burke throughout large tracts of Reflections. Financially troubled absolutist regimes such as France might at any time declare bankruptcy –a policy option under frequent consideration there in the 1780s. A bankruptcy would convert the state’s debts into losses for the regime’s creditors. This risk increased the cost of borrowing for absolutist regimes: creditors simply charged higher interest rates to offset the increased risk of losing the capital value of their loan. It was the French monarchy’s failure to retain a sufficient tax-base to pay the interest on its loans that had forced the calling of the Estates General in the first place and so set the Revolution in train. However, in a parliamentary regime such as Britain’s, many members of the legislature were themselves creditors: they had an interest in ensuring the stability and viability of both the political regime and its finances. Because its political leaders were incentivised to secure the property rights of creditors, a parliamentary regime could borrow money more cheaply. Economic stability and political liberty – in the sense of protection from arbitrary sovereigns – were brought into harmony and secured by harnessing both to a class interest – that of the property- owners.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=23&selection=39,0,45,56|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 23]]

- The fact that many members of legislature in England where also creditors of the state meant that they had a vested interest in the stability of the government. 

> One way of characterising that difference is between rationalist, reformist politics and a procedurally conservative politics. The rationalist starts > from a set of principles – in this case those of natural right, or the rights of man – and seeks to deduce the features of a morally defensible political order from those principles. The presumption is that, if the principles are right, then all that is (legitimately) deduced from them will be so too. The task of politics is then conceived to be the reconstruction of the social world according to the principles. The procedural conservative, by contrast, begins with ‘really existing’ institutions and ideas which they take to be constitutive of a given political reality and then proceeds to sustain that reality, reforming as and where necessary in a piecemeal way so as always to maintain the functional integrity of the whole. This is to put the matter very abstractly, but not at a level unavailable to reflective eighteenth-century protagonists. 

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=27&selection=36,0,37,73|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 27]]

- The contrast between reformist and procedural conservative politics. 

> The adjective ‘procedural’ is used to signal a distinction between it and another kind of conservative, the substantive conservative, who defends one particular unchanging order – often religiously sanctioned – and who becomes indistinguishable from a reactionary, as that order recedes into the past.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=28&selection=45,0,48,36|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 28]]

- A distinction is made between procedural and substantive conservatives. 

> Burke clearly had particular views about specific aspects of the English constitution which he thought enabled it to function so well. But he did not regard constitutional monarchy as the uniquely eligible form of government. Republics, where they existed, he thought perfectly legitimate, and even regarded what he called a ‘spirit of republicanism’ as a possible – indeed sometimes the only – source of reform within monarchies.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=28&selection=15,33,21,25|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 28]]

- As an example of this distinction, Burke did not see constitutional monarchy as uniquely "best" or "correct". 

> But he thought the attempt to transform a whole political culture according to some principle extrinsic to its own history and practices was hugely dangerous, and he thought the attempt to reform on the principle of unqualified democracy (even though, as he pointed out, the institutional arrangements did not conform to it) was disastrous, as indeed it turned out to be.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=28&selection=24,0,29,42|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 28]]

- He predicted that redesigning society from the ground up based on a set of principles and ignoring the previous context in which it arose would be a disaster. 

> Burke thought that normative natural-rights claims – if successful – effectively overturn this inherited experience and restart institutional history with a clean slate. French protagonists and Thomas Paine make this quite explicit: it was because ‘the world is as new to every child as it was to the first man that existed, and his natural right in it is of the same kind’ that inherited institutional arrangements have only as much authority as successive generations choose to give them: ‘Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which preceded it.’

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=28&selection=30,0,41,31|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 28]]

- Thomas Paine thought that the social contract only had power over future generations if those future generations chose to give it power. 

> Burke thought such claims foolishly overestimate the capacity of individual human reasoning and ignored the accumulation of experience which is embodied in institutions and social practices – ‘Old establishments are tried by their effects . . . we conclude that to be good from whence good is derived’.55 The radical also presupposed an individual competence to judge and act on these matters, when in fact political wisdom is, Burke thought, necessarily social, collectively gained and held in institutions.

[[reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france.pdf#page=29&selection=2,0,15,16|reflections_on_the_revolution_in_france, page 29]]

- Burke thought that political wisdom is necessarily socially and collectively gained and held in institutions. 

>In the ‘Preface’ added to the second edition Burke explained that he had wanted ‘to shew that, without the Exertion of any considerable Forces, the same Engines i.e arguments which were employed for the Destruction of Religion, might be employed with equal success for the Subversion of Government.’ Over-confidence in our powers of reason could result in ‘attacking everything the most excellent and venerable’. What would become of the world, he asked, ‘if the Practice of all moral Duties, and the Foundations of Society, rested upon having their Reasons made clear and demonstrable to every Individual?’ In Burke’s question was entirely rhetorical, inviting the reader to agree how ridiculous and destructive such a demand was. But, now, thirty-five years later, the claim that inherited institutions should be made justifiable to the ordinary man – and even woman – was indeed being proclaimed by the French Revolution and its imitators in Britain and Ireland, who argued in real earnest what Burke had sketched as a satirical absurdity.

- Burke argued that it is absurd to suggest that the foundations of society must be justifiable by reason to every member of society. 

> In insisting on the distinction between the logical properties of ideas and their persuasive power, Burke moves from the terrain of Enlightenment philosophy to that of ideology. This is not an intention we can impute to him in those terms – the word ‘ideology’ would not be invented until shortly after his death – but it is a way of thinking about political argument to which Burke increasingly appeals, stressing that it is not the deductive consequences of natural rights, for example, to which we should pay attention, but the likely consequences of their being believed.

- Burke thought it was more important to pay attention to the material consequences of  beliefs rather than their logical deductive conclusions. 

> This view is irredeemably historical, and places huge emphasis on the need for individuals to be socialised into accepting their place and the institutions that govern them if the social order which keeps the state of nature at bay is to work. He accepted that political institutions are the apparently contingent products of historical circumstance (the ‘gifts of nature or of chance), and to that extent arbitrary. But the contingent origin of our political institutions is not (as so often claimed by the radical) a reason for abandoning, or at least a presumption against them; on the contrary, it is all the more reason for holding on to them. For Burke the contrast is not (as it is for the radical) between an arbitrary set of institutions and a better, more rational set, but between having the good fortune to possess stable institutions at all and the anarchy that we risk from rejecting what ‘time and chance’ have given us. Far from its being the case that stable institutions can be deduced from abstract principles, Burke thought that, in the absence of shared conventions – which only a specific historical culture provides – reason was incapable of deducing any specific arrangements. Moreover there are no ‘default’ institutions or natural practices to which we can be thought to revert once reason persuades us to abandon our inherited political forms. Even the device of majority decision-making, he thought, far from being a basis on which to establish political institutions was one of the most violent fictions of positive law . . . nature knows nothing of it; . . . rather it must be the result of a very particular and special convention, confirmed . . . by long habits of obedience’.

- For Burke there may be a level of arbitrariness to our social and political institutions but that is necessary to have stable institutions at all.
