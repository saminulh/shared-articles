- Burke's *Reflections on the Revolution in France* is considered the first theoretical defence of modern conservatism. 

## Editor's Introduction - Written by Ian Hampsher-Monk

> Edmund Burke was born in Dublin in 1730 to a Catholic mother and a Protestant Father.1 He was educated in Ireland at both Catholic and Quaker schools, and at Dublin’s Anglican university, Trinity College, before studying law at the Middle Temple in London.

Burke had a mixed Catholic and Protestant upbringing. 

> As this brief list reveals, Burke’s political life, down to 1789, was firmly identified with reform and, in party-political terms, opposed to the Tories. Of course the eighteenth-century Whig–Tory polarity does not map easily onto the modern radical–conservative distinction, which itself only emerged out of the revolutionary events that dominated the last eight years of Burke’s life. Nevertheless his opposition to the French Revolution surprised many, seeming to reverse his life-long commitment to reform and to liberty.

- Burke's political contributions were as a liberal fighting for reform. 

> *Reflections* was quickly recognised by contemporaries – foes and friends alike – as a definitive statement of anti-revolutionary principles; and has since been widely characterised as the founding statement of modern conservatism.
